====== Weekly Report ======
Highlights:
- Fixed Javadoc (webkit2) issue where opening external links would cause UI hang.

Last 7 Days:
- 530678 – [webkit2] UI hangs after navigating through Javadoc hover, when clicking an icon or link to an image.
  * Issue caused by deadlock in webkit process.
  * This is a regression starting with Webkit2.18. In 2.18 disposal mechanism was changed.
  * Occured if you dispose browser inside a callback from Webkit, as it caused
	webkit to wait for completion of callback which never completed.
  * To break the deadlock, I implemented logic to un-parent webkit and delay
	it's disposal.
  * Researched memory leaks in JNI. (these are separate from main heap)
  * Wrote a jUnit to verify that there no memory leaks in Webkit2 Browser dispoal logic.
  * This fix also fixed: 494158 – [Webkit1][Webkit2] JVM crash when javadoc hover has <embed> tags

- Investigated compute Browser size issue  (232501 - Browser#computeSize(..) does not compute size)
  * Problem is that given HTML, one can't really compute size because
	html doesn't specify sizes. Also there is dynamic content and font
	can be of different sizes. Images can be scaled arbitarily by css etc..
  * I.e, Browser widget size requires a notion of 'understanding' of what
	the user intends to present. Which can't realy be done at the widget level.
	I.e, this might be a wont-fix unless someone has a suggestion on this?

- 527729 – Dehardcode Adwaita CSS theme fixes
  * Implemented mechanism to only fix Adwaita issues if Adwaita system theme,
	so as to not break other themes. (review in progress)

- 532946 – Fix SwtTestUtil#isRunningOnEclipseOrgHudsonGTK

Patch review:
- 533124] [CTabFolder] Multi line text for tab title
 * Fix looks good overall.
 * Found corner case with dropdown menu. Discussing to use single line in the menu
   which pops up if you have more tabs than fit into the view.

(Misc Triage work)

Next week:
- Bug 531652 - Crash in webkit2 browser on fedora 27 inside Virtualbox
