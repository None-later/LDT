Highlights:

Last 7 days:
Webkit:
- Verified that Eclipse works well with new Webkit 2.20 (found in newer Fedora versions) works well.
- Investigated Webkit crash on VirtualBox + Fedora 27. 
	The crash doesn't occur anymore. -> WORKS_FOR_ME

- Investigated Webkit2 Crash on opening html file. #533545
   Issue doesn't occur for me for the same environment (RHEL 7.4),
   but I have a suspicion of what it might be. Wrote a patch for reporter to test.

Other:
- 32bit gtk build server failed whenever java got updated.
   I implemented a bash mechanism to locate Java path dynamically.
- User provided patch to add feature to SWT (Multi line CTabItem *text* (not tabs)).
	Reviewed/tested and worked with user until patch for merge.  # 533124
- Investigated bug report: 531378 â€“ Ctrl+ <keys> oblivious to keyboard layout


Next 7 days:
- Add SWT/Gtk quick start guide to further attract new SWT contributors (We've seen a few new contributors lately).
- Investigate visual glitch in Trees (earlier patch caused a regression)
