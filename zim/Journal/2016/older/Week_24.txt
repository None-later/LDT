Review gtk hackhafest: https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/GTK2016
Helped Ian a bit with Tracker bug.
Helped Sales guy with network issue 
Learned about jhbuild. Got it setup, build gtk+, eclipse runs in isolated environment.

Patch review: Bug 481195 - Update SWT to Java 8

=== Weekly report ===
(In Progress)
Bug 489025 – [gtk3] Task list does show task icon,
- mylyn Icons missing/cut off.
- Learned about GtkTree and SWT Tree internal implementations.
- Debugged/traced Mylyn -> Jface -> SWT path. (somewhat involved due to size of source code/complexity). 
- Issue lies with SwtPixBuf not expanding when setting new icons.
- Wrote fix that re-draws SwtPixBuf (based on Eric's former fix). But found that fix brakes other icons. Need to improve fix.
- Trying to isolate the issue down to a SWT snippet.

Gtk Hackafest:
- Spoke with Gtk developers, outline some issues that SWT faces with Gtk3.
- Got a feel for upcomming Gtk4 plans. 
- Investigated and got JHBuild working thanks to Gtk+ developer help. (for compiling latest gtk+ master, it auto-compiles dependencies)

Patch reviews:
- Bug 487160: [GTK3] Using ScrolledComposite in a multi-page Wizard results in improper sizing of widgets
- Bug 461354 - [GTK] Find a better solution for inserting elements into Table/Tree/List 
- Bug 481195 - Update SWT to Java 8

Other:
- Investigated Taiga.fedorainfracloud.org (open source tool) for use as ToDo system for SWT tasks for Me/Eric/Ian.
  It's like a micro-bugzilla for small teams. It's a bit buggy but seems to work.
- Thursday - Baseball game 
- Monday - Away for university convocation 
- Helped Sales with some technical issues on their Mac's.
- Learned how to do gerrit patch review through eclipse instead of command line/web interface. (Thank you Eric & Vogella tutorials).
- Experimented with Eclipse MyLyn UML-Lab. (It creates a UML diagram from your current mylyn context). 
   Unfortunatley their plugin doesn't scale well to SWT's large code base.

=== Wednesday 15 June (After WR) ===
Gtk+ meeting
Agenda:
- SWT fixed:
	- Need Container that does absolute sizing & manual control of re-stacking of children.
	- Manual lay-out of children. 
	- Manually move children.
	- *_for_all child traveral in reverse order for correct DnD behaviour.
	- Draw children beneath one another.
	- Maybe show them source code.
	-> Maybe use GtkFixed and GtkOverlay 
- JHBuild and Wayland? 

- Me& Eric Figured out why SwtFixed was introduced
— Found commit/bug where it was introduced. In Gtk3
— Manually re-stack children.

- Found better way to browse Gtk+ source code. Import JHBulid checkout sources.

- Triage. 
 

=== Thursday 16 June ===
- setup JHBuild for Ian, so he can work on Font issue that occurs on laterst gtk+.
- Discussion with Gtk+ people about SWTFixed
	-> use GtkOverlay. With Gtk3.18 added some functions.
	-> Maybe get them to add more functions that we want
	-> Maybe extend that container.


=== Friday 17 June ===
- mylyn: Found that issue doesn't occur that on mars, but occurs only on Neon.
- git bisect on SWT code base till I found commit that broke treeItem icons. (Eric's earlier patch).
- Found a way to use jhbuild to build older versions of gtk. (for bisecting gtk).
   (was given advice on Gtk+ channel)
   This was so Ian could disect which gtk+ broke fonts.
