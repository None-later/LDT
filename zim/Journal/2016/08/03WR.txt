Bug 497923 - [GTK] build.sh bugfixes and improvements
	- Newer bash syntax caused some execution errors on older build servers.
	- Updated build.sh to use older syntax like '[]' instead of ''
	  (as per Alex.K's observation)
	- Now build servers seem to be building again.

(In progress) 
Bug 430538 - [GTK3][webkit] Support Custom JavaScript execution in WebKit2 mode of SWT Browser
	- Working on converting an async call into a sync one:
	- Spent time investigating GTask framework, GLib's threading an GMutex and SWT's
	  'Call' mechanism, but found that those were not suitable for this task.
	  (WebKitGtk uses GTask internally, so using GTask on top of GTask could casuse issues,
	   also GTask is more for making Sync calls async as oppose to the other way around).
	-- Implemented a native C snippet that uses a simple spin-lock to convert async call into
	   a sync call, that uses g_main_context_iteration.
	-- Discussing with Alex about how to best port to SWT layer without causing dead-locks in SWT,
	   I will try to implement a non-recursive lock in WebKitGtk.java to simplify proceddure. 
		

Triage:
- 495561: When implementing Expandbar inside a composite the composite does not resize or redraw properly
  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=495561
  etc... 
- Tested Alex's path:
	Bug 498533 â€“ Binding for gtk_adjustment_* shouldn't be dynamic
	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=498533
	Doesn't cause test failures for me. Probably issue with old build server.

Other:
	- (As per request by Ian) Figured out how to compile GTK patches/changes with JHBuild (jhbuild buildone... )
	  This is for testing bugfix patches for latest gtk builds.
	  Documented it in SWT wiki.
	- Investigated and submitted bug to Mylyn tasks: Bug 499066 - Add 'Bug ' to commit message.
