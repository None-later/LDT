====== Wednesday 17 Aug 2016 ======
Last Week:

I've mostly been working on C side of SWT JNI bindings and various shell scripts.

Bug 430538 - Webkit2 Javascript port 
(Finished)	
* Stage 1 patch submitted for review. (Implement 'execute' support of Javascript).
	- My patch would not compile on machines without webkit2gtk4, so I researched 
	conditional evaluation in Makefiles and #ifdefn in C. (Similar to Sami's initial webkit patch, thank you Sami).
	Implemented conditional compilation so new code is only compiled with machines that have webkit2gtk4 installed. 
	(this took a while to figure out, read lots of material online).
	
	- Setup Fedora 21 VM for testing on older machines. 
	Researched how to quickly test changes from host on guest vm.
	Followed Roland's suggestion to use SSHFS to mount my host files into VM.
	This way I can run the Eclipse from my host machine on the VM and share the workspace
	as well as use the same git repo. I.e I can instantly test changes on older vm without
	pushing/pulling patches. I can keep source on host vm and compile on test VM.
	Thank you Roland for blogging about this.

* Stage 2 (next) will be for evaluating Javascript (i.e have a return value).

Bug 499545 - Investigated unsat link error
	- Recent patch to SWT broke native rebuild of bindings, all linux build servers stopped building.
	- Performed bisect to find commit that broke SWT 
 	- Investigated the commit. A method was moved from one file to another (C.java to OS.java).
	- This change lead to a change in the sequence of code execution,
	- A native method (setenv) was now being called before the native library was loaded, 
	  leading to an unsatisfied link error.
	- Wrote a quick patch to get compilations to work again. Suggested to revert original patch.
	- Original patch was reverted and modified.

(Finished)
Bug 497923 - Minor improvement to .build.sh.
	- Previously I checked if regular java is installed. This is not that useful on it's own.
	  Modified it so that it checks if java-devel is installed, which has the jni.h
	  header that is required for linking and compilation.

(Finished)
Bug 499577 - Add install_sysdeps.sh to swt.tools 
	- Setting up Fedora for SWT development involves installing multiple devel packages 
	before you can rebuild JNI bindings. The first time I had to do this as an intern,
	it took me 2 days to figure out why the build was failing me and which packages are needed.
	I wrote a script simmilar to JHBuild's 'install sysdeps', which depending on your 
	linux distribution automatically installs the required devel libraries.
	- Currently works on various versions of Fedora (with YUM on F21 and before and DNF after).
	- Left place-holder for other linux distributions
	- Throws warning at user if .classpath is not configured and provides instructions.

(Finished)
Small bits:
- backport Bug 498829 - Load webkit2 so file if webkit 1.x is not available 
- Updated SWT wiki's 'how to backport' section with cherry pick instructions, screenshot of push dialogue and relevant details. 


This week:
 Start on Stage 2 of Webkit Javascript port. Support evaluation of expressions.
