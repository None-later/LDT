User support for SWT. Backport of build.sh to maintenance.

JNI:
- learned about static/instance method callbacks.
- learned about caching of method/field id's.
- Global vs local vs weak global pointers.
- Pushing/popin local frames.


=== Tuesday 01 November ===
Eclipse questions
- Can't debug a system function. (They don't know how to tell appart system function from regular function).
 -> I spent way too much time on this.

JNI:
- Exceptions, catching/throwing.
- Invocation interface. (Used by equinox launcher).

Merged:
Bug 505738 - Define a information hover color which JDT, CDT or others can use

Backport:
Bug 497923 - [GTK] build.sh bugfixes and improvements

------------------- POST WR:

Note for next WR: Color Factory was merged.

Bug 501742 – Default Javadoc text and background color should use colors consistent with Java editor background/foreground. 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=501742

Bug 505851 – [Dark Theme] Style the HOVER_ colors for the dark theme 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=505851

=== Thursday 03 November ===
Eclipse JNI article published:
http://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/11/03/eclipse-for-jni-development-and-debugging-on-linux-java-and-c/

Learned the fine details between char, UTF-8, UTF-16. How they are used and converted between Java, SWT, Gtk and Webkit.

Now have "Author" rights on Red Hat developer blog.

Eclipse camp 

=== Saturday 05 November ===

=== Wed's WR: ===
Highlights:
- Through some volunteer work, University of Toronto now uses Eclipse CDT for their introduction to C/System Programming course. 

Last week:
Most of the time was spent learning about Java Native Interface:
 - Field and Method access **(Callbacks) (javap to generate method signatures...)**
 - Static/instance method calls
 - Caching of method pointers (for performance optimizations)
 - Global vs Local, vs Weak Global reference.
 - Local frames
 - Exceptions, throwing exceptions from C to Java.
 - Invocation interface (This is used by Equinox launcher).
 
Reviews/investigations:
- Bug 497444 : Context iteration caused crash / NPE in other bits of code:
- Bug 503431 - [wayland] CTabFolder slow when switching tabs (DnD logic issue on wayland)

Backports:
- Backport of build script of SWT native libraries (as per user request).

Volunteer work (At home, outside of work hours):
- Guest lecture at UofT on Eclipse for C development (CDT), for about ~200 students.
  http://bit.ly/2fhJAz8
  (~took me 7 hours to prepare presentation over the weekend...)
  Had UofT IT staff install eclipse-CDT spin on their machines.
  Eclipse CDT is now the official IDE for UofT's introductory 'C/System Programming' course, as endorsed by professor.
  > Received followup questions from students who started learning how to use Eclipse CDT. Seems to have had an impact on them.

**Upgraded to to Fedora's Code-Freeze beta. Looking better. Now standby works.**
**Attended SWT weekly meeting (Markus, Sravan etc.. ), disscussed DnD patch from Ian.**

PTOs last week:
- Friday, full day.
- Thursday, half day.

This week:
- Continue/Finish JNI book.
- Continue on Webkit2 evaluate() implementation.
- **Make eclipese demo camp wiki page, advertise.**
