== Weekply report ==
Highlights:
---------
- Webkit2 (in progress): Got Browser.evaluate() to work for a single type (ex boolean) at SWT level.

Last week:
--------
Webkit port:
- Implemented Browser.evaluate() for returning a single type (ex boolean) at the SWT level.
- Now researching how to implement evaluate() such that it can return different types (Strings/Numbers/Booleans/Array of ...).
  -> May either consider returning a custom Struct || Array of pointers || Array of objects.
  -> Researching best approach.

- Wrote relevant jUnit test cases for evaluate() for different return types. (String/Boolean/Number).

- Researched how 'BrowserFunction()' worked. It allows users to register callback from JavaScript back
  to Java. Ex allows events such as clicking on a custom Javascript pie-chart to be handled by Java.
  This old way of registering callbacks broke in Webkit2. 
  Consulted with WebkitGtk community, they suggested alternative Webkit2 API via Script_Message_Handler.
  Next I will have to research that API.

- Now reading a book on JNI to get a better feel for the framework. (Since most of my time these days is spent in JNI).
   E.x to figure out how to best implement polymorphism from C to Java.


Bug 505738 - Define a Documentation hover color which JDT, CDT or others can use
 -> Lars Vogel and Dani Mergert are now OK with using ColorFactory.
	I wrote a generic ColorFactory & preference that can be used by various plugins (not just JDT's Javadoc).
	Awaiting patch review.


Other:
- Started organising Eclipse Demo. Awaiting confirmation about date (Nov 24th) from Eclipse Foundation.

@UofT 
Volunteer work: (Outside of work-hours)
- Attended a workshop at UofT: "Practice interviews for Computer Scientists/Software Engineers" as Interviewer.
   Asked students practice coding questions and provided feedback on their resume.


This week:
----------------
- Webkit port :
   - Try to finish evaluate for multiple types.
   - Start on "Handle Javascript callbacks".

== Other ==
Patch review:
Bug 500086 - Deprecate Composite.changed

=== Thursday 20 October ===
- JNI readings. Conceptual understanding.
 Example, return a string. 
  Allocate string in C. Normally you have to free it. But if you pass it to java, then you don't have to free it, Java will.
- JNI: tied jni.h and sample JNI projects into Eclipse. Allows me to explore JNI types, methods.
- JNI: Cool, a project can be both, Java and C. (Adding a C nature).
