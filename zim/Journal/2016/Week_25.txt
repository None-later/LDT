## This Week:
# Highlights:
- Discussion with GTK developers on how to prepare SWT's architecture to work on GTK 4 & how to address current swt issues with widget z-ordering.

# Details:
GTK+ Hackafest (Joint work with Eric):
- Researched origin of SWT Custom container (SWTFixed) that is causing many sizing issues for swt. 
- found & communicated with developer who implemented SWTFixed, he explained why it was implemented.
- Explained to GTK+ folks our issues with SWT on GTK.
- Discussed with GTK+ folks how we can alter SWT architecture to prepare SWT for GTK. (remove swt_fixed and potentially use GtkOverlay instead because GdkWindow is being removed in GTK4).

JHBuild Research:
- Researched method to build any version of GTK (as oppose to just latest). (Was given advise on Gtk+ irc channel)
- This is for bisecting GTK sources to see which patch broke SWT behaviour.
- Setup JHBuild for Ian and showed him how to compile GTK. (He bisected GTK it to find out which patch broke SWT fonts in GTK 3.22)

(In Progress)
Bug 489025 – [gtk3] Task list does show task icon,
- Found that issue does not occur on older Eclipse builds, (mars etc..)
- Found that child eclipse fails to launch with older SWT libraries (older than 2- months), so it was hard to figure out which patch broke things.
- Investigated how child Eclipse loads older SWT '.so' library bindings (~/.swt/lib/linux/x86_64), so that I could launch child eclipse with very old SWT code base.
- bisected SWT code base, found a ~7 months old path that (while fixing icons for multiple columns) affects mylyn's use of icons.

Monday & Tuesday -> Trip to Raleigh office for orientation. 
(Bought back some fedora stickers for my laptop).


## Next Week:
Bug 489025 – [gtk3] Task list does show task icon,
- Investigate how to alter original patch to fix mylyn icons but also support icons on multiple columns.

=== Wednesday 22 June — Post WR: ===
