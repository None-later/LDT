===== Weekly report: =====
Weekly report:

Highlights:
###########
- No major commits. Mostly small bits and work-in-progress on Wayland.

Last Week:
##########

Webkit2 port:
- (IN PROGRESS) Browser.evaluate()
   Got preliminary array support working, (patch in progress)
   This includes nested arrays inside arrays.
   Needs further testing and I need to write/submit jUnit tests.
   Eta: This week.
- (IN PROGRESS) Browser.function:
   In a native C snippet, got Javascript to callback C.
   Investigated how to port functionality into SWT.
   I see no road blocks at the moment. I just need to spend time on it.
   Eta: 1-(3?) Weeks


Color fixes:
- Bug 507298 – Heap Status progress had inverted colors
  - Fixed incorrect usage of TOOL_TIP (MERGED)
  - Fixed setBackground bug and added theaming for dark theme. (IN REVIEW)

- Bug 508498 – Add api to replace COLOR_INFO_* with a 'getInformationColor*()
   method that will provide COLOR_LIST_ on Linux, COLOR_INFO_ on Win32/Cocoa.
   This is to be used to replace 'COLOR_INFO_' default references in JFace.
   Note:
	- Higher level theamable widgets (e.g javadoc/etc...) can override with their
	  own colors.
	- COLOR_LIST_* works well on Gtk3 system themes. COLOR_LIST is dark on dark
	  theme, and bright on bright theme.

- Bug 507073 - Use fitting colors for Content assist's additional info pane
   - Investigated inverted color issue in some dialogues in content assist.
	 ex: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=265206
	 Fix depends on merge of #508498 (info color api)

- Bug 508776 - Javadoc hover shows mix of Info and Javadoc colors
  - Strip at the bottom of a Javadoc received colors from HOVER/INFO colors,
	this could lead to inconsistent looks if user specified
	different JAVADOC and INFO colors.
	Ex: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=265756
	Submitted a set of preliminary fixes in JFace and JavaDocHover to address
	the issue. (In Review)


Other:
- Bug 508768: Removed deprecated pocketPC snippets/HTML links
- Testing: Alex's shell size path for Wayland. #508692. Patch is good!
- Triage:  Bug 508916 – content-assist window causes freeze

- Wrote python script to followup on Bugzilla snippets on/after a particular day.
  * Eg: If I write "followup:2016-12-13" into bugzilla's "Whiteboard" field,
	then later with my script I can list out bugs that need followup from
	the command line, or open them in tabs in Firefox.
  * Uses Red Hat's 'Bugzilla query' python framework.
  * Used Eclipse Pydev :-).
  * I might write a blog entry on "how to query Bugzilla programtically"
  * Script:
   https://github.com/LeoUfimtsev/python-eclipse-bugzilla-query/blob/master/bugzilla_open_followup.py

Next Week:
##########
Webkit:
- Finish Browser.evaluate() array support
- Work on Browser.function() implementation
