- completed code of conduct training.
- Win32 - Browser new test case fails on win32: test_evaluate_invalid_return_value

Linus uses fedora:
"For the last 10 years, probably since I switched away from Power PC, I
think I've used Fedora. Right now most of the machines (wife's and
kids') are Fedora 23, a couple of them have been updated to 24, but
then I will install my own kernel. One of the reason I like Fedora is
they tend to be fairly good about new kernels. Red Hat, in general, has
been very good about kernel resources. They have been helpful in
testing, and, obviously, they do have a lot of kernel engineers. One of
the reasons I ended up going with Fedora was that they did a good job on
the side that I cared about."

=== Tuesday 22 November ===
- Bug 505591 - Add test cases for Browser.evaluate() to browser test suite.
 -> on windows, returns null.
