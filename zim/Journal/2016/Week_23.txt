Last Week:
(Completed)
Bug 487757 - ScrolledComposite is empty if it is hidden and then made visible via setVisible(true|false) 
	- Traced / learned how SWT deals with initial sizing/layout of widgets 
	- Found that gtk3.8+ doesn't size hidden widgets properly (thank you Eric for pointing out Gtk3.8+ release notes).
	- Found in SWT, if setVisible() is called before widget is first layout/shown, widget is not shown correctly 
	- Wrote a fix for it in Composite
	- Wrote a jUnit test case that fails before the fix and passes after the fix, to avoid future regression. 
	   (In general, from now on I will try to submit a jUnit test case for every bugfix, it's good pracitce).

(Starting)
Bug 489025 – [gtk3] Task list does show task icon, categories labels overlap incoming marker
	- MyLyn is missing task icons and other GUI cheese
	- Configured mylyn for SWT Bug tracking on my machine 
	- Reproduced issue, investigating cause. It seems in Gtk3, TreeView has troubles drawing more than 2 icons next to an entry.
