Weekly report:
Last Week:

Investigating black background issue with JavaDoc hoverbox and view (Bug 500196)
 - Found locations in platform.ui that define the color
 - Issue is caused by JavaDoc using 'tooltip' as colour, but tooltip is black on gnome3
 - Investigating how to fix. Fix is not straight forward. Simply using a different system 
  	colour leads to issues with black-theme

Investigated DnD parts not drawing rectangle of where part 'should go' (Bug 498217)
 - Tried to manually revert Gtk commit from 3 years ago, but it did not fix the issue 
 	in newest GTK+ version.
 - Postponed work on this patch till more urgent webkit2 and Wayland ports are complete.

Refactored Stefan.X's commit.
  - It used 'instance of', which can make future debugging difficult.
	Refactored code to use polymorphism instead. (Decoupling principle).

Community:
* Joined Eclipse Status Meeting (Lars, Arun, Sravan, Markus etc...)
* 500924: [GTK] Applications using eclipse swt crash when disposing widgets 
 - Investigated user reported issue. Inspected dispose mechanism of Widget and Control.
 - Not reproducible with general snippets. Seems to be specific to user's system.
* Helped Ian with various issues.
