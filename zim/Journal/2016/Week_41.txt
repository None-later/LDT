This week:
----------

(Port in progress)
Webkit2 port:
- Currently working on evaluate() implementation for webkit2.
- Wrote jUnit test case for evaluate() (Bug 505591)
- Researched/traced how evaluate() currently works on Webkit1/Mozilla.
   Found that a JavaScriptCore callback is not triggered on Webkit2.
   Disscussed with Gtk community, instead of fixing old callback (in java),
   I will implement a new one in native code (webkitgtk_custom.c) via webkit_*_run_javascript().
- Refactored/Documented Browser Suite.
	Fixed browser only taking up half the shell.
	Broke test case on windows (fault lied in windows implementation of browser).
	Submitted patch that treats browser testing slightly different on windows.

(Discussion in progress)
Bug 505738 - Define a Documentation hover color which JDT, CDT or others can use
 - Lars Vogel opposes ColorFactory in Platform. Suggests hard-coding / moving factory into JDT.
   But hard-coding breaks themes and the factory is needed by other plugins (e.g CDT).
 - Dani Mergert opposes using single color (COLOR_LIST_*).
	I.e, there is conflict among platform.ui contributors.
	Trying to find a solution to make everyone happy.
	-> Lengthy discussion in progress.

(Merged)
Bug 501868 - In copy details please add ID and Summary
- Refactored class (as per suggestion from MyLyn contributors)
- Fixed test cases that I broke.
- My patch was merged.

Monday - Thanks givings.


Backports:
- Bug 497812 - requestLayout not layout correctly
- There was a request from a user to backport to 4.3, but after discussion, it turned out that backporting so far is very time consuming. Proposed to user to use 4.6 instead.

Documentation:
- Backporting to versions older than n-1:
  https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT/Devel/Workflow#Note_about_backporting_to_versions_earlier_than_n-1

Blog:
- How to use X11 backend on Wayland: (On Fedora 25)
https://coffeeorientedprogramming.com/2016/10/06/make-applications-eclipse-use-x11-backend-on-wayland-fedora-25/

Other:
- My mac currently freezes on Fedora 25 with Wayland (after 5 mins). Had to switch to X11 for now. But on the bright side it now shuts down and goes to sleep. I can still work in VM on wayland issues.

Next:
Continue on Webkit2 port, implement evaluate(). (this might take a while)

== Other work ==
Bug 505591 - Add test case for Browser.evaluate() to browser test suite. 
 - added test two test cases for evaluate. (return a Number and return a Boolean)
