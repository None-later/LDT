(In progress)
Bug 441568 â€“ [GTK3][webkit] Port SWT Browser to webkit2gtk: 
 - WebKit2 currently doesn't execute javascript via browser.execute(..),
 - In WebKit2, JS execution requires compiliation and use of a webextension.
 - Sami started a patch, investigating what Sami did so far, how webextensions work. 
 - Last week I've spent time getting aquainted with WebKit, WebKitGTK+ and
 	how SWT interacts with WebKitGTK+.
 	I looked over broken webkit jUnit test cases, looked into why they are failing. 
 	Learned about SWT Browser Widget, how it works and how it's implemented.


SWT Planning: https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT/Plan/4.7 
 - Got SWT community involved. SWT community embraced the idea, 
	people like Lars Vogel added some plans (ex lamda event listeners).
	I will keep track of the page and try to update it once every 2 weeks or so.

SWT Bugzilla Triage
 - Spring clean up of my old bugs, closed a whole bunch.
 - Investigated missing icons on mylyn queries: Bug 497352 - [GTK3][mylyn] Queries are missing icons
 - other.

Patch review:
 - For Alex's submission: Bug 497122 - org.eclipse.swt.tests.junit.browser.Browser6 crashes with Webkit2 

Platform.UI
 - Researched relevant Platform.UI jUnit tests for SWT developers. (SWT can break platform.UI) 
 - Researched which jUnit test cases fail on GTK2/GTK3 for Platform UI and JFace. (~11 fail at present)
 - Submitted parent + subtasks to keep track: Bug 497330: [Gtk3] Platform.ui test failures on Gtk
 - Documented in SWT Wiki how to get Platform.UI testing to work & which tests to run:
 	https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT/Devel/Gtk/platformTests
 - When I have time, I'll do some more work on fixing those up.


 This Week:
 - Continue with WebKit Port. (This project will probably span out over a number of weeks)
