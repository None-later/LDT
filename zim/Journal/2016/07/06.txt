- Setup Gtk snippet with JHBuild as reference 
- Learned about how SWT loads external libraries (Library.java) (Webkit2 loads new library (webextension) for javascript execution) 
- Read over Sami's patch. It's ~1200 lines of very complex code, written over the course of several months.
	- Compiles webextension seperate from WebKit for Javascript execution
	- DBus to communicate with module 
	- Hashmap to keep track of callbacks
	- etc.. very high complexity
	
- Read over GObject documentation (GTK+ dynamic type/object framework)
