Webkit
- Bug 525340 – [Gtk][Webkit2] Javascript evaluate fails with "SyntaxError: Return statements are only valid inside functions"
   * Fixed SWT/webkit2 bug that caused a regression in jboss welcome screen.
   * Occured because I originally didn't forsee a corner case in how javascript
	 would have been passed to SWT. Fix was fairly simple.
   * Added jUnit to catch such corner cases in the future.
- Bug 522733 – Crash on close with webkitgtk 2.18
   * With Webkitgtk 2.18, when JVM quits, webkit crashes.
   * It seem that webview is dereference multiple times in an 'on_exit' handler
   * Investigating root casue & fix. (complicated...)

Other
