09 July to 15 July

====== Observations and Life Lessons ======

====== Weekly Goals ======

====== Weekly Report ======
Highlights:
- Reviewing old SWT patch submissions.
  E.g Found a good patch that fixes highest voted SWT-linux bug, which was forgotten in time.
  Currently working with author to revive/merge patch.
- Investigated (SWT) Maven jUnit test breakage, problem was that it was pulling 4.7 swt instead of 4.8.


Last Week:
##########
Maven:
  Bug 519616 – Test failures in SWT gerrit jobs
   - Investigated maven build failures in SWT tests. Maven spontaneously started failing some jUnits.
   - Failures only occurred on Maven. Tests worked locally.
   - After investigation, I found that maven was using new jUnits and testing against older SWT code base
	 (4.8 jUnits, 4.7 SWT).
   - Sravan patched the releng update site to point to 4.8 and tests pass again.

  - Cross-Platform Test Servers:
	Bug 519583 – [Win32][Maven] Running swt jUnits via maven fails due to wrong environment being picked up in features.xml
	- Investigated why Maven jUnit tests were not running on windows 10.
	- Found that on Windows, platform/environment was not identified correctly,
	  (it thinks that jUnits are gtk on windows)
	  If I hard-code Win/x64, then tests pass.
	- Researching how to fix environment issue. (in progress)

Patch Reviews:
Bug 61190 Shortcut keys doesn't work with non-English keyboard (e.g Russian)
 - Keyboard shortcuts like ctrl+s, c,x,v don't work on non-english layouts like Russian.
   Patch originally submitted in 2014, but was forgotten in time.
 - I did an extensive review/testing of submitted patch.
 - Patch is good, just needed some polish. (fix a memory leak etc...)
 - Will probably merge this week.
 - Currently highest voted swt-linux bug

Bug 508600 – [API] The average character width of a font is not integer
  - Review took a while as patch introduced floating point comparison, which can be prone to subtle errors.
  - Researched dangers of using floating point on java.

Investigation/Triage:
Bug 519439 – editor doesn't get focus after double click from package explorer
 - Investigated bug report. (related to work I've done earlier)
 - Doesn't reproduce on my system. Asked for more info.

Other:
Bug 519328 – [All] Add "Bug Snippets" folder to org.eclipse.swt.tests project
 - Added "bug snippets" folder to our test project. Here we can put
   snippet to reproduce issues that occur on all platforms.
   Useful to verify bugfixes for situations where it's not possible to add a jUnit.

Bug 519570 – [gtk] fix .project of org.eclipse.swt.tests.feature

Upgraded to Fedora 26. Had some issues with shutdown/hibernation on my Mac,
  installed a custom kernel to get that to work again.
  Otherwise, F26 works well for me.


This week:
##########
- Fix maven classpath issue on Windows, such that maven can be used on all platforms
  for automated SWT tests.
- Continue review of old SWT patches, revive them as needed.
