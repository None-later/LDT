====== Weekly report ======
Highlights:
###########
- Introducing new(ish) way to triage bugs in SWT (& potentially platform): https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT/Devel/Triage

Last Week:
##########

Bug 465280 – [GTK3] OS.gtk_widget_get_allocation returns (0,0) for invisible controls
- Working on fix (in progress)
- This takes a while as this fix touches sizing of every SWT widget.
- Reading/debugging over GTK sources to understand what's under the hood etc..

- Introduced new(ish) way to triage bugs in SWT (& potentially platform)
  - Current triage methods used in SWT/Platform had issues:
	* When bugs were triaged, they were re-assigned from platform-swt-inbox to platform-triaged.
	  However, many developers don't monitor traged-* user(s), so bugs were left unattended. 
	* In Platform, when a bug was triaged, it was marked as "ASSIGNED", but this was ambigious as
	  no one actually worked on the bugs.
	* Instead, I suggested to ditch "triaged-*" user and not change status, but add "Triaged" keyword.
  - Documented new proces https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT/Devel/Triage
  - There are ~130 Linux bugs assigned to swt-triaged at the moment. Me/Eric will go through them this/next week.
