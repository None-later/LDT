Highlights:
###########
- Bug 510538 - [GTK] Add Callback constructor for custom method signatures
  (Was needed for Ian's gesture patch).

Last Week:
##########
- Bug 510538 - [GTK] Add Callback constructor for custom method signatures [0->100%]
  - Investigated why Ian's gesture callback was providing garbage data.
  - Found the issue to be inconsistent method signature in JNI callback mechanism,
	(arguments were not shifted correctly if method signature was inconsistent).
  - To solve the problem, Ian's gesture patch required a callback mechanism with
	a custom method signature.
  - Implemented a mechanism that converts a java signature into a JNI equivalent one.
  - This took several iterations. (Version 1, version2, version3..) until an
	efficent and elegant solution was merged.

- Bug 508217 - [GTK3][Webkit] Implement webkit2 support for browser function [30->90%]
  - Implemented mechanism to register javascript to java callback.
  - Implemented logit to link callback to correct Java instance function.
	 (this took a long time...)

Testing/Patch review:
- Bug 510647 - Non-resizable Shells open with wrong size (200x200)
  - Tested issue against old gtk builds.
  - Compiled ancient Gtk3.04 for testing. Took a bit longer due to missing legacy libraries.

Triage:
- Bug 466515 - [GTK3] Tool item buttons switch to whiter background if dialogue is opened
- Bug 510183 - [Webkit2] Internal browser hangs in WebKitGTK._swtWebkitEvaluateJavascript()
  - Investigated freeze up in Javadoc hover on webkit2.
  - Cause due to mix of deprecated Webkit1 mechanism being used in webkit2.
  - Turned off redundant functions on webkit2 for time being.
- Bug 509411 - [Webkit 1] Crash during Test_*_Browser evaluate() tests
  - New Browser.evaluate() tests were causing webkit1 crashes. Investigated and
	turned off some on webkit1 for time being.
