====== Week 27 2017 ======
02 July to 08 July

====== Observations and Life Lessons ======
- SWT Nebula has quite an active user base, lots of commits. 

====== Weekly Goals ======
[70% -> 80%] Setup automated Windows/OSX/LinuxGtk2/LinuxGt3/LinuxWayland test servers for gerrit patch submissions
[x] Dark theme hyper-link text is dark blue on black background in Javadoc 
[x] Investigate outstanding Webkit2 work
[60->70% ] Complete update of SWT Triage process 

====== Weekly Report ======

Webkit:
Bug 514719 – [Browser][Webkit2] port Browser.getText() to webkit2 
 - Updated jUnits to reflect different behaviour on windows
 - a few Browser tests timeout too soon on OSX when started from maven. Increased timeout interval
Bug 519177 – [All] update Browser.getText() javadoc to reflect platform specific behavior of returned html (ex Windows) 
Bug 518961 – [Gtk][Browser] Using Nebula's Rich Text Editor Launchs exception on Linux OS
- Investigated. Nebula (SWT extension) RichTextEditor only fails on Webkit1/Webkit2 Linux.
  Not on Cocoa/Win32.
  Seems some javascript triggers exception only on webkit1/webkit2.
  Requested Nebula maintainers to narrow down to javascript snippet,
  (or I will do later if time permits):
  ReportedBug 519333 – Regression after (Bug 498392 Create a more general configuration design), on Linux Webkit1,2 
  Bug 519340 – org.eclipse.nebula.widgets.richtext.example doesn't launch on Cocoa due to java 1.7 


SWT jUnit/Test related:
Bug 518379 – Allow platform specific JUnit tests 
 - gtk only junit test package activated on cocoa, which it shouldn't.
 - The reason was that Cocoa is a 'unix' family and gtk tests were marked to run only on unix family.
 - Solution was to narrow Gtk tests to "Linux" OS name.
 - Tested on Cocoa/Fedora/CentOS/Ubuntu.
Bug 519237 – [Cocoa] mvn -Pbuild-individual-bundles fails on OSX due to missing -XstartOnFirstThread vm arg 
  - "Maven build fails on OSX. Added conditional argument to pom.xml, such that on OSX arg is added"
 Bug 470174 – Improvement main thread warning message on macosx 
  - Made error message include the solution, as oppose to just print a complaint. 
	Solution is to add a vm arg that is specific to java on osx"
Bug 519328 – [All] Add "Bug Snippets" folder to org.eclipse.swt.tests project 
 - "Adding bug snippets to swt, to make it easier to reproduce bug reports"
