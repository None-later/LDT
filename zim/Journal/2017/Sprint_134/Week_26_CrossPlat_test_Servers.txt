Highlights:

- n/a. Work in progress.

Last Week:
##########
(0 -> 65%)
Set up servers (Win32/Cocoa/linux) for automated cross-platform testing of SWT gerrit submissions.
- Set up OSX and Win32 vm, Linux vm
- Set up ability remote into those. (RDP for windows, VNC for mac/linux) (So Eric/Ian can remote into them)
- Set up ability to ssh into Mac, Windows & linux. 
  (Windows now has a build in bash prompt. But getting ssh to work was tricky)
- Setup Maven on Linux, to run tests from command line
- Configured machines for Eclipse/SWT development 
- I had some trouble with my workflow. In the past I used mylyn/gerrit, but
  as of gerrit 2.13, mylyn gerrit integration broke down (bug 485981). So I've reverted to
  using command line again.
- Fair bit of time was spent on researching bash/ssh on Windows.
Todo:
- Set up maven on OSX, Win32.
- Write script to ssh into test servers, trigger gerrit checkouts and run maven.

Patches:
Bug 506030 – [GTK] clean up dynamic function calls 
 - Code hygiene: moved usercomments out of javadoc that is parsed by SWT
