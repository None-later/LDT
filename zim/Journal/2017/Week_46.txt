====== Weekly Report ======

Note:
People keep talking more and more about wayland. We should improve wayland support.

Highlights:
########
BrowserFunction working. All jUnits pass (including return value back to javascript), snippets work. Stable/working/safe.
The patch still needs some polish thou, and I need to break it up into smaller sub-patches. (currently ~2200 lines long). (Next week?)

Last Week:
#########
- Webkit2: BrowserFunction
  * The implementation is working quite well. There are a few tasks left to polish the patch thou. (Next week?)
  * All jUnits, SWT BrowserFunction snippet & child eclipse work with patch.
  * Implemented the following:
	 ~ Linked callback from Javascript to user's Java function.
	 ~ Converted user's Java type to GVariant, sent over GDBus and converted back.
	 ~ Added verification of user data (Javascript and Java side) to prevent breaking gdb connection.
	 ~ Ensured resources are freed properly.
  * Ran into surprises:
	 ~ GDBus doesn't handle (pure) 'null' values or empty arrays. Had to research & implement magic numbers to deal with them. (cost = 2/3 days).
	 ~ Bad user data can break gdbus connection. Had to implement recursive user input verification. (cost 1/2 days).
  * Outstanding work:
	 ~ Need to implement lazy-loading of gdbus connection. Only initialize it if BrowserFunction is actually used as gdbus init is expensive (but done only once per process).
	 ~ Need to implement mechanism to put webkit-extension.so into a seprate folder, otherwise we get console warning. (@Need to ask Alex.k)

This Week:
#########
Finish polishing of BrowserFunction patch. Break it up into sub-patches and look into merging it.
