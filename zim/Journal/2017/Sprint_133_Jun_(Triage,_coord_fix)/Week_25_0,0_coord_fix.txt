====== Week 25 2017 ======
18 June to 24 June

====== Observations and Life Lessons ======

====== Weekly Goals ======
[*] Fix Coord issue.  2017-06Jun-26Mon.
[ ] Dark theme hyper-link text is dark blue on black background in Javadoc.
[*] Fix Stack overflow issue in perspectives.

====== Weekly Report ======
Highlights:
###########
- Fixed highest voted critical bug in SWT/Linux: 
   Unhandled event loop > StackOverflow in Perspective  (Infnite recusion) 
   & OS.gtk_widget_get_allocation returns (0,0) for invisible controls 
  This improves EclipseGtk3 performance on Fedora and makes Eclipse Gtk3 usable on Ubuntu.

- SWT Noteworthy: Lakshmi removed XUL/Mozilla backend from SWT

Last Week:
##########
- Resolved Infinite recursion issue: (review in progress)
   #1 Bug 497705 – Unhandled event loop > StackOverflow in Perspective
	  which in turn was caused by:
   #2 Bug 465280 – [GTK3] OS.gtk_widget_get_allocation returns (0,0) for invisible controls
   * On Fedora, Eclipse/Gtk3 had performance issues as infinite recusion occured, but JVM did not crash.
   * On Ubuntu, Eclipse/Gtk3 was not usable at all due to a stack overflow. (Now Elipse is usable).
   * The fix was actually fixing a workaround that had a typo. But it took a long
	 time to find this as I had to understand how visibility works internally in GTK.
   * This was the highest voted critical Linux bug in SWT. I started work on it due to
	 large number of complaints by users about this issue.

 - Reviewed Eric's 1700+ color patch. ~It took a day and a half.
   Very good patch, looking forward to having it merged!

 - Submitted Eclipse con talk proposal for my own talk:
	JNI in Eclipse, where C and Java mix and mingle
   Also Eric and I submitted a joint tutorial:
	Building Meaningful Applications in SWT for Beginners
   (for tutorials, both presenters get a free pass)

- Other bits:
 Bug 516674 – Regression in Oxygen of Control.forceFocus() on CentOS 
 - Investigation test failure that only occurs on CentOS.
 Bug 518379 – Allow platform specific JUnit tests 
  - Added platform .java stubs, updated pom files. Merged
 Bug 518478 – SWT project should use "Triaged" keyword instead of assigning to swt-triaged@eclipse.org user. 
  - Updated eclips.org swt website to point to new triage process
  - Steadily moving bugs away from old swt-triaged@ user.

- Patch reviews:
   Bug 486068 – [GTK3.20+] Allocation warnings printed in error console 
   Bug 502264 – Event class should override clone() 
	- User submitte patch to make Events Clonable. Whlie its a great idea, the trivial implementation only created a shallow copy, which is not a true copy, thus it had too much potential for bugs

   Bug 506030 – [GTK] clean up dynamic function calls 
	- SWT JNI methods javadoc should not contain usercomments

- Emphasis on being responsive to user submissions. Ensured all submissons
  were responded to.
