====== Week 20 2017 ======
14 May to 20 May

====== Observations and Life Lessons ======
- Spending too much time on little things.
- I should set day goals. Work to get those day goals done first. Then screw around.
- I should focus on full-filling weekly goals. (maybe Monthly)?)

====== Weekly Goals ======
[*] getText()
[x] SWT Manual Tests.

====== Weekly Report ======

Highlights:
###########
- n/a

Last Week:
##########

-[in progress] Webkit2: getText() api
  - Experimenting with different aproaches. (javascript save html, webkit_save, webkit_save resource)
  - webkit_save_() produces an mhtml, which is not the same as the original html.
  - investigating save_resource method instead.

- (Me/Ian) Eclipse team presentation for interns

- Helped new intern setup his workstation, get him started.

Patch review & investigation:
- Bug 515773 – [wayland] Text widget not able to grab focus with SWT.ON_TOP shell 

Gmail:
- Reconfigured my inbox completley. 
- Deleted old folder structure/filters
- Instead of filtering emails into 'folders', I now only apply labels and most
  email is kept inside one of the inboxes (primary, updates etc..)
- I now archive or 'mute' conversations instead of marking them as read.
- This allows me to respond to relevant bugzilla/emails quicker & keep email traffic under control.

Next Week:
##########
- Webkit2: getText() api
-
