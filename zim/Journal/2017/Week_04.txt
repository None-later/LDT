Highlights:
###########
- Webkit2: Completed (part 1) of browser function. # 508217
- Found/implemented a solution to evaluate() hang/freeze issue. # 510183

This Week:
##########
Webkit2 port:
- Completed (part 1) of browser function. # 508217
  * This covers most use cases for browser.function()
  * Users can register custom javascript function and triggering them leads
	  to the correct java callback. Arguments are correctly passed along.
  * Only functionality that isn't supported is for the java callback to 
	  return a value back to javascript. This is because Webkit2's api is async
	  and doesn't support a return value for that callback. 
	  Implementing this would require a custom webextension.
  * This fixes a bunch of jUnits test cases.

- Found/implemented a solution to evaluate() hang/freeze issue. # 510183
  * There was a corner case in Browser.evluate() that caused a deadlock.
	(If a signal from javascript triggered an SWT event which calls evaluate() 
	while webkit2 is doing something (ex page loading), then evaluate is
	not ran because it's waiting for webkit signal to be processed first.
	But signal is not finishing because evaluate is being ran).
	Solution was to post-pone SWT event's that were initiated by webkit2 signals
	via asyncExe(), to allow webkit2 signals to finish before SWT events get triggered.
  * This also fixes  *510694: [Webkit2] Implement 'close' for webkit2)

Found/investigated new webkit2 troubles:
- Bug 510972 [Gtk3][Webkit2] Port webkit_window_object_cleared to webkit2.
- Bug 511228 [Webkit2] Ensure proper settings are used for webkit2.
I will work on those. (these are not as big thou, should take less time).


Next Week:
##########
- Continue with fixing various webkit2 bits. (jUnits, port settings/signals)
