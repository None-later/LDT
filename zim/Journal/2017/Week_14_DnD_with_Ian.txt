====== Week 14 DnD with Ian ======
02 April to 08 April

Weekly report.

Highlights:
###########
- Spent most of the week with Ian designing a DnD architecture, such that we have backwards support
  for external custom widgets (StyledText/CTabFolder etc..) without having to modify them.
  This is to be compatible with OSX & Windows and not breaking custom widgets.
  This involved manually managing outgoing SWT events (SWT.MouseDown, SWT.MouseMove etc.. ).
  Ian's initial patch (still in review), fixes DnD for StyledText (& other custom widgets) on Wayland.

This week:
##########
SWT:
- DnD Architecture (see above)

Webkit2:
- 514719 port Browser.getText() api to webkit2 
  - User reported getText() api does not work on Webkit2.
  - After investigation, turns out I missed this api, it has not been ported from Webkit1 to Webkit2.
  - Will need to implement Webkit2 equivalent. 
  - Wrote preliminary jUnit tests for API.

SWT Tooling:
- [Awaiting review] Wrote/upstreamed my build script that rebuilds swt bindings with debug support,
  (to be able to debug SWT jni glue code), it automatically fixes common issues 
  and automates a series of everyday steps #514509
- Fixed PPC64 build.sh's method of finding JAVA_PATH. Finding it dynamically instead of hard-coding it. #512224

Triage:
- [platform-swt-dev] WebKit.java (GTK) does not compile
- [platform-swt-dev] swt for other programming languages
- Bug 514711 â€“ [GTK3] SWT errors and event loop exeptions by switching Tabs 

GUI news:
- Ubuntu is ditching Unity GUI and is now switching to Gnome (with potential Wayland in the future).
  I.e, now Ubuntu developers will probably be more interested in Eclipse on Wayland work.

Next Week:
##########
- DND: Review DnD patch for custom widgets
- Webkit2: Implement getTet() api
