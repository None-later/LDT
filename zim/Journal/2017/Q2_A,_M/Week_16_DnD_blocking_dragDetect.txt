====== Week 16 2017 ======
16 April to 22 April

====== Observations and Life Lessons ======

====== Weekly Plan ======
[*] Implement barebones DnD move-move wait in DragDetect logic
[x] Maybe start on the getText() webkit2 api.

====== Weekly Report ======
Highlights:
###########
- Implemented proof-of-concept DnD patch that should reduce regressions on Wayland. To be implemented after Oxygen release.
- Engaged with new SWT developer, helped him to get started, encourage him to fix build script instead of disabling test cases.
- Engaged with testing Market Place client patches and Shelled patches.

Last Week:
##########
## SWT
DND:
- Investigated DnD mechanism with smoother backwards support for custom widgets.
  - This would replicate 'blocking' behaviour in dragDetect,
	simmilar to current Gtk2/Gtk3/Windows/OSX behaviour, which in turn
	should reduce regressions.
  - Implemented proof of concept. To be implemented after Oxygen release.
  - For now, we will use a mechanism where we manually manage outgoing SWT.Mouse* events.
  -> merged "StyledText DnD" patch.

- merged patch that get's DnD to work for custom widgets on Wayland, (Could have regressions as it's invasive)
- Implemented proof-of-concept with better backwards support. (To be implemented after Oxygen is released).

Webkit:
- [Webkit1] test_BrowserSuite.testBrowser1() consistently crashes on RHEL6
  - buggy jUnit test case logic. I will improve the test case this/next week
	to stop it from crashing.

Build scripts:
- Added support to use buildscript to build older SWT code base. This is useful
  when bisecting swt codebase for problems.

Patch reviews:
  - Reviewed Ian's GtkEntry patch

User support / Triage:
- A new (but experienced) SWT developer joined the community **"Martin Oberhuber"**, helped him getting started.
- Bug 515486 - Provide a consistent mechanism to disable tests that are unstable or depend on specific external infrastructure
  - User wants to disable some tests. I did not like that idea.
	I suggested to use AllNonBrowserTests and investigate failing junits.
  - User submitted Gtk2 patch that fixed broken jUnits on his machine instead. -> Bug resolved.

## Non-SWT:
Shelled:
- Bug 515478 - "Configure -> Add shell script support" adds 'buildcommand' to .project without need
- Bug 515480 - Add dltk nature to SWT projects for shelled support

MarketPlace Client:
- Tested Mickael's Project nature patch:
  Bug 515511 - [MPC] Propose solutions for missing natures not working for Shelled?
  - We wound that shelled project page was missing nature tags, so MPC could not find that it
	was needed for shelled nature.
  - But even with tag, still doesn't quite work. Needs further investigation.

My hardware:
- Spent some time getting my machine to work better on Wayland. (getting utility applications to work etc..)
- My computer stopped booting with kernel 4.10. Ended up installing kernel from F27 rawhide.

Next Week:
##########
- Review Ian's Launchbar fix
- Fix webkit's test_BrowserSuite.testBrowser1()
- Fix a few colour related problems in Eclipse
- If time permits: [Webkit2] port Browser.getText() to webkit2

Test Mickael's Project nature patch:
Bug 515511 - [MPC] Propose solutions for missing natures not working for Shelled?
- Had troubles with Shelled.

Getting my system to work better on Wayland
- Had issues with some of my utility applications (e.g template application autokey-gtk)
- Found many apps would work ok with "export GDK_BACKEND=x11" or if I installed them with a specific bundled java version. 

Triage:
