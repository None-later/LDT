	Look at other projects, copy the best.
	avoid Adjectives or hyperboles
	**short**
 - Refine the value proposition
	watch for immidiate / emotional response.
	**stick with it.** (takes time to settle).
 - Stick with existing concepts. 

2) Obsess on "First" Experience
	- Many first's (first use, first contribution..)
	- Sweat README.md
		clear value proposition
		how to experience our project (don't assume build)

3) Broadcast. Then Amplify
	- Growth hacking.
	- Slowly grow community
		Observe growth/time. (e.g see what impact your marketing has over weeks/events).
	- Try various experiments, see what grows better.
	
	Start with differentiated content.

	Know your goal
		Engagement
