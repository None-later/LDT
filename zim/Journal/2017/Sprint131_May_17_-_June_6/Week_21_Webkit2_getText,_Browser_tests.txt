====== Week 21 2017 ======
21 May to 27 May

====== Observations and Life Lessons ======
- Make daily goals. They help you.
- Plan time? I need to try this.
- Focus on what's important.

====== Weekly Report ======
Highlights:
###########
- Finished porting Webkit getText() api to webkit2, added jUnits for this api. #514719

Last Week:
##########
- (In Progress) 
  Bug 517264 – Refactor old Browser* tests into Test_*_Browser 
	* Currently we have 8 'old' Browser tests. 
	* These are sometimes unreliable and run very slowly.
	  (For example some wait on a fixed timeout instead of waiting for a condition).
	* Further, each test case tests multiple things at once, making it hard to
	  tell what's broken when something is borken. And they're hard to read.
	* Because of that, developers often skip them.
	* I'm refactoring & improving them. I expect this to take around 2-5 days.

Some triage on new bugs.

This Week:
##########
- Try to Finish : Bug 517264 – Refactor old Browser* tests into Test_*_Browser
- Review Browser api for Webkit2, see if there's any api that I missed in the port
  (other than known return value for BrowserFunction)
