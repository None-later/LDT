- Bug 513938 - [gtk3] "SWTError: No more callbacks" causes tons of NPEs in various test suites since I20170315-2000
	- Fixed memory leaks in SWT caused by recent patch.
	- Widget DragSource was created with an instance callback, but was never disposed.
	- Re-implemented a callback to link to a gtk function (gtk_false) instead.
