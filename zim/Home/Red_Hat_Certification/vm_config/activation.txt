Leo note:
- Employee subscription seems to work.

You can get a zero cost developer subscription at

I just use the regular employee sub, like so:
subscription-manager register
subscription-manager attach pool=8a85f9833e1404a9013e3cddf95a0599
subscription-manager repos disable=*
I then use subscription-manager repos enable= to attach the repos I want to use.
