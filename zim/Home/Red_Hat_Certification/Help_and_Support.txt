====== Summary 2018 ======
This Mojo page is intended to describe the various methods available to employees to take a Red Hat Training course:

https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-181005

To summarize:

1. Self-paced online via Red Hat Learning Subscription:
Follow Instructions here: https://learning.redhat.com/course/view.php?id=899
(I've just updated the above Mojo page to make this process more clear. The login page at https://role.rhu.redhat.com/rol-rhu/rhz/login requires an initial registration before you can access)

2. Instructor-led, delivered internally by Red Hat University:
Search via the Learning Management System for Associates: http://learning.redhat.com
View the calendar by category and region: http://file.rdu.redhat.com/rhu/platforms/lmscalendar

3. Instructor-led, delivered externally by Red Hat Training:
Special URL for Red Hat employees: https://training-lms.redhat.com/Saml/AuthRequest?sitename=redhatint
[This URL seems to be the current source of confusion, as it has stopped working. We're investigating this now.]

A final note: wherever possible, employees should always be taking Red Hat Training classes and exams via internal resources. Externally delivered classes and exams taken at partner testing centers should only be a last resort. Customers will always take precedence in external classrooms, and individual (kiosk) exam slots at partner sites are a limited resource that should be prioritized for customers.
