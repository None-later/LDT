====== SSH Configuration ======
Created Sunday 18 March 2018

===== My preferred solution: =====
sshd is normally already installed/started & firewall is open. But just in case:
systemctl start sshd
systemctl enable sshd
firewall-cmd --permament --add-service=ssh
firewall-cmd --reload

To block:
firewall-config   #gui
-> permanent
-> Zones, public -> rich riles. -> Add.
	Family : ipv4, 
	service : ssh, 
	action : reject
	IP : ....... 
-> Options -> reload.

To test/verify this, you can block the client IP an check that ssh is blocked.

===== Other Solutions =====
**Sol 2: (blog)**
On both systems:

vim /etc/hosts.allow
sshd: *.distinct10.example.com       #note space after ':'
OR
sshd: 172.25.10.0/255.255.255.0

vim /etc/hosts.deny
sshd: *.my133ilt.org
OR
sshd: 172.25.70.0/255.255.255.0

**Sol 1: (youtube vid)**
- adding entried to hosts.deny doesn't require a restart of service.

Qsn.19
SSH Configure 17
- configure SSH access as follows: users have remote SSH access to your virtual systems from within group10.example.com
- client within my133t.org should not have access to ssh on your systems.
Ans:- 
#yum -y install openssh*
#vim /etc/hosts.deny
sshd : 172.26.20.0/24
#systemctl restart sshd
#systemctl enable sshd
#firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
#firewall-cmd --complete-reload
