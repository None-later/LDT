target [target...] : [dependent ....]
	[ command ...]

Arguments in brackets are optional, ellipsis means one or more. Note the tab to preface each command is required.
If any of the dependents are newer than the target (or need to be made), the make executes the commands one at a time.

Make terminates if a command fails. "-" makes it ignore. E.g
clean
	**-**rm file  # works even if 'file' not present.

@ is used to supress echo.

clean:
	@echo this is not printed.
