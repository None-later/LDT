==== Commit info ====
Subject should be: Bug NNNN: BUG_SUMMARY


==== Hudson ====
Hudson SWT testing:
- Uses SWT from compiled I-Builds.
- Uses SWT.tests from patch.
> to test patch, have to wait a day.


==== Hudson scoring ====
-1 is do not merge. get's cleared after a new patch submission.
-2 is do not merge and it doesn't get clearned. Has to be cleared manually by user. Patches cannot be merged until cleared.
   (Alex prefers not to set -2). It is evil.
