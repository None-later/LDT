====== duplicate calls in hierarchy target platform ======
Created Friday 28 April 2017

When making a callhierarchy call, you may see duplicate entries in the call hierarchy.

One workaround is turning off:
"org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_64" (not .source) from target platform, 
but this will break dark theme because org.eclipse.e4.ui.widgets's dependency on (?OS.setDarkTheme..()?).
A workaround to the workaround is fix the META.MF and add gtk as export, but meh...

So there's a tradeoff here.
