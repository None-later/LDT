====== Win32 setup ======
Created Monday 06 March 2017

===== Windows 10 setup: =====
- Download java 8
- Download nightly Eclipse Win32

===== Eclipse setup: =====
- Eclipse plugins:
— Eclipse/Gerrit integration (aka EGerrit)
— Git Integration for Eclipse
— Mylyn Reviews Connector: Gerrit
— API Tools Execution Environment Descriptions

- Add views: Task Repositories, Git Repositories, History, Staging

- In "Task Repositories" add Eclipse Reviews
- In "Git Repositories", clone a repo, Gerrit, refresh, clone:
  - platform/eclipse.platform.swt (Import all projects)
  - platform/eclipse.platform.swt.binaries  (Import only project with your architecture)
  (I search for "*swt" to find them)
  - Note: If SSH error occurs, try selecting "https://USER@git..." from dropdown.

- In Command line: 
   cd c:\Users\YOUR_USER\git\eclipse.platform.swt\bundles\org.eclipse.swt
   copy .classpath_win32 .classpath
   (Note, "/build/" contains a classpath, but we ignore it)

- Close/reopen swt project, this fixes "The type java.lang.Object cannot be resolved".

- In  git\*swt\examples\*snippets  do  copy .classpath_cocoa .classpath
  this should fix snippet project.

- swt test project needs performance. Clone repo:
  platform/eclipse.platform.releng  (Import only org.eclipse.test.performance)

Now you should be able to:
- Run snippets
- Modify SWT source code. (changes that require binary rebuild are separate)
- Run SWT tests.

**Api baseline**
- Add a new Api baseline based on current setup
- in SWT project, go to API section, go through *all* the tabs and set to "ignore"
