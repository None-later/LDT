OLD notes:
- checkout remote: origin/R_X_maintenance branch as local branch, 
	* Branch name should be something of your choosing, ex: R4_6_maintenance_bug_BkP_487757_ScrolledComposite   (do not name R4_6_maintenance to avoid confusion with maint branch)
	* uncheck 'configure upstream for push and pull'
- Manually copy across lines that have changed.
	* Test patch (jUnits etc..)
	* Add files to staging area
	* Create new commit with new commit msg etc.. 
	* (TODO - figure out a way to cherry pick this business)
- Right click on repo and click on "Push to gerrit" 
	* select: ssh://lufimtsev@git.eclipse.org:29418/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git   (No gitroot in name)
