====== SWT Spy ======
Created Tuesday 07 June 2016

SWT spy is a useful tool to see the widget hierarchy of a snippet, plugin, or pane in Eclipse.

As a note:
* You can detach it and move it to a 2nd monitor.
* Pressing the monitor button (eye) allows you monitor widgets as you move your mouse over them. Pressing "CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+. " freezes the monitor so you can scroll the hierarchy.
