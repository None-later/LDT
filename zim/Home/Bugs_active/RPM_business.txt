====== RPM business ======
Created Monday 03 October 2016

====== Assignment ======
I had the idea that you might package Code Recommenders for Fedora:
http://git.eclipse.org/c/recommenders/org.eclipse.recommenders.git/
It's the only part of the upstream download that we don't ship with Fedora, so it would be nice regain feature parity.

~~Overview of the process for joining the packagers group:~~
~~https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join_the_package_collection_maintainers~~
~~If you've never built an RPM before, this is a decent introduction that should show you how to write a "spec file" and give basic knowledge the "fedpkg" and "mock" tools:~~
~~https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package~~

~~When writing the spec file for a package, I would probably look at a similar existing package for inspiration, here are a couple smallish eclipse plugin examples:~~
~~http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/eclipse-swtbot.git/tree/eclipse-swtbot.spec~~
~~http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/eclipse-epp-logging.git/tree/eclipse-epp-logging.spec~~

~~Don't forget to make sure you comply with the packaging guidelines in general and the java guidelines in particular:~~

~~https://fedora-java.github.io/howto/latest/~~

~~Once you have a package almost ready, you will want to follow the review process to get feedback on it before it gets accepted into Fedora -- I am happy to sponsor you once the package is ready:~~
