- dnf install kernel-devel
- Do Firmware thing. (make & sudo make install)
- Install via fedora instructions.
- To make webcam work: 
  sudo modprobe facetimehd     #not sure if sudo needed
  (Add to start up script...)

====== (Re)Build instructions: ======
cd [[~/gitmisc/bcwc_pcie/]]
git pull
cd firmware
make
sudo make install

cd ..
sudo make 
sudo make install
sudo depmod
sudo modprobe facetimehd

# check if facetime is active:

sudo modprobe facetimehd

Note:
- Doesn't work with custom kernels if they don't have kernel-devel package.
