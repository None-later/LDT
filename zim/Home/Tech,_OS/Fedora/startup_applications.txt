Created Wednesday 20 July 2016

===== To configure applications to launch on startup: (autostart) =====
1) Make the following directory if not created already:
	mkdir [[~/.config/autostart/]]              # Note, this is a folder, not a script.
2) Copy Application '.desktop' files from: [[/usr/share/applications]] to [[~/.config/autostart/]] 

Now if you want to launch a custom script:
1) Copy some *.desktop file into autostart and edit it.
2) Edit the file to your liking.
	Note: the the 'exec=...' line is the command to be executed, you can put your script here. Ex:
	
	cat startupscript.desktop
	[Desktop Entry]
	Name=StartUpScript
	GenericName=Start up script
	Comment=My Script that configures my system startup
	Exec=/home/lufimtse/git/LDT/home/startupscript
	Terminal=false
	Type=Application
	Icon=autokey
	Categories=GNOME;GTK;Utility;
