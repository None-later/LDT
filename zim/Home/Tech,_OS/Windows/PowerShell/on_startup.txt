====== on startup ======
Created Wednesday 19 July 2017

Tested, works well:
	//"What I do is create a shortcut that I place in shell:startup.//
	//The shortcut has the following://
	//Target: C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -Command "C:\scripts\script.ps1"//
	//(replacing scripts\scripts.ps1 with what you need)//
	//Start In: C:\scripts//
	//(replacing scripts with folder which has your script)"//
