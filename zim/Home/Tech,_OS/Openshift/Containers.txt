====== Containers ======
Created Monday 05 June 2017



- Decision was made such that everything works on OpenShift.

Containers
- lightweight ms.
- User space but no kernel. 
- Expose TCP and UDP ports

- AUFS - another unified file system (deals with layers).
- Overlay file system (replace LVM... 

==== Docker ====
- Open source version of Docker now called "Mobi".
- **Mobi:**
  Mobi - doesn't contain CLI. CLI is in docker.
- Red Hat is 2nd largest contributor 

- Socket:
  - in Dockergroup, use socket.

- Deamon runs as root.
  # mount / into /orooot.
  docker run --privilidged -v [[/:/oroot]] centOs [[/bin/bash]]    # This gives root access 

- REST API for communication. (http)..

==== Dockerfile ====
- describes how to build a container image
- sets of steps to build container image
- may require root access

FROM <container>  #ex centos
RUN  yum install -y ruby && yum clean all   #note, not interactive.  #clean container to avoid bloating image.
ADD "file" [[/root]]  # add your file to container. In container, file owned by root.
USER redhat   #change the effective user.   #non-root user.
RUN whomi
USER root
RUN chown ...  # problem with modify. It copies files.

WORKDIR 


Operations should build container (not engineering). 


==== Dockerhub ====
- marketplace for containers
- users pull and push containers
- provides build service

- good for testing, but images are often out of date.
- Best use source code, and build yourself instead.
