====== Importing source into eclipse ======
Created Thursday 07 July 2016

===== Initial =====
The whole folder:
~/jhbuild/checkout/
Can be imported as a c/c++ project (I call it gtk_collection).
But better to  create a project elsewhere and link to it, because you might re-create 'checkout' folder when 
compiling various builds.

====== Fixing indexing issues ======

===== Platform specific includes =====
Some includes are platform or library specific. The indexer might not pickup on those without a little bit of hackery.

==== Ex: Webkit2 include: ====
Webkit based applications are looking for the "#include <webkit2/webkit2.h>', but in webkit the folder is called 'gtk'.
~/jhbuild/checkout/webkitgtk**-2.13.2**/Source/WebKit2/UIProcess/API/**gtk**

Solution is to create a symlink called 'webkit2':
# cd ~/jhbuild/checkout/webkitgtk**-2.13.2**/Source/WebKit2/UIProcess/API #version specific
# this one works if there is 
cd ~/jhbuild/checkout/webkitgtk**-2.***/Source/WebKit2/UIProcess/API
ln -s -T gtk/ webkit2

Then refresh eclipse project, rebuild index etc...

===== Generated code through 'configure' =====

==== Ex: gsize in glib ====
Some headers are generated when you run 'configure'. For example if you use gsize anywhere like:
	gsize       str_length;
The indexer might throw an error complaining that it's not defined.
If you grep around for it "grep -r 'gsize;' | grep typedef;" you may observe that it's in some 'configure.ac' file where the type is a bash variable:
	configure.ac:typedef unsigned $glib_size_type_define gsize;
In this case:
- navigate to the relevant source repo (**glib**) and execute './configure'. 
- Refresh the Eclipse project.
- Right click on 'glib' -> index -> update with modified files
