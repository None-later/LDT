====== signal and event handling ======
Created Friday 08 July 2016

====== Tutorial ======

===== Basic button press =====
{{{code: lang="c" linenumbers="True"
// Basic handler:
static void
print_hello (GtkWidget *widget,
             gpointer   data)
{
  g_print ("Hello World\n");
}
...

 // Basic registration of signal:
 main {
 ..
 button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("Hello World");
 g_signal_connect (button, "clicked", G_CALLBACK (print_hello), NULL);
 ..
 }
}}}

See the widget 'signals' to see which signals can be connected to. (ex GtkButton -> Signals)

===== Swapped =====
The idea behind connect_swapped is that you call an existing handler with another widget as it's widget.
Ex here the 'window' is passed as the main widget to the destroy function. I.e pressing the button destroys the window:
{{{code: lang="c" linenumbers="True"
g_signal_connect_swapped (button, "clicked", G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_destroy), window);
}}}


===== Passing another widget as data =====
You can pass another widget or structure as data, just be attentive to casting.
{{{code: lang="c" linenumbers="True"
static void
handlerFor_button_go (GtkWidget *widget,
			gpointer data)
{
	GtkEntry *address_entry = data;
	g_print(gtk_entry_get_text(address_entry));
}

...
GtkWidget *address_entry1 = gtk_entry_new();
g_signal_connect (go_button, "clicked", G_CALLBACK(handlerFor_button_go), address_entry1);
..
// taken from webkit.c snippet.
}}}

Make sure to initialize pointers before passing them as data.

====== Events ======
Events are generic things like button_press_event. They are handled differently:
