====== webkit1 dup ======
Created Tuesday 30 January 2018

~ I'm doing some bugzilla spring cleaning/Triaging.

Based on bug report and stack trace:

		at org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.OS.g_main_context_iteration(OS.java:2258)
		at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell.setVisible(Shell.java:2051)

This is a duplicate of:
509587 â€“ (webkit1JvmCrashes) [Browser][Webkit 1] JVM crashes tracking bug
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=509587

I.e, an issue that only occurs in Webkit1. (Please see above bug for details)

Note, as of 4.8 M5, webkit2 is default. People who experience this issue should consider updating to 4.8 M5 when possible or wait for full 4.8 release:
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/

Closing as duplicate for now. (The other bug is shorter and a bit easier for incoming users to read). If this is not the case, please kindly re-open and explain.

If issue still occurs with 4.8 M5+ & Webkit2, please reopen.

Btw, this might not be very obvious from initial observation, setVisibility() usually breaks webkit1, and I see from stacktraces webkit1 was used in some part of ui, e.g "BrowserInformationControl" in:
org.eclipse.jface.internal.text.html.BrowserInformationControl.setVisible(BrowserInformationControl.java:367)

So all these usually trace back to webkit1 in some way or another. It's been the source of a lot of trouble for us.

Please let us know if we can further help. Thanks!

Thank you for your time and bug submissions!

Basically in 4.8 M5 with Webkit2, the issue reported here should not occur. (Let me know if there are)
