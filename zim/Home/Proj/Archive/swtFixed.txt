====== swtFixed removal(?) ======
Created Wednesday 15 June 2016

Remove swt fixed.

===== Notes: =====

==== SWT fixed added because: ====
SWT fixed was introduced in: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=393156
The reason is that accessor functions are needed to access private members, we can't hack things directly:
https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-migrating-2-to-3.html#id-1.6.3.3.5

From author (Silenio Quarti):
	Note that, in the gtk2 implementation, SWT also has a fixed container, but in that case we were able to sub class GtkFixed and override the functions we needed.
	 
	In gtk3, we had to add a new fixed container for these reasons:
	 
	1) the children and possibly other fields (scrollbars?) of GtkFixed were sealed. SWT needs access to it in order to re-order the the children least (moveAbove and moveBelow APIs).
	2) the children z-order in GTK is the reverse of the SWT z-order.  In GTK, the first child is the bottom most child. In SWT it is the top most child (or vice-versa).
	3) The bounds of SWT widgets is fixed and controlled by Control.setBounds(). GTK calculates the widget bounds given its preferred size.  In gtk2, SWT always overwrites the preferred size by calling gtk_widget_set_size_request(). This approach has problems. The size request has to be reset in order to calculate the preferred size of the widget and then put back.   By having, the SWT_Fixed in gtk3, it is easy to get around that behaviour. SWT_Fixed does not calculate the preferred size of its children.
	
More:

	1) SWT wants to have a GdkWindow around every widget in order for clipping to work properly on overlapping widgets.
	2) Some widgets cannot be sized 0x0, the fixed container always can.
	3) It is easier to make mouse events to be relative to the top/left corner of the widget (I think they were relative to the first parent with a window otherwise).
	4) Widgets like table/tree/tabfolder cannot have children easily. There children are put in the wrapping fixed.
 
There could be more (can't quite remember).  Some of these made more sense in the GTK2 implementation, but we did not really wanted to change the implementation completely in GTK3.

===== Architecture =====

=== SwtFixed extends GtkContainer and implements Gtk ===
os_custom.h: SwtPrivate's first field points to GtkContainer -> extends.
os_custom.c ~312 ish : type points to extending GtkScrollable 
https://developer.gnome.org/gtk2/stable/GtkContainer.html
https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkScrollable.html

==== Simmilar to GtkFixed ====
SwtFixed is in many ways simmilar to GtkFixed, except that it has some extra methods like restacking of children, which is needed for layout reasons.

===== Open questions =====
[ ] Why are widgets nested in SWT fixed? 
2016-06-16 : Asked Silenio Qarti 


====== Tasks ======
[ ] SWT fixed should ask it's children to find minimum size. Currently it's 0: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=494183
