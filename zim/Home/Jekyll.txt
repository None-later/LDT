====== Config: ======

===== Install on Fedora =====
sudo dnf install ruby
sudo dnf install gcc mysql-devel ruby-devel rubygems nodejs
gem install jekyll bundler

===== Making a new blog =====
jekyll new myblog   #make new dir called 'myblog' and place new stuff in there.
jekyll new .   # set up in current dir.

===== Running Jekyll =====
cd myblog
bundle install

# runs jekyll server, by default on port 4000.
**bundle exec jekyll serve**

Follow step 2, touch a Gemfile, put in content, install jekyll
