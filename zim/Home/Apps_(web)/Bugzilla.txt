===== Relative dates =====
-7d = -1w
-24h

Tutorial:

Searches: When using relative dates and times, -1w is now a synonym for -7d and means exactly 7 days. Previously, -1w meant the beginning of the week, which was confusing some users. The same confusion existed for -1d which was different from -24h, and for -1m which was different from -30d. Now if you really want the beginning of the day, week or month, you must use -1ds, -1ws, and -1ms respectively, where "s" means "start of". This change will affect existing saved searches using relative dates.

**Find due bugs:**
-20y to 0d
