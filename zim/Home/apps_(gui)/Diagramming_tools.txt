====== Diagramming tools ======
Created Thursday 20 April 2017

Dia
- Zoom OK-ish. Can be accelerated maybe?
- Pan not bad. (middle click)
- Stencils: Can add SVG shapes. But not best text-support for task-like work.
=> Could be Alternative with some effort?

libreoffice-draw
- bad panning
- didn't seem to have stencils 

Calligraflow
- hangs on wayland after a bit. Same as yde troublu.

Inkscape 
- Doesn't seem to have diagramming properties
