====== colormake ======
Created Monday 08 August 2016

https://github.com/pagekite/Colormake

I put the files into [[~/.local/bin]] 

alias make=colormake

Usage
Type **colormake** whenever you'd ordinarily type make.
Type **clmake** for the same effect, but piped through less.
The colormake-short and clmake-short versions of the commands will massage the output so lines do not wrap, but are otherwise the same.
