====== Debugging ======
Created Monday 27 June 2016

===== Debugging =====

==== Print info about session ====
Print info about every command:
	bash -x SCRIPT 

Add lines into your script to print info about parts:
	set -x   # start debug info
	.... // your code 
	set +x # stop debug info

==== Bashdb - Step by step debugging ====

Bashdb is like gdb, you can use it to step through a bash script.

**Install:**
	sudo dnf install bashdb 

**Starting debug session:**
	bashdb <YOUR SCRIPT>

**Commands:**
	l - show local lines. type l again to scroll down.
	s - step line.
	n - next.  (step/next? one might be step into scripts..)
	print $VAR  - print some variable.
	restart - Reload bashscript from file and restart the bash script.
	eval - run a command. Ex: //eval hello world//

	**Breakpoints and continue**
	b <line num> - set breakpoint on some line number.
	c - continue till breakpoint.
	i b - info breaktoints. 
	d <LINE #> - delete breakpoint on line number.
	
	**Info:**
	Useful information about stuff
	i  [CMD] -info command.
		i  b - info about breakpoints 
		i w - info on watch points etc..
	show args - show arguments given to scrpit.

	**Interesting**
	show alias - print all aliases. 
	sh| shell - launch shell,(in middle of execution). Useful to mess around/try things, then continue. "exit" to go back to debug.
