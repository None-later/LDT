Q: Union & Union all?
A: Merges table.  UNION All shows dupliates. UNION is cheaper.

Q: Different types of joins?
A: 
INNER JOIN - (default), returns matches from BOTH
LEFT JOIN - all from left, matching from right.
FULL JOIN - Like union.
CROSS JOIN - every row in A is combined with every row in B.   ( X - multiplied together). 


Q: What does this result:
	select case when null = null then 'Yup' else 'Nope' end as Result;

Thinking: 'case' is like an 'if' statement.

A: But it looks like '=' is not a valid way to compare null. 'is' should be used to compare null.

**Take away: "NULL" needs to be compared via 'IS'. E.g: IS NULL, or IS NOT NULL**

Q: What's wrong with this: (need to see example tables). Note 'races' table has a null.
SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races)

A: If set that is evaluated by 'NOT IN' contains null values, resulting set will be empty.
   fix:
   SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races where winner_id IS NOT null)

**Take away:  IS IN (... NULL)  will return an empty set. Filter out  null values.**
