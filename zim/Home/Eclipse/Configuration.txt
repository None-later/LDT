====== Configuration ======
Created Thursday 16 June 2016

===== Getting Eclipse =====
From download, I go with Nightlies. 

There are update sites. "Updates" is for eclipse core compoents. "Release" is for plugins like mylyn/cdt etc..
I remove existing update sites and add the following:

NOTE ON ALEX setup:
- Uses "nightly" with "release update site for neon".
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.7-N-builds/    << Nightly, update for 4.8+
http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon/  << Release 

//(Note static site: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/N-builds  sometimes doesn't re-direct properly, use hard-coded number)//

===== Fedora Dependencies =====
**Java source code:  **//(may change when java 9 comes out)//
sudo dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk-src   

===== Plugins =====

==== Needed: ====
- SWT Tools
- CDT 
- [Eclipse Plugin Development Tools]    // This is needed so that you can spawn a child eclipse.
	— Eclipse PDE Plugin-Developmer Resources
	— Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment 
- API Tools Execution Environment Descriptions  // To remove errors from SWT project
- NOTE. Platform and Javatools don't seem to be required on Nightlies. 

==== Optional: ====
- Mylyn bits
- Programming languages -> Dynamic languages Toolkit - Shelled IDE

==== Maybe neeed (not sure) ====
- Eclipse Platform SDK  << NOT child eclipse.
- Java development tools (search java)
- egit, update site:
 http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates

===== Configuration of properties =====
* [x] Refresh using native hooks or polling:  General -> Workspace

===== Tweaks: =====

==== Escape strings when pasting ====
When pasting multi-line strings, eclipse can convieniently escape them for you.

	Preferences/Java/Editor/Typing/ "Escape text when pasting into a string literal"

==== Getting rid of errors: ====
- Build path specifies execution environment J2SE-1.4. There are no JREs installed in the workspace that are strictly compatible with this environment.

==== Removing “.class” and duplicate entries from open resource: ====
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2632419/how-do-i-hide-class-files-from-the-open-resource-dialog-in-eclipse
I.e, right click a folder and click on “Derived”. Make sure derived are not shown in open resource filter.

==== Fixing Import suggestions (ex no more AWT…) ====
