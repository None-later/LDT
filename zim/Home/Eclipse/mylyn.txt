===== Cool things to do: =====

==== Searching bugzilla ====
I find it's generally much faster to search bugzilla via task search than through the web interface because eclipse keeps a local copy of the bugzilla db.
Press "Ctrl+h", then click on the "task search" tab.

It's also easier to narrow down the search quickly as you can use the task filter after a task is done. You can also hide completed tasks via the completed tasks filter:
