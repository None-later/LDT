- Lab hours are theoretically limited. 
	- Red Hat pays for hours/used.
	- 80/course, 400/year. 
	- Realistically, you never get there even with heavy use.
	- If you do, you can request more time.
	- Timer not shown really shown, but there.
	- I.e, you can use online interface, but don't leave it running for days. 

Labs:
- Show Provision lab & open consoles.
- Provisioning is slow. Explain workaround of concurrently using RH124/134/199/254/299 labs.

Exam format:
- Kiosk or on Site.
- Practical, provide configuration.
- Most people fail. 
	- 9/10 interns failed. 
	- Know someone who tried 3 times. 
	- I failed RHCSA 1ce and RHCE 1ce.

How to fail:
  - Read, do practice & labs once, re-read notes, try exam.

How to to pass:
- Find motivation and commit.
- Tell others you're doing it. (art of war)
- Practices & labs are fair game. (They will probably not ask this -> Yes they will).
- Use Practices and Labs as test of personal knowledge.
- Practice practice practice lab lab lab lab. (do them lots and often). 
- You should not reference man pages, no notes for all practices.
- No time for man pages on exams.
- Before exam, re-do all practices/labs.

Notes:
- External resources -> not needed for RHCSA, but may need for RHCE.
