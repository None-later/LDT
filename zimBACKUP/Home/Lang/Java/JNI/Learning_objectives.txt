- Briefly, what is SWIG? What does it provide?

Pracice:

- C should modify it and return it back to java.
- For setting up eclipse and understanding how to do it, see my blog:
https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/11/03/eclipse-for-jni-development-and-debugging-on-linux-java-and-c/

- Compile a new method, such that C calls a java method.
