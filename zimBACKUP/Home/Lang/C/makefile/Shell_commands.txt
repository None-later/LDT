====== Shell commands ======
Created Thursday 18 January 2018

Execute a shell command and assign to a variable: (i.e, executed once).
	DEFAULT_OS_ARCH=$(shell uname -m)

In contrast, backticks will be evaluated when variable is used (which can be multiple times).
	PKGCMD=`pkg --libs ..`
	
	gcc ${PKGCMD} ... ->  gcc `pgk --libs`
