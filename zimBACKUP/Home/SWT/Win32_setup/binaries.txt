====== binaries ======
Created Tuesday 20 March 2018

==== Prereq ====
Java _JDK_  (not jre) 1.8 ish.


===== Getting binaries to build: (Not tested, but someone mentioned) =====
	Conrad Groth <info@conrad-groth.de>

Hi,
I recently configured my windows 10 laptop, to rebuild the SWT binaries.
I started with the steps from list item 6 on https://www.eclipse.org/swt/jnigen.php
Unfortunately these steps don’t work without these additional measures:
-  Start you eclipse with an environment variable JAVA_HOME pointing to your JDK folder. I created a cmd file with this contents:
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45
start c:\eclipse\eclipse.exe
-  Create a folder C:\BUILD\swt-builddir (it has to be exactly named like this)
-  Install the “Windows Server 2003 SP1 SDK” (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6510 ) to “C:\BUILD\swt-builddir\MSSDKs\Windows Server 2003 SP1 SDK”
-  Make a symbolic link “C:\BUILD\swt-builddir\ibm-sdk50-x86_64”, that points to your JDK (alternatively install the JDK to that folder)
Inside that folder you have the folders bin, include, jre…
-  Copy the file jawt.lib from the lib subfolder to jre\bin
With these steps I managed to build the SWT binaries locally, but without the XULRUNNER. That build step had an error, but as I didn’t need those artefacts, I was happy.
Have fun,
Conrad

===== Leos notes on getting things to work: =====
Sim link C:\BLUID\swt-bluiddir\ibmsdk50-x86_64\    to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk....
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Name ibm-sdk50-x86_64 -Target 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8...'

- Install Vistual Studio (for developer cmd prompt) # this is like 20GB btw.
	* Check all the "C/C++/Linux" related bits and pieces
- Start "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017 (this adds 'cl' compiler & other build tools to path)
- (Not 100% about these two)
  In dev command prompt:
	set SWT_JAVA_HOME="C:\BUILD\swt-bluiddir\ibmsdk50-x86_64"
		# also, not sure if needed:
	set SWT_BUILDDIR="C:\BLUID\swt-builddir\"

Note:
- build.bat in bluild.xm (in binaries x64_86 repo) is (for each compile) copied from
  org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT PI/win32/library/build.bat
-  

[ ] Should fix the lack of quotes around the bash script.
