====== ssh ======
Created Thursday 29 June 2017

===== Get ssh working via the Ubuntu emulation =====

Try:
https://superuser.com/questions/1111591/how-can-i-ssh-into-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows-10
- Enable ssh via hacks mentioned above

- Disable Windows's SSH proxy & broker from services. (stopping is not enough).
- Configure ubuntu/bash to autostart ssh
	vim .bashrc :
	service ssh status &> [[/dev/null]] || sudo service ssh start      # auto start ssh if not started.



Note:
Seems native ssh-server has too many restrictions:

It works, but you only get windows command line access.
