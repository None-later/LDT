About: Odd numbers in a range.
Q: given l (lower) and u (upper) range, return an array of odd numbers in between.
e.g: 3 & 9 -> 3,5,7,9

So far:
- I can loop over it and count the numbers.
- make array of that size.
- Then loop over them again and pick odd numbers (val % 2 == 1) & increment an array index.
Problem: 3 * O(n).

There is probably some clever way of doing it.
