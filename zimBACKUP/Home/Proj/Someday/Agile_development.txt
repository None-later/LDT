One idea: It seems to me that a lot of the Agile principles (from http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) are essentially Open Source principles as well. All this "release early, release often" and so on is Agile.

Second idea: Is it even possible to manage an open-source project? You can manage the contributors inside single company, but you cannot manage indie contributors and other companies, right? So any methodologies on the project level are meaningless.

Third idea: I saw few talks by these two people, which seem to be mostly based on the presenters experience from the SVN project, one of them wrote some team management books, e.g. http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018025.do They mostly focus on keeping contributors focused on writing code and away from flamewaring on mailing lists.
