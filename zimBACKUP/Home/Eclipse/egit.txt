====== Usage ======

===== Squashing commits =====

==== Multi-select ====
You can select a bunch of commits, right click, modify -> Squash:
{{./pasted_image.png}}

All selected commits will be squished into a single new commit. [[http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2014/06/23/git-improvements-top-eclipse-feature-luna-3/|SRC]]

==== Manually ====
Say you have three commits locally, but not in upstream:
	Bugfix 
	|
	Improvement 
	|
	Feature 1
You want to compress them all into 'Feature 1'. In this case:
- select 'Feature 1', do a reset -> soft  (Head Only).
- Now changes in Improvement and bugfix will be in stages area and you can 'ammend' to Feature 1 (or do a seperate commit).
