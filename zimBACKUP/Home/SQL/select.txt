====== Select ======
Created Friday 20 April 2018

==== # Syntax ====
SQL-DML-Statement
FROM table_name 
WHERE predicate

==== # Print out all fields with some conditions. ====
SELECT * FROM `myTable` t 
WHERE t.myField1 >= 100000 		# Numeric comparison.
	AND T.myField2 = 'SomeStr';	    # String comparison.


==== # Print a specific field: ====
SELECT fieldA, fieldB .... 

==== # Unique results with DISTINCT keyword ====
http://www.geeksengine.com/database/basic-select/eliminate-duplicate-rows.php
select DISTINCT

==== # Where w/ some math ====
Src: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8100622/finding-even-or-odd-id-values
where ((ID % 2) = 0)   # even
where ((ID % 2) <> 0)  # odd.

==== # Count output ====
SELECT COUNT(CITY) FROM STATION;   # 499
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) FROM STATION;
SELECT COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) FROM STATION;

SELECT expr1, expr2, COUNT(aggregate_expression),
FROM tables
[where CONDITIONS]
GROUP BY expression1, expression2,

==== # ORDER RESULTS. ====
... ORDER BY birth;  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sorting-rows.html

==== # SELECT 1 from table where field=value; ====
Return a set of 1's:
1
1
1 .. 
for every matching row.
E.g useful to check if you have an entry for a given key:
  if exists(select 1 from table where some_column = 'some_value')

# Find longest String.  -> order by length(CITY)
# Only get top X results.  (mysql == limit X, other db systems have 'select TOP X).
SELECT CITY, length(CITY) FROM STATION group by city order by (length(CITY)) limit 1;
SELECT CITY, length(CITY) FROM STATION group by city order by (length(CITY)) DESC limit 1;

**# Select unique cities that start with vowels (a,e,i,o,u).**
**# Can utilize 'LIKE'. It's case sensitive, so need to use LOWER(..).**
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION 
WHERE LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'a%'
	OR LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'e%'
	OR .....;

**# Alternatively, can use REGEXP. It's case-insensitive.**
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY REGEXP '^a|^e|^i|^o|^u';

**Syntax:**
^a  - starting with. (implies a.*  , e.g matches 'Alphabet').
a$  - ending with a. (implies .*a  , e.g matches 'Mehalina')
.   - any character
* - zero or more occurances. e.g   .*   matches anything for any number of characters.
+   - one or more.

[abc].*[efg] - grouping, e.g matches stuff like:  aZZZZZg  or bZZZZf
P[^a]n - [^] means negative : P[NOT a]n
Combined: [^abc]   Not a,b,c.  e.g:  ^[^abc]  not start with a,b,c.

|  - logical OR  (COND1 | COND2).  e.g  '^[^abc]|[^xyz]$' < Doesn't start with abc or end with xyz.


[:CLASS:] Classes of characters. E.g alnum  alpha  digit lower upper  etc...
\\ - escape.

REF:

E.g ending with vowels:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY REGEXP 'a$|e$|i$|o$|u$';

E.g starting and ending with vowels:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$'

E.g not starting with vowel.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[^aeiou]';

E.g not ending with vowel.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP '[^aeiou]$'
