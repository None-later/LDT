====== Week 05 2018 ======
28 January to 03 February

====== Weekly Report ======
Highlights:
- Fixed Gtk Webkit2 inconsistency, now Nebula's RichTextEditor works.
- SWT Bugzilla bug analysis/report. We have consistent (avrg) 376.75 new SWT bugs every year for last 10 years.

Last 7 Days:
- Fixed Webkit2 corner case where gtk clients can run into a deadlock
  when a Browserfunction callback calls javascript with return value.
  On Win32/Cocoa, in a dead-lock situation, return value is ignored.
  I implemented check to make Webkit2 behave as Browser does on Win32/Cocoa,
  Preventing deadlock and thus enabling consistent beahaviour as on Win32/Cocoa.
  This is a SWT API restriction as our javascript execution is sync. To allow
  such functionality we'd need to add async javascript execution with callback api.

- Added SWT Tools mechanism so that dynamic gtk/gdk functions would automatically
  be linked to gtk/gdk libs instead of having to manually write custom C code.
  This simplifies SWT development process and makes prototyping faster.
  (~34,000 line refactoring job).

- Stared Gtk3 Bugfix on in-place table editing gtk3 regression (Bug 510803).
  This might be a paint issue simmilar to what Eric is working on.

Trivia: (>30 mins)
- N & N Webkit2 note.
- Improve error message when Webkit(1|2) package not present on system.
- Minor swt.jar build script upgrade.
