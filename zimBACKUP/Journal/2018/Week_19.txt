Last 7 Days:

- Intern Presi took up a good chunk of time.
- Bug 498217 [GTK3][DnD] Dragging parts does not show rectangle
   * Currently the preview-rectangle is actually a transparent shell with a boarder.
   * Investigated alternative approach that is used by layouts spy, but it doesn't
	 work when mouse is held down.
   * Now investigating to instead use native "tracker" widget, but I found that
	 tracker doesn't work on Wayland properly.
   * Will work on trying to get it to work on X11 first, then investigate wayland after.
   * This fix will take a while... 

Bug 534555 - [GTK] Browser stops responding and throws an error on dispose (Browser crash)
 * More users seem to be using webkit2 now.
 * User reported issue with long-executing javascript.
 * Could not reproduce locally, but wrote a patch that could potentially improve the situation.
