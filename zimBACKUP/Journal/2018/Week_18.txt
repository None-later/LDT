- Tried Xournal - good. Had to compile manually.
   https://sourceforge.net/p/xournal/code/ci/master/tree/
   git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/xournal/code xournal-code
   cd xournal-code/
   ./autogen.sh
   make
   cd /src 
   ./xournal

- Contacted Xournal maintainer:
  Zbigniew Jedrzejewski Szmek

- Tried Jarnal - subset of Xournal's functionality.
  Ran via: java -jar jarnal.jar
- Couldn't get Hoodle to work, (conflicting packages on Fedora 28, seemed like it would be hard to keep up to date).
- Tried Write from: http://www.styluslabs.com/download/
	- Didn't work well on Wayland/Fedora 28. (Couldn't select some tools). Lacked 'keyboard typing' input.

  Highlight:
  ##########
  - Fixed (with Eric's suggestion): 533710 – [Wayland] Gnome-shell crashes when selecting an item from List

  Last 7 days:
  ############
   * 533710 – [Wayland] Gnome-shell crashes when selecting an item from List
	 - TL;DR; New in ~Gtk3.22, invisible windows have their GdkWindow disposed.
			  Fix is not to hide windows when we add event hooks & manipulate them.
	   Details:
	 - Eclipse would cause all of gnome shell to crash.
	 - Found a way to run eclipse in mutter (wayland session window), so that
	   when eclipse crashes, it only crashed mutter instead of whole desktop.
	 - Debugged Mutter, found that issue was in invalid gdk surface being passed
	   from eclipse through gtk down to wayland.
	 - Found commit that broke things. (at the time it was working, but due
	   to later underlying changes in gtk, it caused breakage and caused regression)
	 - Eric made a good suggestion on gtkWindow visibilty code. Upon digging deeper
	   into it, that was the root cause. I.e, making windows invisible before
	   before attaching events to it caused these events to pass an invalid window
	   reference to Wayland.

	* 534089 – [GTK3] Tabfolder setControl(..) breaks with a table that has composite controls
	  - Implemented quickfix (reparenting using a deprecated function) so that
		Photon release would function well.
	  - Long-term fix is complicated as we'd have to re-parent all underlying
		gdk windows. A new mechanism may need to be implemented for gtk4 port.

	* (50 min effort) Wrote "IRC quick start guide" with diagram, as there was
	  a complaint on memo list that IRC was too complicated.
	  Received 7 likes and 157 unique page visitors. 
	  Article was later referenced on memo list.

	* This is not a major problem for experieced users, 
	  but may bother new users and hinder eclipse adoption.
