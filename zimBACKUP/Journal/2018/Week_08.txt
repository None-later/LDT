====== Week 09 2018 ======
25 February to 03 March

====== Weekly Report ======
Highlights:
- (WIP)

Last 7 Days:
Overview:
- Gtk TreeCheese 
- Webkit2 can't load self-signed websites.

Bulk of my time:
- (WIP) Gtk3 TreeCheese with custom drawn trees #531048
    Issue caused by column packing & columns not being setVisible properly on Gtk3.
    Issue doesn't occur if column width set manually.
    I have a potential fix, but need to investigate why issue occurs.
- [Webkit2] Crash in webkit on hover #531593
    User is using old-ish version of SWT, 
    Crash doesn't occur for me, but added some preventative measures that should avoid
    crashes in any strange corner-case situations.

Investigations:ls
- 531341 Webkit2 can't load self-signed websites.
    On OSX it shows a message asking if user wants to proceed. On Gtk it just shows can't load.
    Implemented proof-of-concept to get it working on Webkit2.
    Will continue after TreeCheese.
- 527729 – Eclipse looks bad with GTK 3.22 and non Awaita theme
  We hard-code some sizes to fix eclipse on Adwaita, but in the process break
  non-adwaita themes. Fix is to load some fixes only if Adwaita is there.

Triage & user support:
530678 – [webkit2] UI hangs after navigating through Javadoc hover
530869 – [Gtk3][Browser] browser getText() returns empty string on Fedora 26
531378 – Ctrl+ <keys> oblivious to keyboard layout
500924 – [GTK] Applications using eclipse swt crash when disposing widgets
530613 – [Gtk][Ubuntu][LXDE][Color] javadoc view and doc hovers have black background (With an old workspace)
531253 – JVM crash while moving columns in the problems view and pressing escape
531378 – Ctrl+ <keys> oblivious to keyboard layout
531573 – [GTK3][Ambiance theme] Combobox background does not look good

Next 7 Days:

- Investigate webkit hang-issue #530678
