04 March to 10 March

====== Weekly Report ======

Highlights:
- TreeCheese wip 
- Verification of Milestone bug fixes.

Last 7 Days:
- Bug 531048 (TreeItemCheese) - [GTK3] Large problems drawing ownerdraw tables 
  * Spent a lot of time investigating, read & debugged gtk code.
  * Found that issue seems to be caused by gtk3 caching mechanism not
	initializing drawing correctly if tablecolumn is invisible during initial caching.
	i.e, between 5th and 10th main_context_iteration, if tableColumn is not visible,
	then some initialization routines are not ran and we get buggy behaviour.
  * Haven't found a clean-solution yet, as we don't know when gtk will do it's caching.
	One option is to delay hiding of tableColumn till it's 'safe' to do so,
	but we don't know when that would be.
