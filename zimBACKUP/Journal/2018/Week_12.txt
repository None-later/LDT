Highlights
- WIP

Last 7 days:

Did some work on Windows:
- Setup Windows box. Figured out how to rebuild of native bindings and tested/verified windows XP support removal patch (10,000+ lines)
   (It's a very large contribution that isn't getting attention from IBM windows guys).
- Updated SWT/window build script. Removed hard-coded paths & implemented automatic JDK lookup,
  to make SWT compilation work out-of-the-box on windows.
- Upated SWT compilation documentation for windows.

Webkit:
- Investigating opening external links in Javadoc crash.
- Crash seems to occur if we dispose webkit's parent shell while it's trying to load an external page.
  Not related to evaluation/GDBus etc.. something seems to crash inside webkit.
- Investigating mechanism to delay disposal.

Answered a few SWT tagged questions on StackOverflow:
* Eclipse SWT flyout example - Stack Overflow
* SWT Table Viewer add checkbox on row selection - Stack Overflow
* SWT - Table Viewer center checkbox - Stack Overflow

Review:
* Bug 461646 - Allow EOL+EOF in 8bit RE-encoded BMP | git.eclipse Code Review
* Bug 532632 - showWhile(): add disposal check | git.eclipse Code Review

Triage:
* 532340 – [Gtk] Frozen UI opening a shell
* 532632 – SWTException below Workbench.close (thrown in Widget.checkWidget)
* 532787 – SWT Browser implementation with GTK WebkitWebView

Misc:
