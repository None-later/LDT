- (Webkit2 port in progress)


This week:
510905 : Webkit2 Browser Function:
	- Integrated Webkit2 extension into SWT code base
	* Now compiles separate .so library and loads it correctly
	* One tricky aspect was that webkit2 loads extension .so's in
		  a different way than the rest of SWT usual lib loading.
		  I found that '.so' have to be in a separate folder.
	- Next need to implement javascript callback functionality and GDBus communication

Road:
(Webextension+GDBUS) -> SWT internal -> Public
					   â†³ Integrate Webextension  [done]
						 â†³ Implement javascript callback   Week 38
						 | â†³ Implement GDBus               Week 38/39
						 |   â†³ Implement type conversion via GType  Week 39/40
						 |     â†³ Integrate into SWT Browser function mechanism Week 40/41
