Webkit2:
- BrowserFunction:
  * Timeline: If nothing strange pops up, I plan to finish by this week.
  * Last week I've researched/learned and implemented dynamic bindings for gdbus
	communication between webextension and main SWT process.
	The reason is that compiled gdbus bindings are complicated to work with,
	maintain and deal with in general. Modifications require re-compilcation and
	writing a fair bit of custom JNI glue code. Dynamic bindings can be done on pure
	Java side with native calls.
	Also by using dynamic bindings I could re-use much of Sami's patch
	(which used dynamic bindings) and save time.
  * Re-used/packaged Sami's implementation to package/unpackage
	Javascript -> GDbus -> Java types.
  * Work left is the final bit of code to link Browserfunction calls with SWT's Functions
	& provide return value.
