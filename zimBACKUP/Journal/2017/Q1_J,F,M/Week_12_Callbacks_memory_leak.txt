- Bug 513938 Fixed memory leaks that caused "No more callbacks" failures in jUnit
  - Alex.k found that some jUnits were failing with "no more callbacks", and pointed to leaky source code.
  - Turns out I helped Ian introduce some memory leaks into SWT in recent DnD patch unknowingly.
  - Implemented a little framework for finding memory leaks caused by Callback. (Will continue with this after webkit2 port).
  - Found two leaks,
  - Re-implemented mechanism(s) to avoid using additional callbacks and thus fixing leaks.

- Bug 510694 - [Webkit2] Implement 'close' for webkit2 
	- Observed that there is a sublte difference in javascript execution in webkit2 
	  in a rare situation where close() is being executed on a webkit2 instance that's already disposed. 

- Verified that Eclipse works with Webkit 2.16 (Which is to be shipped in Fedora 26).
  As a note, jUnit & Eclipse runs quicker with Webkit 2.16 as they turned on Hardware acceleration on demand.

Bug 510905 - Webkit2 support for browser function's return value
 - This is the last "api" to be implemented for webkit2 port to be completed. But it's time consuming and rarely used.
 - Did a technical feasibility study, estimating that it would take ~1-2 months to implement due to complexity.
	Complexity is because there is no native Webkit2 api, would have to access webkit2 directly via webextensions/javascriptCore
 - Crawled/cloned all 956 eclips.git repositories, found that return value of BrowserFunction is only very rarely used,
   (Eclipse Nebular's Rich text editor)
 - Postponing work on bug for now, to fix some more pressing problems.
