==== Weekly Report ====

Highlights:
###########
- Ported setJavascriptEnabled() api to webkit2 and fixed broken Browser 20 jUnit tests that failed on OSX.

Last Week:
##########
- Setup an OSX laptop and Win32 VM for testing SWT patches.
- 510446 tested Ian's patch on OSX/Win32. 
- 512627 Fixed breakage of jUnit tests on OSX.
   With recent update to OSX build server, 20 browser tests that I wrote were failing on the OSX build server.
   I fixed the issue by improving the wait-logic of the jUnit tests,
   this took a while because tests were passing locally on my OSX laptop, but failed on server.
- 511874 Fixed a browser jUnit test that wasn't working on Win32
  This is because on Win32 the Browser Widget has a child item (ActiveX control)
- 511228 Ported enable/disable javascript api and wrote jUnit tests for it.
- Fixed up Snippet270 (popup example) to use a webpage with an actual popup.
Webkit2 port progress in general:
|---------------|--------------------|___|
				^Started here        ^Here now
Left to do:
  - I found that settings/properties are not ported yet. I'm going through them now.
