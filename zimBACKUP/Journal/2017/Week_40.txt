08 October to 14 October

====== Weekly Report ======

Highlights:
- Submitted a number of Webkit2 crash/error fixes.

Last Week:
##########

Webkit2 port took a small d-tour. As Webkit2 is gaining popularity, I had to address some more immediate issues.
- #522733 Fixed a crash-on-close issue due to double de-reference of webkit2 pointer on Webkit 2.18
	 * JVM was dereferencing webkit-webview on it's on_exit() handler.
	 * Fix currently good enough for production. Root cause to be investigated later.
- #525340 Me/Nick fixed error where JBoss Central page failed with javascript
	execution error due to webkit2 port bug (Thank you Roland /Alex for report).
- #514859 Went through all Webkit1/2 native functions and added asserts, to guard
	webkit1 calls being called by webkit2 (to prevent crashes). Found that Webkit's 'Download' functionality
	has not been ported yet. (I will submit bug later).

Other:
- Started on SWT Tutorial for Eclipse con.

Triage
- Bug 345477 â€“ Display.getSystemImage(SWT.ICON_QUESTION) returns null on 32-bit swt on 32-bit java on 64-bit Ubuntu 11.04    

This week:
