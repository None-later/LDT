Webkit2: Fixed javascript deadlock and javascript scope regression.
Webkit2: Verified no webkit1-only logic is used by webkit2.

Last Week:
##########
Webkit2:
  - Found and fixed deadlock in javascript execution. #527564
	* Casued due to (internal call) recursive invocation of javascript from callbacks.
	* Turns out those execution's didn't require a return value, so I made
	  them execute without waiting for return value, which fixed deadlock.
	* Did a root-cause analysis and set all simmilar code to not ask for
	  a return value if none needed.
	* Patch awaiting merge.
  - Found and fixed a regression in scope of execute() for javascript execution #527737
	* 'execute()' was wrapping code into functions like 'evalute()', which
	  broke scope as two exectue() statements may rely on being in the same scope.
	* Fix was to only wrap 'evaluate()' calls into a function and run execute()
	  calls directly.
	* patch awaiting merge.
  - Verified that no webkit1 signals are called by webkit2 #514859
	* This completes internal check that no webkit1 methods/properties/signals
	  are called by webkit2 anymore.
	* Added relevant documentaion. 
  - Me/Roland investigated hackaround to implement setUrl(..) with postData, #527738
	* Webkit2 doesn't provide api, so we have to make due with alternative.
	* Roland came up with method that uses java Connection and pass return
	  data to Webkit. (work in progress)
	* If Rolands java-Connection doesn't work, I may have a javascript alternative
	  ready for next week/M5.
	* This is the last api to implement for webkit2 port to be complete.

Webkit2 port overview:
  - Assuming Webkit2 BrowserFunction works, we just need to finish setUrl(..postData..)
	and then we can set Webkit2 to be default.

Triage:
	461963 – UI freeze of 2.1s in Browser.<init> (99)
	471824 – Diagnosing errant uses of Display.getDefault() is hard
	4745 – [StyledText] StyledText does not provide a disabled look (1GG00JX)
	522733 – [Gtk][Webkit2] Crash on close with webkitgtk 2.18
	527564 – (webkit2ExecHang) [Webkit2] Deadlock due to blocking javascript execution in a synchronous callback from webkit2
	527806 – Ship all themes (Win, GTK...) for all OS, and let users pick whichever they want
	527880 – [Gtk3] Menu "Open Implementation ..." do not work when "Allow different sources for each window" is enabled in Gnome

This Week:
##########
Webkit2
- Little bit of webkit2 code cleaning. (remove some warnings, only compile lib if underlying packages are available etc..)
- Add guards around some calls that require certain webkit2 versions. (~1/2 days work)
- Investigate how some Nebula widgets that use Webkit2 behave. Verify that they work well. (to see if there are any webkit2 regressions)
- Webkit2 focus listener
