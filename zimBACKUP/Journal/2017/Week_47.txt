====== Weekly Report ======

Highlights:
- Webkit2: 
  * BrowserFunction complete, awaiting build server upgrade.
  * Verified Browser snippets with Webkit2, found a few issues.

Last Week:
- Webkit2:
  Good news:
  * BrowserFunction patch (that I've been working on for a few months) is fully complete
	- Currently awaiting build servers (RHEL 7.4) to start building SWT binaries, (ETA friday)
	- I implemented the mechanism so that the webextension is put into a separate version-defined folder,
	  so that the webextension mechanism wouldn't break if you upgrade to next version of SWT.
	- Verified BrowesrFunction against various snippets, use cases etc..
  Bad news:
  * Traversed all (non-Mozilla) SWT Snippets that use Browser to verify completeness of Webkit2 port.
	- Found that the 'postData' from setURL(url, postData, headers) isn't handled by webkit2. We need to implement
	  the mechanism. E.g open bugzilla and perform a query via postData doesn't work on webkit2.
	  (Vague estimation is I expect this to take ~1-2 weeks to implement). -> Roland.
	- Identified a dead-lock sitatation in javascript execution if multiple browsers are rendered.
	  For 2nd browser, javascript isn't executed till browser is made visible.
	  Appears to be bug in webkit2 logic, but need to investigate. (ETA: TBD)
	- Identified a regression in javascript execution after my fix for JBoss.
	  (Eta for fix: a few days/week). #527738
  * New Total ETA due to issues: ~1-3 weeks?
