  Handed out free Red Hat swag I receivd from Raleigh. Twittered picture.
  
This week:
- Crossplatform test servers 
  Not perfect, but it's setup in such a way that I can quickly test jUnit submission across Windows/Cocoa/Linux.
  I can SSH into the boxes, checkout relevant commit and run mvn build/test.
  Current limitations:
  - For windows I use a workaround (hack feature.xml) #519583
	Me/Roland spent time debugging this somewhat, but at the moment I settled with workaround for now.
  - maven tests only the swt.tests package independent of SWT sources locally on the machine.
	I.e, I can auto-test jUnit submissions, but not changes to custom widgets.
	(To be investigated someday, when the need arises...)

  I used the auto-test-framework to start merging outstanding Browser test refactoring pachtches I did earlier,
   and found an issue with a test case on Windows.
