====== Weekly Report ======

Highlights:
#######

Webkit2:
- Implemented support for webkit to load extension via OSGI mechanism. 
- BrowserFunction & webextension complete and verified.

Webkit2 port:
- Dependencies:
  * Browser function (Complete)
  * setUrl(.. postData ..) (Probably to be completed this week)
- Non blocking:
  * Found new issue with Mouse/Keybaord listeners. 
	(Not critical, but can probably fix this week)

Last 7 days:
#######

Webkit2:
- Me/Eric/Roland Researched how to build local *swt*.jar with changes to local code base.
  * Used mechanism to develop and verify OSGI functionality when SWT runs as OSGI bundle.
	(extracting webextension via OSGI mechanism)
  * Build required one to set contextQuantified to old date (e.g year 2000), for it to
	read fresh SWT sources.
  * Wrote/submitted a script to do this automatically. Bug 528274 
  * This is to be documented later in SWT documentation refresh.

- Implemented mechanism for SWT to extract webextension via OSGI mechanism.

- Upgraded build scrpit for webextension:
  * Now deletes old webextension (as per Alex's suggestion)
  * Skips building of webextension (printing a warning) if system is missing
	relevant packages. (ppc & some older distro's might not have them.)
  * Fixed 32 bit warning.

- 526909 Minimum Webkit2gtk version guards
  * Added guards around functions, signals and properties that should not be
	called on newer webkitgtk versions, to prevent potential JVM crashes
	on older versions.

Review & QA:
- Bug 527738 [Webkit2] implement setUrl(...POST..) support. (snippet 330)
  * Found U.I blocking behaviour, would benefit from running in separate thread.

- (In progress) SWT Browser widget does not notify Focus Listener. 
  * Was investigating how to implement focus listener, 
  * found that signal was not hooked into webkit widget.
  * Found some issues with other listeners on Webkit2, (e.g mouse click). Need to fix.
