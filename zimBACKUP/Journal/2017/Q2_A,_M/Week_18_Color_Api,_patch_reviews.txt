====== Week 18 2017 ======
30 April to 06 May

====== Observations and Life Lessons ======
- I should spend the first hour of the day learning something new. -> Dedicate 2 poms every morning to learning.
   thought: I should keep track of my learning.

====== Weekly Goals ======
[*] Rename HOVER API
[*] Finish off color related patches
[x] Start on Webkit2 api for getText(..)

====== Weekly Report ======
Highlights:
###########
- N/A - Mostly work in progress this week.

Last Week:
##########
- Bug 508819 – Define proper API for hover/info color constants 
	- Implemented patch to add new api and keep old api for backwards compatability.
	- Several Color fixes depend on this patch.
- Started making a "manual jUnit tests" project. 
	- Some jUnits in SWT need to be ran manually, (e.g Complex DnD operations, Color-related glitches).
	- This project aims to allow run a set of test very quickly for specific areas of code, 
	  (e.g run DnD tests for DnD patches etc...)

Investigations:
- Bug 515779 – [context][3.23][Java] focused package explorer not working if top level element is working set, when (Mylyn DLTK integration is installed) 
	- Issue occurs only when "DLTK mylyn context" plugin is installed.
- "Create Branch" glitch: when typing, cursor is moved the end.
   -> Found that it's already fixed in nighly egit.

Setup Fedora with Wayland VM, such that I can write code on host and test on VM.
	- To test native X11 on my machine and wayland on VM.
	- (to save me from switching back and forth between X11/Wayland,
	   because X11 emulation on Wayland isn't the same as native X11).

Patch review & Testing:
- Bug 515610 – [GTK] SWT generates incorrect code for memmove() 
- Bug 514483 - [wayland] Launchbar filter closes when clicked
  - Wrote (junit-like) snippet to test patch, found issue.

Learning:
- Spent sometime learning a few bits about OpenShift concepts.

Triage/Investigation:
- Bug 515973 – Eclipse and X crash when trying to refactor method signature 
- Bug 514711 – [GTK3] SWT errors and event loop exeptions by switching Tabs 

Next Week:
##########
- Finish off "Manual jUnit project"
- Some Color api work
- Webkit*, update/fix/port Browser1 test to newer browser test suite.
- Webkit2, getText() port.
