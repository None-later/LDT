====== Week 19 2017 ======
07 May to 13 May

====== Weekly Report ======

Highlights:
#########
Resolved some Black/White color issues in platform ui (awaiting reviews), started on getText() webkit2 api.

Last Week:
#########
Started:
Bug 514719 – [Browser][Webkit2] port Browser.getText() to webkit2
* Wrote jUnit
* Working on implementing api.

Fixed:
Bug 516420 – Problem hover status color should be the same as for normal content
Bug 516567 – [GTK] Crash when setting disposed image in Label.setImage
Bug 516533 -- Bug: isEditable="false" colors/fonts can still be edited if referenced by other colors  (Pending review).

Reviews:
Bug 514483 -- [wayland] Launchbar filter closes when clicked
Bug 515773 – [Wayland] Text widget not able to grab focus with SWT.ON_TOP shell

Triage:
Bug 516281 – SWT.VIRTUAL Tree is not truly virtual - it eagerly pre-creates all items - making it very slow
 -> SWT.VIRTUAL is not a true virtual. Pre-loads items. But faster than non-Virtual & faster for many children.
Bug 35930 – [DBCS] No KeyUp for DBCS input
Bug 457656 – 32-bit Eclipse crash on RHEL7
Bug 506134 – Do not load page
Bug 506133 – [Cocoa] [Browser] Login page doesn't load

Research:
Learned about Java 9 and thought about how it could impact SWT/Eclipse
- For internal JVM string representation changed, which could affect our JNI code. Will need to check.
- ProcessHandle Api could make native code debugging easier (find PID), maybe automatically tie in native debugging.
- Spin hints (JEP 285) could be used in event loop, maybe speed up SWT a little bit.

Next Week:

====== Observations and Life Lessons ======
- Time allocation should be performed. Don't overspend time on trivial tasks.
- Keep learning. Learning an hour a day allows me to make some progress daily.

Change I9bfb2052: Bug 514483 - [wayland] Launchbar filter closes when clicked | git.eclipse Code Review

=== Tuesday 09 May ===
Read new in Java 9:
http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessHandle.html
- Thought about how it could affect SWT.
- For example internal JVM string representation changed, which could affect our JNI code.
- ProcessHandle Api could make native code debugging easier (find PID), maybe automatically tie in CDT debugging.
- Spin hints (JEP 285) could be used in event loop, maybe speed up SWT a little bit.
[[Home:Lang:Java:version:9]]

Read about jcmd (java command) and how to use it to see native method memory allocations. (e.g Callback bindings...)
