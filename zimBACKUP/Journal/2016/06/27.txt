- Investigated regression:
Bug 496780 - Bug201002TreeViewerTest.testBug201002 fails on Gerrit
Found it to be a patch we submitted earlier.
- Investigated how to run Platform.UI tests to avoid future regressions.
	- Pulled relevant platform.ui.* sources, found relevant packages & test suits.
	- Investigated some failing test cases in platform.ui.jface|ui for a little bit.
	- However, some JFace/UI test cases fail on my system. Asked platform.ui community about it.

- Support user trying to build SWT/gtk bindings on Alpine linux (Andrei Pozolotin)
