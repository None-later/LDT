Weekly report

##### This week:

## Devel:
(Resolved)
Bug 489025 – [gtk3] Task list does show task icon, categories labels overlap incoming marker: 
 - issue occured due to a small corner case with an unexpected negative value in a comparator 0 > -1 
 - fix was: 0 > max(-1, 0)
 - issue only occured on eclipse, spent time trying to reproduce the issue on a small snippet level 
 	in order to create a junit test case, but stopped as it was taking too much time.

(Implemented)
Bug 496756 - [GTK] [autotester] Add support to select gtk versions
 - rewrote chunks for autotester to handle input paramaters via getopts 
 - added support to allow selection of which versions of GTK+ to test with (ex 3.20, 3.10, 2.24)
 	this is useful when dealing with version specific breakage 
 	

(Investigated regression in Platform.UI:)
Bug 496780 - Bug201002TreeViewerTest.testBug201002 fails on Gerrit
 - Localised it to a patch in SWT 
 - Then investigated how to run Platform.UI tests and which tests to run to help avoid future regressions.
 - Investigated some failing test cases in platform.ui.jface|ui under gtk3.

(Tested patch)
