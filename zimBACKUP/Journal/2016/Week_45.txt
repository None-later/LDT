06 November to 12 November

=== Sunday 06 November ===

=== Monday 07 November ===
Learned that JNI / C uses a modifed UTF-8, not the standard one. 
Investigated SWT String conversion to bytes[]. Differnces in string types (UTF-8, modified UTF-8 used by Java)...

Added some files to:
Native auto generated files should mention that they are auto generated ("DO NOT EDIT - your changes will be lost")

=== Tuesday 08 November ===
Updated old patch that I started as intern:
Bug 461767 - [API] Add an unsynchronized Display.isDisplayThread() method 

Patch review:
Bug 503431 - [wayland] CTabFolder slow when switching tabs (DnD logic issue on wayland) (

=== Wednesday 09 November ===
POST WR:
----------------



=== Thursday 10 November ===
- Learned how SWT tools generates structs on JNI layer.
  (add Java class next to other structs. All fields have to be public).

=== Friday 11 November ===
- Learned how SWT mirrors classes onto Structs in C. 
- Modified swt.Webkitgtk_custom for debugging, debug macros 
- got basic polomorphysim to work.
> next need to make all functions dynamic.

=== Saturday 12 November ===


==== Weekly review ====

Highlight:
- Unreadable Javadoc background/foreground color is now resolved.
  This problem has been around for 4 years and has 13K+ views on stackoverflow:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10383467/eclipse-javadoc-background-color-is-black

Javadoc:
- Information Color Factory was merged (#505738). 
   I.e IDE components can use this to be colored properly.
- Implemented JavaDoc to inherit from the ColorFactory. Now Javadocs look good. (#501742 merged)
- Added CSS styling of Information Color on Dark theme. (Javadoc looks nice on Dark theme) (#505851 merged)
-> Some IDE components (e.g problem assist) need to be updated to use this color factory to improve readability.

JNI:
- Eclipse for JNI development blog article was published:
  http://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/11/03/eclipse-for-jni-development-and-debugging-on-linux-java-and-c/
- Finished Book on JNI. 
  - Learned about methods interfacing with Native libraries (One-to-one mappings, Shared stubbs)
  - Learned about String formats UTF-8 (C), UTF-16 (Java), various ways of conversion and dealing with embedded nulls.
  - Investigated String conversion in SWT code. There is ambuguity on which method to use.

- Tidy up of Eclipse's Converter.java class that converts java strings to C strings.

- Eclipse Camp 
  - Setup wiki page, invited previous participants and University of Toronto Students.
  - So far it seems we have around ~15 people comming.

Finished off a patch that I started as Intern:
- Bug 461767 - [API] Add an unsynchronized Display.isDisplayThread() method 
  
Reviews:
- Bug 503431 - [wayland] CTabFolder slow when switching tabs (DnD logic issue on wayland)


Next:
- Continue with Evaluate() implementaiton.
