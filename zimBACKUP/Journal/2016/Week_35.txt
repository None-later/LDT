(In progress)
Bug 430538 - Webkit2 Javascript port
Stage 1:
- As per Alex's comment, found that my patch was 
	not portable (due to hard webkitgtk4 dependencies).
- Researched and Implemented dynamic calling of 
	webkitgtk functions in SWT's native code.
	This took a long time as I had to learn how to use C
	in a dynamic way, learn advance C-Macro techniques 
	and figure out how to integrate it into SWT
- Now patch works across platforms (Compiled on F24, 
	runs on F21 that doesn't have webkitgtk4)
- Need to polish the patch a little bit before next review.

(Finished)
Bug 500363: Native auto generated files should mention that they are auto generated 
- When doing work with native files, it's not clear 
	as to which files are auto generated and which 
	files are written manually. Especially when you are 
	just starting to work with native C code.
	I modified the SWT Tools compiler to inject a note
	to every generated file about the file being auto-generated 
	and regenerated all natives.
Home:1 proj:1 Archive:Bug 499545 - [win32] Remove UN-necessary native changes from c.c, which is causing linking error during native compilation. (edit)

Other
- Reviewed Alex's patch (Bug 500206) for placing CSS into a file
- Helped Ian setup Fedora VM for testing, showed swt autotesting framework, showed various ways to interact with git in Eclipse etc.. 

Next:
Webkit port: Finish polishing stage 1 patch, start on stage 2.
