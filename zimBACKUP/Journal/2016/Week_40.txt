Overview:
----------
- Worked on default Javadoc text/background color.
- Cleaned up, speed up and documented the SWT browser test																										 suite (as part of Webkit2 port).


Details:
--------

Thursday: Red Hat Road Tour. 
- I was wearing my Red Hat Fedora, which attracted a lot of attention. 
- Answered questions from attendants about Red Hat products.

(Part 4/4) Bug 501742 - Default Javadoc text and background color should use colors consistent with Java editor background/foreground. 
- Implemented an IColorFactory that would produce a different color depending on platform (win,cocoa,Gtk)
   independent of theming engine.
	(This involved some learning, ex about plugin versioning, dependencies between plugins etc.. )
- Lars Vogella reviewed the patch and suggested instead to define color via CSS theme instead of ColorFactory. 
   However that might have issues with some themes or people who do not use CSS engine. I'll be discussing this
   further with Lars.

Bug 312451 - Accessible.addRelations should check if target == null 
- Added a null check as per user request.

Upgraded my system to Fedora 25.
- Eclipse not usable on Wayland at the moment, have to run in X11 backend
- Some Webkit2 test cases hang now, need to fix.

Started on RPM packaging on Monday for Eclipse code recommenders,
But after discussion with Alex, put that on hold until I complete Webkit (/Wayland?) port.

Provided support to an SWT user (who reached out to me) requesting help with DnD problems on Gtk2.18.
-> Recommended upgrading to Gtk 2.24 as issue is fixed there.

Webkit:
- Went over all Browser jUnit tests. 
  * Found that some tests complete 'successfully' on Webkit2, but actually 
	 don't perform desired task.(ex Browser9)
  * Found that some functionality is not tested, or not tested properly. (I should add some extra test cases).
- Cleaned up, Speed up and document Browser test Suite. (96 seconds -> 4 seconds)

Next week:
* Focus on Webkit2 migration. (Work on evaluate())

@newdevs 
When working on a project, open related projects as those could be affected.
ex:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/81726/
Refactoring tasks.ui broke the related test cases.

@wisdom
When asking for a vote, let things stand for a week or two. Give people time to think about it.

Ex:

I went ahead with Solution 2 too quickly here without having received apropriate feedback from other parties invovled. Then Lars opposed to have it in Platform.ui.
