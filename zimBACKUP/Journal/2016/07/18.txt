# The first commit's message is:
Bug 497923:[GTK]build.sh(2): Multiple new improvements

This is a relatively large patch that adds additional paramter support.
Features:
* Build Gtk2 and Gtk3 can *both* be built via a single command:
 ./build.sh clean -gtk-all install
  This replaces the tedious process of having to:
 - In Eclipse, clean project, build Gtk2,
 - In Eclipse, clean Project, build Gtk3,
 - manually copy '*.so' files to binary repository.
* Help parameter (-h, --help) that explains parameters
* Gtk2/Gtk3 can be selected via: "-gtk2, -gtk3"flags
* 'echo' now prefix script name to make debugging easier. ex:
	build.sh: Building SWT/GTK+ for ....
* 'echo now print in color. Green for general msgs, red for error
* Additional actions can be performed after a clean up.
	ex clean, build and copy binaries via command above.
* Added error check for binary repository:
	If user specifies 'install' flag, which normally copies compiled
	*.so files to binary repo, but folder/binary repo does not exist,
	then user is warned and the script exits with error.
* Added warning if build.sh is ran without parameters,
	advising users on correct parameters which clean & copy produced
	*.so files to the binary repository (command above)
* Added color to outpu

JAVA_HOME fix:
* build.sh often fails on fresh systems because JAVA_HOME is not set.
  JAVA_HOME is usually blank on most systems.
  The failure usually reads:
	swt.h:23:17: fatal error: jni.h: No such file or directory
	compilation terminated.
  This patch dynamically acquires JAVA_HOME based on the location of
  the 'java' executable. This works on Fedora 24 and on Ubuntu 16
  (and probably on other systems).

  To test:
	export JAVA_HOME=""   #if not already blank.
	./build.sh
  Before the patch the above should fail with missing 'include jni.h',
  after patch, everything should compile fine.
