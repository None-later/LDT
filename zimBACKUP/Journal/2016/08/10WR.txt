(In progress) 
Bug 430538 - [GTK3][webkit] Support Custom JavaScript execution in WebKit2 mode of SWT Browser
 - Modified Makefile to add a webkitgtk_custom.c file and other makefile cleanups.
 - Implemented custom native function with callback to call javascript from native C code.
 - Implemented spinlock mechanism in native code to convert async call into a sync one. 
 	 (I pass pointer to spinlock via user_data to the callback on C side,
 	  this is better than a global spin lock because it allows concurrent javascript executions).
 - Researched Javascript return types and methods to convert to C.
 - Patch is getting a bit large/complex. Will break the patch into stages. 
	 Will push 'stage 1' that will support basic 'execute()' of Javascript, 
	 next will work on 'stage 2' that should support 'evaluate()'.
* Javassript execution, implemented spinlock mechanism in nativecode to convert async call to sync.
* Pass lock as userdata to callback, which unlocks the original caller -> allows concurrent execution, no global locks needed.
* Updated makefile, tie makefile to webkit via pkg-config 
* Need to add conditions to make makefile work on machines that don't have webkit2.
* Break patch into Stages, try to push what I have before working on 'evalute'.


(Finished)
Bug 499387 - Speed up BrowserSuite 
 - Browser tests run very slowly, so slow that they are ran in a separate test suite.
 - Some jUnit tests had 'forced timeouts', which caused delays even if test was finished.
 - Modified some junit test cases to wait till test is finished instead of random timeout.
 - 2x improvement in run time.
 - BrowserTests are notorious for being fragile. I checked the next day: No breakage in build server jUnit test cases.


(finished)
Bug 312451 - Accessible.addRelations should check if target == null 
 - STW user reported to swt-devel mailing list that they receive 2000 crash reports a week from their clients and 
	asked SWT team to look into the relevant bug (reported 5 years ago).
 - Investigated stack trace (no snippet to reproduce), investigated what could cause such NPE.
 - Added null pointer checks around public api. This way clients can add try/catch clauses.

 Other
  - Updated wiki to reflect new build.sh parameters 
  - helped Ian with JNI binding troubles 
  - Investigated broken SWT download links (as reported to swt-devel mailing list)																																														

This week:
 Webkit port: 
   - adapt makefile so that my changes don't break non webkit2 build machines.
   - Push Stage 1 to master. (this should fix several jUnit test cases related to 'execute()')
