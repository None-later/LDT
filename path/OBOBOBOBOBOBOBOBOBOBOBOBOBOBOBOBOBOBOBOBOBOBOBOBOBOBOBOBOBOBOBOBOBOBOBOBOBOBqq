[1mNAME[0m
       timedatectl - Control the system time and date

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mtimedatectl [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mtimedatectl [22mmay be used to query and change the system clock and its settings.

       Use [1msystemd-firstboot[22m(1) to initialize the system time zone for mounted (but not booted) system images.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       The following options are understood:

       [1m--no-ask-password[0m
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

       [1m--adjust-system-clock[0m
           If [1mset-local-rtc [22mis invoked and this option is passed, the system clock is synchronized from the RTC again, taking the new setting into account. Otherwise, the RTC is synchronized from the
           system clock.

       [1m-H[22m, [1m--host=[0m
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username and hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The hostname may optionally be suffixed by a container name, separated by ":",
           which connects directly to a specific container on the specified host. This will use SSH to talk to the remote machine manager instance. Container names may be enumerated with [1mmachinectl -H[0m
           [4mHOST[24m.

       [1m-M[22m, [1m--machine=[0m
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to connect to.

       [1m-h[22m, [1m--help[0m
           Print a short help text and exit.

       [1m--version[0m
           Print a short version string and exit.

       [1m--no-pager[0m
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       The following commands are understood:

       [1mstatus[0m
           Show current settings of the system clock and RTC, including whether network time synchronization is on. Note that whether network time synchronization is on simply reflects whether the
           systemd-timesyncd.service unit is enabled. Even if this command shows the status as off, a different service might still synchronize the clock with the network.

       [1mset-time [TIME][0m
           Set the system clock to the specified time. This will also update the RTC time accordingly. The time may be specified in the format "2012-10-30 18:17:16".

       [1mset-timezone [TIMEZONE][0m
           Set the system time zone to the specified value. Available timezones can be listed with [1mlist-timezones[22m. If the RTC is configured to be in the local time, this will also update the RTC time. This
           call will alter the /etc/localtime symlink. See [1mlocaltime[22m(5) for more information.

       [1mlist-timezones[0m
           List available time zones, one per line. Entries from the list can be set as the system timezone with [1mset-timezone[22m.

       [1mset-local-rtc [BOOL][0m
           Takes a boolean argument. If "0", the system is configured to maintain the RTC in universal time. If "1", it will maintain the RTC in local time instead. Note that maintaining the RTC in the
           local timezone is not fully supported and will create various problems with time zone changes and daylight saving adjustments. If at all possible, keep the RTC in UTC mode. Note that invoking
           this will also synchronize the RTC from the system clock, unless [1m--adjust-system-clock [22mis passed (see above). This command will change the 3rd line of /etc/adjtime, as documented in [1mhwclock[22m(8).

       [1mset-ntp [BOOL][0m
           Takes a boolean argument. Controls whether network time synchronization is active and enabled (if available). This enables and starts, or disables and stops the systemd-timesyncd.service unit.
           It does not affect the state of any other, unrelated network time synchronization services that might be installed on the system. This command is hence mostly equivalent to: [1msystemctl enable[0m
           [1m--now systemd-timesyncd.service [22mand [1msystemctl disable --now systemd-timesyncd.service[22m, but is protected by a different access policy.

           Note that even if time synchronization is turned off with this command, another unrelated system service might still synchronize the clock with the network. Also note that, strictly speaking,
           systemd-timesyncd.service does more than just network time synchronization, as it ensures a monotonic clock on systems without RTC even if no network is available. See [1msystemd-[0m
           [1mtimesyncd.service[22m(8) for details about this.

[1mEXIT STATUS[0m
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       [4m$SYSTEMD_PAGER[0m
           Pager to use when [1m--no-pager [22mis not given; overrides [4m$PAGER[24m. Setting this to an empty string or the value "cat" is equivalent to passing [1m--no-pager[22m.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_LESS[0m
           Override the default options passed to [1mless [22m("FRSXMK").
