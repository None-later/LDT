Oct 03 13:50:36 <lufimtse>	Hello guys. We have a large client who uses JBoss EAP 7.1. RHEL6.9 and they're using *>*oracle JDK 8*<*. They connect to an Oracle DB. I would like to get them to move to OpenJDK instead. Does JBoss work well with OpenJDK, are there any known issues where OracleJDK has to be uesd instead?
