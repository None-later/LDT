Dec 11 09:59:09 <chkoehle>	i have to get lunch probably from swiss chalet, i forgot to make it last night :(
Dec 11 09:59:14 <hukhan>	oooo ok
Dec 11 09:59:19 <hukhan>	let me know when you are back with it 
Dec 11 09:59:25 <chkoehle>	i can eat any time, preferably 11:30 onwards
Dec 11 09:59:29 <hukhan>	I brought mine, but I can eat with you if it's after 12
Dec 11 09:59:40 <chkoehle>	ok i'll HL you when i'm about to go do stuff

Dec 11 10:00:51 <chkoehle>	dun dun dun
Dec 11 10:01:38 <chkoehle>	i told him he should consider staying home a few extra days just so he doesnt bring the stomach flu to work since it spreads like mad and stays virulent for approx 3-7 days even after you feel 100% normal
Dec 11 10:01:54 <chkoehle>	but otherwise i'll just wash my hands a lot
Dec 11 10:01:59 <hukhan>	lolol
Dec 11 10:02:08 <hukhan>	yeah it's good advice
Dec 11 10:07:32 <cchianel>	Would eating lunch when watching you two smash count as work?
Dec 11 10:07:44 <cchianel>	I have to skip lunch due to signal delays :/
Dec 11 10:10:19 <chkoehle>	no one keeps track of time at red hat so you could eat lunch normally and it'l be alright :)
Dec 11 10:10:21 <hukhan>	it will if you want it to 
Dec 11 10:10:22 <chkoehle>	+l
Dec 11 10:11:44 <chkoehle>	plus if you feel guilty about it, you can just use the refunded money from the go trains to buy food
Dec 11 10:12:18 <chkoehle>	or if you feel really guilty about it, eat and have a normal day and wfh when you get home
Dec 11 10:23:31 <lufimtse>	hukhan, I failed at Interact transfer
Dec 11 10:23:38 <lufimtse>	hukhan, I typed link intitially
