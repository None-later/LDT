Dec 11 09:59:09 <chkoehle>	i have to get lunch probably from swiss chalet, i forgot to make it last night :(
Dec 11 09:59:14 <hukhan>	oooo ok
Dec 11 09:59:19 <hukhan>	let me know when you are back with it 
Dec 11 09:59:25 <chkoehle>	i can eat any time, preferably 11:30 onwards
Dec 11 09:59:29 <hukhan>	I brought mine, but I can eat with you if it's after 12
Dec 11 09:59:40 <chkoehle>	ok i'll HL you when i'm about to go do stuff

Dec 11 10:00:51 <chkoehle>	dun dun dun
Dec 11 10:01:38 <chkoehle>	i told him he should consider staying home a few extra days just so he doesnt bring the stomach flu to work since it spreads like mad and stays virulent for approx 3-7 days even after you feel 100% normal
Dec 11 10:01:54 <chkoehle>	but otherwise i'll just wash my hands a lot
Dec 11 10:01:59 <hukhan>	lolol
Dec 11 10:02:08 <hukhan>	yeah it's good advice
Dec 11 10:07:32 <cchianel>	Would eating lunch when watching you two smash count as work?
Dec 11 10:07:44 <cchianel>	I have to skip lunch due to signal delays :/
Dec 11 10:10:19 <chkoehle>	no one keeps track of time at red hat so you could eat lunch normally and it'l be alright :)
Dec 11 10:10:21 <hukhan>	it will if you want it to 
Dec 11 10:10:22 <chkoehle>	+l
Dec 11 10:11:44 <chkoehle>	plus if you feel guilty about it, you can just use the refunded money from the go trains to buy food
Dec 11 10:12:18 <chkoehle>	or if you feel really guilty about it, eat and have a normal day and wfh when you get home
Dec 11 10:23:31 <lufimtse>	hukhan, I failed at Interact transfer
Dec 11 10:23:38 <lufimtse>	hukhan, I typed link intitially

Jan 16 16:45:11 <almac>	anyone interested in playing another 1v1 bracket? i was thinking we could do it like last time and just play the games whenever you have time during the week, and maybe see if we can keep it a bi-weekly/monthly thing, thoughts?
Jan 16 16:45:26 <lufimtse>	why no
Jan 16 16:45:27 <lufimtse>	why not
Jan 16 16:45:30 <lufimtse>	sounds like fun.
Jan 16 16:45:32 <almac>	"why no"
Jan 16 16:45:33 <almac>	ok.
Jan 16 16:45:58 <lufimtse>	although might be easier to use whiteboard I think
Jan 16 16:46:03 <lufimtse>	the online thing was kinda complicated
Jan 16 16:46:06 <lufimtse>	imho
Jan 16 16:47:25 <hukhan>	yeah sure
Jan 16 16:47:41 <hukhan>	I prefer the online thing though
Jan 16 16:48:06 <almac>	ill try to play more with the config for it, it'd be easier if you could self-report scores and use an account or something
Jan 16 16:48:15 <almac>	it's also got an API ... vilebot integration?
Jan 16 16:49:02 <lbullen>	almac++
Jan 16 16:49:05 <hukhan>	that'd be pretty cool
Jan 16 16:49:12 <hukhan>	something like !stats almac
Jan 16 16:49:18 <almac>	yeah okay there's a checkbox for reporting own scores

Jan 16 16:57:13 <chkoehle>	almac yes to 1v1
Jan 16 16:57:44 <lufimtse>	hmmm. I would argue that using challonge adds overhead. 
Jan 16 16:57:54 <lufimtse>	for like <8 of us.
Jan 16 16:58:03 <lufimtse>	just mho
Jan 16 16:58:14 <almac>	yeah but it keeps history

Jan 16 16:58:47 <chkoehle>	double elimination?
Jan 16 16:58:51 <chkoehle>	or 
Jan 16 16:58:52 <almac>	yeah, could be useful for future seeding?
Jan 16 16:58:59 <almac>	when we get another 9 bodies in the office
Jan 16 16:59:11 <almac>	yeah standard DE bracket
Jan 16 16:59:27 <chkoehle>	i lost to cchianel for some smash tourney a few months ago

Jan 23 16:28:50 <chkoehle_>	did you want to play a quick game or two
Jan 23 16:28:54 <chkoehle_>	i have to go soon
Jan 23 16:29:39 <chkoehle_>	since i wanted to have our Duel Of The Century™ so i can be ready for the Ultimate Battle Of The Century™ against alex
Jan 23 16:36:37 <lufimtse>	chkoehle_, hey
Jan 23 16:37:08 <lufimtse>	chkoehle_, today kinda running late with some work. I could play at around 5:20pm if you're still around.
Jan 23 18:51:50 <almac>	lufimtse, https://smashcords.com/smash-4/
Jan 23 18:52:08 <almac>	there should be a link to the Peach discord there, they should have some pretty technical guides and discussion
Jan 24 09:11:17 <chkoehle>	almac_ is there a samus guide there
Jan 24 09:16:26 <almac>	chkoehle, there should be a samus channel
Jan 24 09:16:41 <chkoehle>	i'm going to join it
Jan 24 11:34:21 <almac>	chkoehle, https://smash.gg/tournament/get-on-my-level-2018-canadian-smash-championships
Jan 24 11:34:35 <chkoehle>	awesome ty :D
Jan 24 11:34:51 <chkoehle>	> North's most hype national tournament
Jan 24 11:34:53 <chkoehle>	h y p e
Jan 24 11:35:11 <chkoehle>	how does it work
Jan 24 11:35:31 <chkoehle>	like i bring my own controller, get thrown into a massive pool, do my match, if i win i go on or else if i lose i get eliminated (double elimination)
Jan 24 11:35:43 <almac>	you fork over a lot of money, they seed you into the bracket, you lose and watch pro players all day
Jan 24 11:36:10 <chkoehle>	i am okay with this
Jan 24 11:37:14 <almac>	chkoehle, https://smash.gg/tournament/revenge-of-the-6ix-episode-iii-ssbm-smash4
Jan 24 11:37:23 <almac>	there's also that one, which is cheaper and local
Jan 24 11:37:31 <almac>	if you're interested in just trying the experience
Jan 24 11:37:50 <almac>	GOML attracts NA-wide players so it's neat to see the pros play
Jan 24 11:37:58 <chkoehle>	i love being in TO
Jan 24 11:38:19 <almac>	6ix would probably have the Toronto PR players and a couple notable pros (mistake & blacktwins most likely)
Jan 24 11:43:03 <chkoehle>	should i expect to get crushed in the first game
Jan 24 11:48:02 <almac>	depending on the bracket size, either yes or no
Jan 24 11:48:24 <almac>	if you're new you get last seed, so you'll get matched against first seed
Jan 24 11:48:51 <chkoehle>	how do they seed? random matches?
Jan 24 11:49:00 <almac>	but if the bracket is large enough, first seed will get a bye and two lowest seed players will play first and then the winner goes to play first seed
Jan 24 11:49:02 <chkoehle>	cause if i'm against #1 then i will get #rekt, but thats okay with me
Jan 24 11:49:14 <almac>	no it's based on the power rankings and history
Jan 24 11:49:40 <almac>	chkoehle, https://www.ssbwiki.com/Southern_Ontario_Power_Rankings#2017:_Season_2
Jan 24 11:49:59 <almac>	i know in BC they had a public spreadsheet with the W/L of every player who entered any tournament
Jan 24 11:50:10 <almac>	and used that to create their PR and elo rankings
Jan 24 11:50:18 <almac>	i'd assume toronto has similar somewhere
Jan 24 11:51:34 <chkoehle>	> Mistake is a Canadian Bayonetta main... he picked up Bayonetta and has become one of the best Bayonetta players in the world
Jan 24 11:51:39 <chkoehle>	oh man
Jan 24 11:51:51 <almac>	he came in 2nd at Genesis 5 last weekend
Jan 24 11:51:58 <chkoehle>	is that a huge tourney?
Jan 24 11:52:20 <almac>	took down the #2 global ranked player, along with Nairo and a ton of other players
Jan 24 11:52:25 <almac>	yeah its pretty huge
Jan 24 11:52:31 <chkoehle>	holy shit
Jan 24 11:52:40 <almac>	IIRC he placed top 15 in the world for 2017
Jan 24 11:53:04 <chkoehle>	maybe it would be cool to get that experience because it'd be neat to see just how far ahead some of these players are
Jan 24 11:53:06 <almac>	#13 yeah
Jan 24 11:53:27 <almac>	it's really neat, you see the game in 4D
Jan 24 11:53:44 <chkoehle>	so i assume we play 3 matches
Jan 24 11:53:47 <chkoehle>	or 2
Jan 24 11:53:53 <chkoehle>	or rather, first to win 2?
Jan 24 11:54:02 <almac>	tourneys are usually bo3 until top 48
Jan 24 11:54:31 <chkoehle>	i guess i will have to practice
Jan 24 11:56:51 <chkoehle>	my biggest issue is that i don't know what some people are capable of
Jan 24 11:57:05 <chkoehle>	i wonder if i should just play the common 10+ characters so i can see what they can do
Jan 24 11:57:27 <chkoehle>	knowing my luck i'll have someone do an odd character like dabuz and i will have to freestyle
Jan 24 11:58:03 <chkoehle>	hopefully samus will be an odd one for most people since only esam uses samus, and all the commentators for the streams constantly say how no one uses samus due to perceived bad ranking
Jan 24 11:58:22 <almac>	chkoehle, if you're actually interested in GOML or a larger event let me know, and I can walk you through some of that process
Jan 24 11:58:34 <almac>	the friendlies area is a great way to just learn from other people
Jan 24 11:58:51 <almac>	even higher skill players will learn off of you, because they'll learn tendencies etc.
Jan 24 11:58:52 <chkoehle>	yeah i legit want to go to these
Jan 24 11:59:12 <almac>	it's really fun and the community overall is pretty neat, because the events aren't helped or sponsored by nintendo
Jan 24 11:59:19 <almac>	they're just put on by people who like to game
Jan 24 12:01:27 <chkoehle>	is it locally in toronto?
Jan 24 12:01:43 <chkoehle>	it would also be cool to go back to uoft and wreck the smash club people
Jan 24 12:02:12 <chkoehle>	theres a CS student union and they play smash a fair amount
Jan 24 12:15:30 <cchianel>	Also, there is a karaoke night happening this friday at the CS student union
Jan 24 12:16:07 <cchianel>	https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/7sibmq/cssu_presents_karaoke_games_night/
Jan 24 12:51:58 <chkoehle|lunch>	smash bros in a few mins for those who are interested
Jan 24 14:50:23 <jpinkney>	anyone down for a game or two
Jan 24 14:52:49 <chkoehle>	if youre around at the end of the day
Jan 24 14:52:56 <chkoehle>	are you here until ~5 pm?
Jan 24 14:53:10 <jpinkney>	Yeah 
Jan 24 14:53:17 <chkoehle>	leo usually will play at that time too
Jan 24 14:58:03 <lufimtse>	I'm an at-end-of-day-I-can-play kinda guy ;-). 
Jan 24 14:58:17 <lufimtse>	ha ha
Jan 24 15:19:01 <hukhan>	lufimtse: also a just-finished-a-major-task-time-to-celebrate-via-smash kinda guy too 
Jan 24 15:19:38 <lufimtse>	hukhan, :-3.  Smash is like *. Solution to everything.
Jan 24 15:19:56 <hukhan>	hahahaha
Jan 25 10:21:19 <almac>	@all (wish that would work in here ..) I'm still hoping to start a bi-weekly bracket if you guys are interested, which would start on the monday with weeks containing the 1st and 15th day of the month .. so next monday would start one. link - http://challonge.com/rht_feb_1_2018
Jan 25 10:21:52 <almac>	in an attempt to make the site easy to find .. we can use a url that features the month name, the biweekly number for that month (1 or 2), and then the year
Jan 25 10:22:56 <hukhan>	awesome
Jan 25 10:23:02 <hukhan>	everyone sign up >:|
Jan 25 10:23:08 <chkoehle>	hukhan did you sign up with a new account or did almac add you manually
Jan 25 10:23:15 <hukhan>	new acc
Jan 25 10:23:20 <chkoehle>	if you signed up did you use your redhat email or should i make a throwaway 10 minute mail one
Jan 25 10:23:23 <almac>	i gave everyone permissions to edit scores
Jan 25 10:23:34 <almac>	so if you make an account, it'll be easy to keep the bracket up to date
Jan 25 11:51:39 <chkoehle>	wtf 10minutemail died

Jan 26 14:31:54 <chkoehle>	this is what i meant to draw earlier
Jan 26 14:32:12 <hukhan>	hahahahahaha
Jan 26 14:32:27 <chkoehle>	maybe i just hit a skill cap cause i need to play more
Jan 26 14:32:41 <chkoehle>	it feels like i naturally grew a lot and then plateau'd
Jan 26 14:32:46 <hukhan>	I think you just need to play people at your level or higher
Jan 26 14:32:50 <chkoehle>	idk how to properly type "plateau"
Jan 26 14:33:36 <chkoehle>	yeah, luckily i get those at the office :D but it would be neat to play an insane person
Jan 26 14:33:40 <chkoehle>	just to get wrecked
Jan 26 14:33:42 <chkoehle>	and humbled 
Jan 26 14:33:43 <hukhan>	whenever I feel like someone is reading me too easily, I feel forced to try new things
Jan 26 14:34:02 <almac>	yeah we have our own little office metagame
Jan 26 14:34:41 <almac>	so we get comfortable with each others tendencies hah makes it easier to read
Jan 26 14:34:53 <hukhan>	yeah!
Jan 26 14:35:50 <chkoehle>	i found out today that knowing only how 3-4 characters play hurts me a lot
Jan 26 14:36:01 <chkoehle>	zelda was hard as f
Jan 26 14:36:13 <chkoehle>	(or i suck, that probably is a key component)
Jan 26 14:36:16 <hukhan>	yeah...playing other characters helps
Jan 26 14:36:25 <chkoehle>	i should just pick one character a week
Jan 26 14:36:27 <hukhan>	I don't because toon link
Jan 26 14:37:10 <chkoehle>	i am about to do something very bad

Jan 29 10:28:35 <chkoehle>	yes ^
Jan 29 10:28:43 <chkoehle>	i also wonder if we can get admin for this channel
Jan 29 10:28:46 <chkoehle>	idk how we lost it
Jan 29 10:29:10 <chkoehle>	i might PM the internal admins asking for access
Jan 29 10:29:32 <chkoehle>	i should register with nickserv and then properly take it
Jan 29 10:29:52 <almac>	I tried with chanserv
Jan 29 10:30:00 <almac>	it said i needed to be admin right now to register it
Jan 29 10:30:02 <almac>	RIP
Jan 29 10:30:15 <chkoehle>	can we possibly get #smashTO or something
Jan 29 10:30:20 <almac>	yeah potentially
Jan 29 10:30:22 <chkoehle>	is there a proper way to do it right
Jan 29 10:30:34 <chkoehle>	i might as well auth with nickserv
Jan 29 10:30:43 <chkoehle>	i am going to carry stuff
Jan 29 10:30:44 <almac>	chkoehle, https://engineering.redhat.com/irc-services.txt

Jan 29 12:28:47 <chkoehle>	forgot its between 12-1
Jan 29 12:34:57 <cchianel|wfh>	We should have sm4shbot narrates the matches when they are happening
Jan 29 12:35:16 <cchianel|wfh>	And automatically uploads the video to youtube
Jan 29 12:40:02 <chkoehle>	sm4sh
Jan 29 12:48:06 <cchianel|wfh>	sm4sh -> s m4 sh -> sh m4 s -> use a shell to invoke the GNU preprocessor on file s

Jan 31 12:10:24 *	You are now known as lufimtse
Jan 31 12:20:29 <chkoehle>	lufimtse h
Jan 31 12:20:30 <chkoehle>	i
Jan 31 13:42:04 <chkoehle>	almac should cchianel be advanced from his bracket?
Jan 31 13:42:31 <almac>	yeah jkang forfeited that first game right?
Jan 31 13:43:03 <almac>	he was scared to fight the maid of destruction
Jan 31 13:43:10 <chkoehle>	i would be too
Jan 31 13:43:21 <almac>	also another technicality then,
Jan 31 13:43:31 <almac>	i'm using the W/L to calculate ELO rankings for future seedings
Jan 31 13:43:47 <almac>	does this count as a legit loss? or a technicality forfeit?
Jan 31 13:43:53 <almac>	i'm game for either or
Jan 31 13:44:38 <chkoehle>	does having forfeits make the calculations harder?
Jan 31 13:44:41 <chkoehle>	idk if he has any past data
Jan 31 13:44:54 <chkoehle>	some brainstorming: he's a solid player so if he only has a loss then he will basically wreck everyone in the lower tiers
Jan 31 13:45:06 <chkoehle>	then again his ranking right now is basically ??? if he has no data, so i wonder if its the same
Jan 31 13:45:24 <chkoehle>	part of me wants to lean towards forfeit = special case, however if it simplifies calculations it could be a loss too
Jan 31 13:45:29 <chkoehle>	im not sure how the official rules handle it
Jan 31 13:45:33 <almac>	eh i'll just count it, consider it like if you started the game and just ran off the stage
Jan 31 13:45:53 <almac>	like if you queued up to play a LoL ranked game and just didn't play, you'd still get an L
Jan 31 13:46:13 <chkoehle>	sounds good for me too :D
Jan 31 13:46:49 <almac>	this opens the bracket up nicely, two matches can be played without jie/thauser being here
Jan 31 13:47:33 <chkoehle>	i can play against tom the day he gets back
Jan 31 13:47:40 <chkoehle>	though idk when he will come into the office next
Jan 31 13:47:47 <almac>	yeah kind of iffy
Jan 31 13:47:48 <hukhan>	I feel like forfeit shouldn't affect elo imo
Jan 31 13:48:02 <almac>	hmm yeah im on the fence about it
Jan 31 13:48:19 <almac>	i can still undo it until the next time jkang or maidofdestruction plays
Jan 31 13:48:45 <almac>	i think for brackets sake, we should try to have X number of winners bracket games done by a certain day in the week
Jan 31 13:48:59 <almac>	but since it's the first one and im not too sure of timing, im not sure what day that should be :/
Jan 31 13:49:04 <almac>	just play it by ear this time
Jan 31 13:53:33 <chkoehle>	i assume a ton of them will happen on friday
Jan 31 13:53:51 <almac>	yeah friday could be a good day
Jan 31 13:54:20 <almac>	id rather just not have everything crammed and feel like we're forcing people to play
Jan 31 13:55:36 <chkoehle>	same
Jan 31 13:57:08 <hukhan>	I totally forced lbullen and clessard to play today >_> 
Jan 31 13:57:12 <hukhan>	no regrets
Jan 31 13:58:18 <chkoehle>	good... good...
Jan 31 14:05:59 <almac>	nah that was some good lunch entertainment
Jan 31 14:48:46 <chkoehle>	did anyone want to play a quick 1 or 2 games
Jan 31 14:54:37 <jpinkney>	chkoehle I will
Jan 31 14:54:45 <chkoehle>	jpinkney want to in ~6 minutes?
Feb 01 08:55:31 <cchianel>	leo won 2-0
Feb 01 08:57:26 <cchianel>	(damn, leo is undefeated)
Feb 01 08:57:41 <chkoehle>	dont worry, i will avenge the maid of destruction
Feb 01 08:57:48 <chkoehle>	plus you are in the losers bracket now, you can still recover
Feb 01 08:57:56 <cchianel>	*Maid of Minor Destruction
Feb 01 09:25:53 <hukhan>	match 6 results: 0-2, to hukhan
Feb 01 09:27:48 <almac>	nice
Feb 01 09:28:22 <almac>	so when thauser comes in, we'll sit him down for like an hour and cycle through opponents
Feb 01 09:28:37 <almac>	it'll be like a buffet where they bring food to your table
Feb 01 09:28:41 <almac>	but instead of food, its smash
Feb 01 09:29:13 <chkoehle>	does clessard move ahead in the tourney?
Feb 01 09:29:19 <chkoehle>	since i assume jkang forfeits
Feb 01 09:30:16 <almac>	we could ask the jkang, his words was that he forfeited his match to the maid of destruction
Feb 01 09:33:58 <chkoehle>	would make it more interesting if he just forfeited the first match :D
Feb 01 09:34:01 <chkoehle>	then more heated losers round
Feb 01 09:34:13 <almac>	yeah straight to losers without taking an elo hit?
Feb 01 09:34:34 <chkoehle>	also do you remember who won last time?
Feb 01 09:34:42 <almac>	ipun won last time
Feb 01 09:35:20 <almac>	game 3 dreamland last stock, i witch twisted into the bottom of dreamland
Feb 01 09:35:30 <chkoehle>	pineapple be damned
Feb 01 09:35:36 <almac>	always pineapple
Feb 01 09:35:42 <chkoehle>	was it close?
Feb 01 09:35:45 <chkoehle>	i missed that game :(
Feb 01 09:35:46 <almac>	very
Feb 01 09:35:49 <chkoehle>	aww
Feb 01 09:35:56 <almac>	that was a really good time
Feb 01 09:36:10 <almac>	i actually learned DK for that series
Feb 01 09:36:19 <chkoehle>	are you going to include those matches into elo calcs?
Feb 01 09:36:25 <almac>	if anyone needs a decent way to kill Cloud, it's DK
Feb 01 09:36:29 <almac>	no
Feb 01 09:36:36 <almac>	start fresh from this latest one
Feb 01 09:37:26 <chkoehle>	excellent
Feb 01 14:18:23 <hukhan>	smash @ 5!?!?!
Feb 01 14:18:30 <almac>	smash5?!
Feb 01 14:41:44 <almac>	whoa, the maid of destruction is now only the maid of minor destruction?
Feb 01 14:43:48 <chkoehle>	if he loses does he become the maid of dim7 destruction?
Feb 01 14:44:12 <chkoehle>	nvm for some reason i thought i saw 'major', then 'minor'
Feb 01 14:44:20 <chkoehle>	just realized that might be too cryptic
Feb 01 14:44:50 <chkoehle>	30+ second compile times to debug sucks
Feb 01 14:45:47 <hukhan>	huh, so who does almac play next
Feb 01 14:45:56 <hukhan>	I'm confused by this setup
Feb 01 14:46:24 <chkoehle>	he plays clessard or jkang
Feb 01 14:46:40 <hukhan>	didn't jkang forfeit?
Feb 01 14:46:50 <chkoehle>	he might have only forfeited one game
Feb 01 14:46:58 <hukhan>	o

Feb 12 12:28:19 <almac>	yo! So technically the first bracket was supposed to end today, and today would start the next biweekly. But there were timing issues that came up .. so I was wondering what people thought about having a soft 2-day time limit per matches?
Feb 12 12:28:26 <almac>	and the bracket would look something like: http://challonge.com/rht_feb_2_2018
Feb 12 12:29:39 <almac>	also cchianel, let me know when you want to play our game
Feb 12 12:30:51 <cchianel>	almac, whenever you are ready
Feb 12 12:31:05 <almac>	cchianel, now?
Feb 12 12:31:12 <cchianel>	almac, sure
Feb 12 12:38:33 <cchianel>	almac|lunch won 2-0, he be facing lufimtse next
Feb 12 13:16:48 <hukhan>	I have no preference, 2 day is fine with me
Feb 12 14:15:59 <lufimtse>	almac, lemme know when up for 1:1
Feb 12 14:16:05 <lufimtse>	maybe before heading out
Feb 12 14:16:13 <almac>	like around 5?
Feb 13 10:05:37 <almac>	Yo! So I'm a day late in getting this next bi-weekly started, but I think we should be able to power through it. I've kept the entrants to people who are usually in the office (jkang is potentially home the rest of the week, and thauser is .. thauser). So we shouldn't really have to worry much about timing.

Feb 15 14:00:23 <chkoehle>	just realiezd: cchianel and hukhan forgot to play their match

Feb 16 14:24:45 <hukhan>	smash@5???
Feb 16 14:25:13 <hukhan>	team battles are dope
Feb 16 14:27:09 <cchianel>	hukhan, 1 v 1 me?
Feb 16 14:27:17 <hukhan>	sure
Feb 16 14:38:12 <almac>	team battles for upcoming biweekly?
Feb 16 14:39:36 <lbullen>	almac++
Feb 16 14:39:56 <xcchianel>	hukhan won 2-1
Feb 16 14:39:57 <almac>	i was thinking of alternative brackets to keep things fun/fresh, team battles would be fun
Feb 16 14:40:05 <almac>	xcchianel, thanks, sounds close!
Feb 16 14:41:45 <almac>	so for this one, we need jpinkey vs. rubao (should probably get him in this channel), with the winner facing lufimtse (and the winner of that playing hukhan)
Feb 16 14:41:54 <almac>	but that'll have to wait for tuesday
Feb 16 14:42:55 <chkoehle>	almac how would the teams be assembled? randteams?
Feb 16 14:43:00 <chkoehle>	elo?
Feb 16 14:43:07 <almac>	elo would be easy
Feb 16 14:43:20 <almac>	or we could leave it up to promposals
Feb 16 14:43:29 <chkoehle>	promp
Feb 16 14:43:29 <almac>	'be my player 2 plz'
Feb 16 14:43:45 <chkoehle>	while they are kneeling down
Feb 16 14:43:54 <chkoehle>	open up a small box, smash controller inside
Feb 16 14:43:56 <rubao>	hi
Feb 16 14:43:59 <chkoehle>	hello rubao 
Feb 16 14:44:00 <almac>	oh hi der
Feb 16 14:44:14 <chkoehle>	i really wish we could get OP status to set the topics in here
Feb 16 14:44:22 <hukhan>	can't we just create a new channel
Feb 16 14:44:25 *	rubao got invited by hukhan
Feb 16 14:44:27 <chkoehle>	yeah

Feb 16 14:44:49 <almac>	yeah we could make a new one
Feb 16 14:44:52 <almac>	that'd be easier
Feb 16 14:44:57 <chkoehle>	i could recover it from my red hat email but i have to find out how
Feb 16 14:45:00 <almac>	could automate a bot to do this dirty work
Feb 16 14:45:18 <chkoehle>	it would also be nice to have the bot do automatic reminders
Feb 16 14:45:24 <chkoehle>	"you should play today or tomorrow"
Feb 16 14:45:27 <almac>	#Smash4TO
Feb 16 14:45:27 <chkoehle>	so games get done
Feb 16 14:45:48 <chkoehle>	i need to recover my account
Feb 16 14:45:48 <almac>	git done
Feb 16 14:46:07 <almac>	that should be a command when you end of life a repo
Feb 16 14:46:12 <chkoehle>	ha

Feb 16 14:55:21 <chkoehle>	lufimtse are you logged in
Feb 16 14:55:23 <chkoehle>	into irc*

Feb 16 14:55:53 <lufimtse>	nm
Feb 16 14:56:10 <lufimtse>	looks like challonge (LeonidasU) is actually linked to leospostbox@gmail.com
Feb 16 14:56:36 <lufimtse>	so proper one is:   eamil:leospostbox@gmail.com    Username:LeonidasU
