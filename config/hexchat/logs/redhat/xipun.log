Aug 29 12:12:35 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79948/
Aug 29 13:27:26 <ipun>	wait did you do this already for me>
Aug 29 13:27:27 <ipun>	i cant tell
Aug 29 14:59:55 <lufimtse>	btw
Aug 29 14:59:56 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79948/
Aug 29 15:00:00 <lufimtse>	you know much about it?
Aug 29 15:00:06 <lufimtse>	alex talked about backport
Aug 29 15:00:11 <lufimtse>	is that what you're working on?
Aug 29 15:01:20 <ipun>	yeah that was what i was working on
Aug 29 15:01:25 <lufimtse>	ok
Aug 29 15:01:27 <ipun>	looks like Dani went ahead and backported it before i could
Aug 29 15:02:40 <ipun>	lufimtse also looks like it cant mount right away, tgives that same error
Aug 29 15:02:57 <ipun>	im going to see if its possible to just run the script a little later after rebooting
Aug 29 15:03:09 <lufimtse>	Sometimes the error is thrown but mount works.
Aug 29 15:03:16 <lufimtse>	the script first force-unmounts, then remounts
Aug 29 15:03:22 <lufimtse>	the error sometimes comes from force unmount.
Aug 29 15:03:37 <lufimtse>	the force unmount flushes out broken pipes
Aug 29 15:08:23 <ipun>	good news is @reboot works
Aug 29 15:08:36 <ipun>	bad news is it isnt mounting the time it calls it
Aug 29 15:08:40 <ipun>	log shows its outputting read: Connection reset by peer
Aug 29 15:08:50 <ipun>	im assuming its because its running too early
Aug 29 15:08:57 <lufimtse>	does it work later?
Aug 29 15:09:11 <ipun>	well if i call ./mount.sh manually later it works
Aug 29 15:09:16 <ipun>	im trying to see if i can set a delay after reboot to run
Aug 29 15:09:26 <lufimtse>	might be that crontab runs under root
Aug 29 15:09:34 <lufimtse>	this needs to be ran under user.
Aug 29 15:09:37 <lufimtse>	but IDK
Aug 29 15:09:40 <lufimtse>	just a wild guess
Aug 29 15:12:42 <ipun>	k yeah i fixwed it
Aug 29 15:12:48 <ipun>	just needed a delay like i expected
Aug 29 15:12:49 <lufimtse>	hmm
Aug 29 15:12:52 <lufimtse>	nixe
Aug 29 15:12:57 <lufimtse>	did you do a sleep?
Aug 29 15:13:03 <ipun>	yup
Aug 29 15:13:08 <lufimtse>	nice
Aug 29 15:13:26 <ipun>	5 seconds, i could probably go lower but migth as well keep it to something worthwhile
