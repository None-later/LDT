Sep 27 09:22:45 <mbenitez>	hello Leo
Sep 27 09:22:52 <lufimtse>	hello
Sep 27 09:23:03 <mbenitez>	I had an errand to run this morning but I'll be in the office after lunch
Sep 27 09:23:10 <lufimtse>	kk
Sep 27 09:23:15 <mbenitez>	we can have our 1:1 then if that's fine with you
Sep 27 09:26:29 <lufimtse>	Btw, today I'm running a guest lecture with Jie Kang on "Open Source" for CSC209 (second year 'C development' course) between 1-2 pm. Then again another one at 4-5pm. So idea was that I'll just stay at UofT and work remotley in between. (I came a bit earlier to work today and will work a bit after to make up for missing time). Should we do 1:1 sometime tomorrow or friday?
Sep 27 09:27:10 <mbenitez>	that is great :)
Sep 27 09:27:17 <mbenitez>	no worries then
Sep 27 09:27:39 <mbenitez>	let me see how tomorrow goes, we may be able to squeeze it then
Sep 27 09:27:57 <mbenitez>	if not I'll have to postpone, sorry for the change of plans :(
Sep 27 09:37:32 <lufimtse>	ok
