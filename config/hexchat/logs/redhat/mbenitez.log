Sep 27 09:23:03 <mbenitez>	I had an errand to run this morning but I'll be in the office after lunch
Sep 27 09:23:10 <lufimtse>	kk
Sep 27 09:23:15 <mbenitez>	we can have our 1:1 then if that's fine with you
Sep 27 09:26:29 <lufimtse>	Btw, today I'm running a guest lecture with Jie Kang on "Open Source" for CSC209 (second year 'C development' course) between 1-2 pm. Then again another one at 4-5pm. So idea was that I'll just stay at UofT and work remotley in between. (I came a bit earlier to work today and will work a bit after to make up for missing time). Should we do 1:1 sometime tomorrow or friday?
Sep 27 09:27:10 <mbenitez>	that is great :)
Sep 27 09:27:17 <mbenitez>	no worries then
Sep 27 09:27:39 <mbenitez>	let me see how tomorrow goes, we may be able to squeeze it then
Sep 27 09:27:57 <mbenitez>	if not I'll have to postpone, sorry for the change of plans :(

Oct 14 15:58:33 <lufimtse>	yea
Oct 14 15:58:38 <mbenitez>	re: backpack, unfortunately we can't approve this purchase
Oct 14 15:59:00 <mbenitez>	the backpacks are not given to everybody, not sure why, I've mostly seen this for US
Oct 14 15:59:06 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 14 15:59:08 <lufimtse>	ok.
Oct 14 15:59:16 <mbenitez>	I'd recommend 2 things: ask Lisa
Oct 14 15:59:42 <mbenitez>	since she orders laptops for the office she may know how common this practice is / what we'd need to do
Oct 14 15:59:59 <lufimtse>	ok, will do.
Oct 14 16:00:15 <mbenitez>	second option, contact the organizer of your NHO about this, maybe you get a belated exception?
Oct 14 16:00:48 <mbenitez>	if it comes down to our dept paying I won't be able to authorize it but you don't lose anything by asking
Oct 14 16:01:12 <mbenitez>	Also wanted to ask if you got any answers about your doctor query
Oct 14 16:02:31 <lufimtse>	I see. Yea, I got a bunch of replies, I'll have to work my way through those to find one. (I'm in perfect health :-), this is just a precaution for future).
Oct 14 16:02:50 <mbenitez>	good to know you got leads
Oct 14 16:03:13 <mbenitez>	fwiw when I got to TO I was in a similar position, I used this: http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/
Oct 14 16:03:38 <mbenitez>	the need a doctor session helps you find those taking new patients [but you don't have any referral]
Oct 14 16:04:18 <lufimtse>	Thank you for the tip.

May 04 14:17:10 <lufimtse>	one about what the eclipse team does
May 04 14:17:20 <lufimtse>	in this case it's 'what eclipse team does'
May 04 14:17:24 <lufimtse>	ok, me and Ian can do it.

May 04 14:17:33 <lufimtse>	yea
May 04 14:17:51 <lufimtse>	maybe I'll ping if Roland wants to join, since the new intern would mostly be doing platform.ui stuff.
May 04 14:17:55 <mbenitez>	if you want to ask Roland that'd be fine, but may become a crowd of presenters :P
