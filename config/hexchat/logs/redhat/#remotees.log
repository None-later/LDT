Jul 10 13:51:20 <dgilbert>	elynn[m]: I'm no expert, but no not necessarily
Jul 10 13:51:31 <dgilbert>	elynn[m]: It's asymmetric encryption - everyone has two keys
Jul 10 13:51:52 <dgilbert>	elynn[m]: You encrypt with someones public key, but only the person holding the private key can decrypt
Jul 10 13:56:05 <elynn[m]>	dgilbert: thanks for that, that makes sense
Jul 10 14:32:27 <elynn[m]>	dgilbert: I had the recipient re-encrypt with my public key and send back to me.

Jul 16 09:41:00 <kashyap>	If people are sick of the latest 'memo-list' thread that shall not be named ...
Jul 16 09:41:30 <kashyap>	... here is one email from the author of that quirk ('pity da fool') that will put an end: http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/618441
Jul 16 09:42:22 <kashyap>	It's a fantastic email with great reflection.  The email needs an attention span of 5-7 minutes, well worth it.
Jul 16 09:58:40 <dmarlin>	kashyap: or the benefit of those of us who don't subscribe to/follow memo-list, can you provide a short (one line) summary of what instigated this thread, just to provide context for the quirk email?  thanks.
Jul 16 09:58:59 <dmarlin>	s/or the/for the/
Jul 16 10:00:30 <dgilbert>	someone got offended by a joke from one of the irc bots
Jul 16 10:00:53 <dmarlin>	dgilbert: thanks.  
Jul 16 10:01:09 <dmarlin>	dgilbert: I kind of feel left out now, since I don't think a 
Jul 16 10:01:25 <dmarlin>	'experienced' any of those 'jokes'
Jul 16 10:01:44 <dmarlin>	and now they are gone...    :-/
Jul 16 10:03:53 <mjw>	ah, yeah, self-deprecating jokes don't always translate well. They only work in a small community where people all know each other.
Jul 16 10:05:33 <dmarlin>	kind of funny, for a company that constantly says we want to 'maintain our culture', we seem to be doing a lot to change it, if not erase it entirely.
Jul 16 10:05:46 <mjw>	I used to work on libre-java alternatives when the reference implementation was very much proprietary.
Jul 16 10:05:55 <mjw>	It was fun if we ourselves made those jokes
Jul 16 10:06:06 <mjw>	but when someone outside our community made them...
Jul 16 10:07:54 <smooge>	meh some culture is best thrown to the trash heap of history. the jokes weren't funny, they were cheap shots which might be funny once and only once.
Jul 16 10:09:21 <dgilbert>	it's very difficult to scale humour
Jul 16 10:10:09 <seii>	It's also very difficult to keep humor
Jul 16 10:11:20 <dmarlin>	seii: precisely.  because almost anything someone finds funny, someone else will find offensive.
Jul 16 10:12:27 <seii>	It's hard when you know your sense of humor is relatively offensive, too. I can't really defend anything that I find humorous because I know others are likely offended by what I found funny.
Jul 16 10:12:51 <seii>	"If you were me this would be hilarious" really doesn't work, as nice as that would be
Jul 16 10:16:38 <dmarlin>	seii: heh... personalized humor... this joke is only for me, because only I find it funny.  No sharing!    ;-)
Jul 16 10:17:13 <seii>	dmarlin: But then it *gasp* wouldn't be an open-source joke!
Jul 16 10:17:48 <dmarlin>	seii:  :-)
Jul 16 10:18:31 <dgilbert>	dmarlin: Well, those types of jokes could leave people feeling like fish out of water
Jul 16 10:19:57 <dmarlin>	dgilbert: hmm... being a 'fish person' (Marlin), I'm offended by that comment.
Jul 16 10:20:00 <dmarlin>	  ;-)
Jul 16 10:20:05 <kashyap>	dmarlin: Hi, was AFK, so you got the gist above.
Jul 16 10:20:21 <dmarlin>	kashyap: I did.  thanks.
Jul 16 10:21:15 *	kashyap wonders what on earth can we do improve the _signal_ on the noisy beast that is 'memo-list'.
Jul 16 10:21:29 <dgilbert>	dmarlin: I know :-)
Jul 16 10:21:31 <kashyap>	I really also wonder how are New Hires introduced to that list
Jul 16 10:21:45 *	kashyap is nearing 10 years at RHT, so forgot how they do the New Hire Orientation on these topics
Jul 16 10:21:49 <dmarlin>	kashyap: I gave up on memo-list years ago... which was my only 'solution'
Jul 16 10:22:29 <kashyap>	dmarlin: Nod; I very selectively read, and also I read specific people that I know are full of signal.
Jul 16 10:22:30 <dmarlin>	kashyap: I miss a lot, but just didn't have time to filter it
Jul 16 10:23:08 <dgilbert>	dmarlin: You don't miss much
Jul 16 10:23:09 <kashyap>	Sometimes I do find useful stuff there, like the recent talk about Security issues and how RHT handles embargoes with open source communities
Jul 16 10:23:28 <kashyap>	But yes, in general I do agree with dgilbert there.  A _ton_ of noise and utter crap.
Jul 16 10:24:17 <kashyap>	For the record,  dgilbert _is_ one of the people who contribute to the good quality, so I appreciate his courage to deal with the list.
Jul 16 10:24:44 <dmarlin>	kashyap: maybe if there wee a 'moderator' who could select the 'useful stuff' and post it to another (less noisy) list
Jul 16 10:24:54 <dmarlin>	s/wee/were/
Jul 16 10:25:09 *	kashyap hopes that 'moderator' can reimburse anti-depressants :P
Jul 16 10:25:11 *	dmarlin need to watch his typing
Jul 16 10:25:18 <dmarlin>	heh...
Jul 16 10:25:38 <kashyap>	Is that joke acceptable on 'memo-list'?  I will not think about it...
Jul 16 10:25:53 <dmarlin>	likely not...   :-(
Jul 16 10:26:12 <kashyap>	To hell with that.  That's the point others raised -- you shouldn't _also_ feel like you're walking on egg shells.
Jul 16 10:26:14 <dgilbert>	dmarlin: Obviously the answer is to train an AI on the memo-list and make it select stuff
Jul 16 10:26:20 <dmarlin>	maybe just make memo-list a 'no humor zone'
Jul 16 10:26:35 <dmarlin>	dgilbert: sounds like a plan...
Jul 16 10:26:42 <kashyap>	Simo Sorce (another veteran RHTer) wrote a very nice email on achieving balance there.
Jul 16 10:26:45 <dmarlin>	dgilbert: but then, who controls the AI
Jul 16 10:27:11 <scott>	kashyap, as a new hire as of April, they mostly just warn you that it goes out to all the company
Jul 16 10:27:26 <scott>	and suggest that you think before you post. not much coverage really
Jul 16 10:27:52 <kashyap>	scott: I see.  Do they give any other pointers about _what_ constitutes on-topic, etc?
Jul 16 10:27:58 <scott>	kashyap, I don't recall that, no.
Jul 16 10:28:23 <kashyap>	Nod; yeah, the general off-list email I send is there is a nice internal blog post by Jon Masters about posting 'guidelines'
Jul 16 10:28:26 <kashyap>	Damned if I could find it
Jul 16 10:28:40 <scott>	I was warned about it before starting. It has some interesting posts, but I mostly just see it as an eternal flamewar at the moment.
Jul 16 10:29:29 <dmarlin>	scott: that's the standard, as I recall  ( eternal flamewar )
Jul 16 10:29:49 <scott>	dmarlin, yeah. I can get that from the rest of the internet, I don't need to double down on it at work. :)
Jul 16 10:30:00 <dmarlin>	:)
Jul 16 10:30:49 <kashyap>	FWIW, my thumb rule is to aggressively mark everything as 'read' (thanks to `mutt`'s Ctrl+r) and filter by topic
Jul 16 12:12:08 *	rgb gave up on memo-list after one month, more than 5 years ago.  Though not as high as LKML, that was just too much volume...
Jul 16 12:15:05 <rgb>	maybe there should be an engineering-memo-list and a sales-memo-list, etc...  (I'm not entirely serious here...)
Jul 16 12:15:41 *	rgb ponders that he has more in common with the engineers in Delhi than he does with the sales guys in Ottawa.
Jul 16 12:21:31 <scott>	I haven't unsubscribed yet, it's sort of like a car crash..I can't look away.
Jul 16 12:21:32 <mason>	kashyap: I added signal!
Jul 16 12:21:48 <mason>	bbiab
Jul 16 12:22:15 <seii>	mason: Main screen turn on?
Jul 16 12:22:43 <raoul>	I take a look when I need a break from everything else... and I don't read everything
Jul 16 12:28:34 <rgb>	scott: I haven't unsubscribed either, but I don't look unless someone mentions a specific message.
Jul 16 12:29:35 *	rgb is a pakrat, mother was a librarian, step-mother also a librarian...
Jul 16 13:08:21 <zul>	rgb: there are sales guys in ottawa?
Jul 16 13:20:36 <rgb>	zul: yup, they outnumber the tech guys.  there was one sales guy here for donkey's years before I started, then two of us engineers started and for a while the engineers outnumbered the sales guys, but now the sales guys outnumber the engineers.  We're all remote.
Jul 16 13:21:27 <zul>	rgb: who is the other tech in ottawa?
Jul 16 13:28:53 <rgb>	zul: lcapitulino.  codonnel started same day as me, but he's elsewhere in Ontario, so is pabelanger
Jul 16 13:29:14 <zul>	rgb: nify add one more to your list 
Jul 16 13:43:56 <rgb>	zul: you here now too?
Jul 16 13:44:14 <zul>	rgb: for the past couple of weeks :)
Jul 16 13:44:15 <rgb>	you on fche's map?
Jul 16 13:44:20 <zul>	rgb: yep
Jul 16 13:44:46 <rgb>	zul: cool!  might be time for another rhatters meetup...
Jul 16 13:44:58 <zul>	rgb: coolio
Jul 16 13:46:40 <rgb>	lunch!
Jul 16 16:29:37 <elynn[m]>	Do we have any sort of referral system for positions in PnT?
Jul 16 16:29:41 <elynn[m]>	I am in IT and don't think we do here
Jul 16 16:30:54 <elynn[m]>	I have a former colleague interested in https://us-redhat.icims.com/jobs/62631/principal-software-engineer---kubernetes-operator%2C-sdk/job
Jul 16 16:30:55 <mmccune>	elynn[m]: I believe every open position at redhat for a full time spot offers a referral bonus, department doesn't matter
Jul 16 16:31:24 <elynn[m]>	mmccune: thanks, that makes more sense now, I think most spots in IT are contractor spots, not FTE. 
Jul 16 16:31:41 <mmccune>	yeah, all FTE are eligible

Jul 16 16:32:03 <mmccune>	FAQ : https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1170055

Jul 16 16:32:51 <mmccune>	https://referrals.redhat.com/#/job/jobdetail/62631
Jul 16 16:33:26 <elynn[m]>	thanks mmccune 
Jul 16 16:33:44 <elynn[m]>	I am not an FTE, so I guess he is on his own
Jul 16 16:34:47 <elynn[m]>	Wonder how I could at least put in a recommendation or endorsement for the candidate. How can I find out who to do that with for that position I wonder?
Jul 16 16:35:17 <mmccune>	elynn[m]: onesec
Jul 16 16:38:51 <mmccune>	elynn[m]: Hiring Manager: Sebastien Pahl spahl@redhat.com , recruiter: Dwight Edson dedson@redhat.com, just send email with your recommendation + resume/cv
Jul 16 16:39:45 <elynn[m]>	Nice, thank you mmccune 
Jul 16 17:01:03 <bcotton>	mmccune: how did you find the hiring manager and recruiter's names?
Jul 16 17:01:49 <mmccune>	bcotton: talked to a recruiter who I work with often
Jul 16 17:05:06 <bcotton>	ah okay. i wasn't sure if there was a more public way of seeing that
Jul 16 17:06:28 <mmccune>	afaik, nope
Jul 16 17:07:34 <bcotton>	dang. that's one thing that i really liked about Microsoft's internal system: it showed you who the hiring manager is (and a few other items of interest)
Jul 16 17:08:07 <mmccune>	yeah, i dont know why we wouldnt have that available internally
Jul 18 09:51:27 <kashyap>	Oh dear, those MBs of "cute" files on 'memo-list'.
Jul 18 09:52:11 <mhayden>	kashyap: awwww
Jul 18 09:52:17 <kashyap>	:D
Jul 18 09:52:57 <kashyap>	I couldn't resist and sent a somewhat strong (and constructive, I hope) reply (asking to raise the quality of discourse).  Hope I won't reap the whirlwind...
Jul 18 10:01:09 *	rgb would be reading it with mutt, so would be blissfully unaware of "cute" files unless they were ASCII-art.  ;-)
Jul 18 10:02:27 <juneau>	rgb: /me is thinking of going the (Neo)Mutt route...but what do you use for calendaring?
Jul 18 10:03:36 <dgilbert>	juneau: I just keep the google calendar web page open for the calendar
Jul 18 10:04:05 <rgb>	juneau: I was using gcal, or just using calendar.google.com open
Jul 18 10:04:41 *	juneau is (still) looking for the MUA that sucks the least
Jul 18 10:04:56 <rgb>	juneau: in fact, I'm halfway between mutt and neomutt...  mutt won't do sidebars, neomutt won't do kerberos...
Jul 18 10:05:18 <rgb>	unless neomutt has been fixed recently...
Jul 18 10:06:15 <dgilbert>	rgb: Which sidebars? The mutt in f28 has a folder sidebar
Jul 18 10:06:17 <rgb>	there was another mutt derivative that did both and I've failed to figure out what it was...
Jul 18 10:06:32 <dgilbert>	rgb: I think the neomutt is slowly feeding it upstream
Jul 18 10:06:40 <rgb>	dgilbert: I'm not on f28 yet...
Jul 18 10:07:08 <rgb>	I had that impression that mutt is catching up...
Jul 18 10:07:36 <rgb>	the mutt that did both a couple of years ago was in epel or something...
Jul 18 10:10:06 <kashyap>	rgb: Right, I'm using `mutt`, too.
Jul 18 10:10:22 <kashyap>	rgb: But you can't (?) avoid downloading all those MBs of files
Jul 18 10:10:34 <kashyap>	juneau: Look no further, it is `mutt`
Jul 18 10:10:40 <kashyap>	It's even its motto
Jul 18 10:10:56 <kashyap>	    "All mail clients suck. This one just sucks less." 
Jul 18 10:11:37 <juneau>	kashyap: I'm aware.  =)
Jul 18 10:12:07 <juneau>	Actually thinking of going the (Neo)Mutt (+notmuch) route.
Jul 18 10:12:08 <rgb>	kashyap: granted, it chews bandwidth, which is why I put attachment filters on my mailman server to shuffle attachments off to a link on the mail/ml/web server.

Jul 20 11:40:28 *	Now talking on #remotees
Jul 20 13:40:45 <scott>	random request, but would anyone with a rhel 7 desktop/laptop machine with working bluetooth run a command for me?
Jul 20 13:41:23 <scott>	unfortunately running fedora 28 here and can't figure out how to pass my bluetooth device to my rhel 7 qemu
Jul 20 13:42:12 <jhonce>	sure
Jul 20 13:42:14 *	dgilbert is also running f28 here; but what's your bt controller - usb or pci ?
Jul 20 13:42:40 <jhonce>	I have 7.4 and 7.5
Jul 20 13:43:22 <jhonce>	7.4 is the host while 7.5 is a VM -- if that matters
Jul 20 13:43:51 <scott>	I guess another requirement is you're running gnome3
Jul 20 13:44:17 <scott>	if so, need hciconfig output from when you have BT enable and are looking at the gnome3-bluetooth dialog (where you toggle bt on and off)
Jul 20 13:44:27 <scott>	and hciconfig output after you close the bt dialog but with bt still enabled
Jul 20 13:44:34 <scott>	would be a huge help. :)
Jul 20 13:46:28 <jhonce>	https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/RTdfKs4gIOAMcdrQjBPMJA
Jul 20 13:46:33 <scott>	dgilbert, usb.
Jul 20 13:46:54 <scott>	jhonce, you're a legend. Thank you so much! jhonce++
Jul 20 13:47:16 <scott>	just needed to verify a fedora bug wasn't affecting RHEL 7.
Jul 20 13:47:18 <dgilbert>	scott: So you should be able to do usb passthrough into qemu of the controller
Jul 20 13:47:26 <jhonce>	scott: np.
Jul 20 13:47:39 <dgilbert>	scott: There are at least 3 different ways of doing usb passthrough in qemu; one of them normally works for any given device :-)
Jul 20 13:48:02 <scott>	dgilbert, unfortunately, my qemu fu is quite weak. on my todo list to fix that. 
Jul 20 13:48:14 <dgilbert>	scott: Are you using virt-manager to drive qemu?
Jul 20 13:48:30 <scott>	dgilbert, gnome-boxes
Jul 20 13:48:40 <dgilbert>	ah, hmm, I don't know how to persuade boxes to do stuff
Jul 20 13:48:56 <scott>	yeah, it's nice and simple, but doesn't seem configurable
Jul 20 13:49:00 <scott>	I might try virt-manager
Jul 20 13:51:03 <dgilbert>	scott: If you start your VM in virt-manager and then go to the 'Virtual Machine' menu there's a 'Redirect USB device' - that works with my printer OK
Jul 20 13:51:27 <dgilbert>	(* may need some perm rangling on the USB device)
Jul 20 13:51:34 <jhonce>	scott: virt-manager + virt-install is worth the climb.  I use virt-manager 90% of the time and dip into virt-install for special cases.
Jul 20 13:51:54 <scott>	thanks all. I'll make the switch.

Jul 27 09:13:56 <rgb>	dgilbert: We've got a local RH sales rep for public institutions who has been very eager to sponsor local events.
Jul 27 09:23:21 <mason>	kashyap: Ah, I was briefly excited thinking that GNU Cauldron was to be in Manchester, NH.
Jul 27 09:23:47 <kashyap>	mason: Hehe, New Hampshire, i.e.
Jul 27 09:23:56 <mason>	yes
Jul 27 09:24:08 <mason>	It's less than an hour from where I am now.
Jul 27 09:38:09 <dgilbert>	rgb: Yep, there's no one local here
Jul 27 10:16:48 <smooge>	so OSAS can usually fund projects if they are given 6 months to a year in advance. Otherwise their budgets get eaten into by the big requests which usually have some VP saying this is very important so do it
Jul 27 10:54:58 <kashyap>	dgilbert: ^ See smooge's comment above
Jul 27 10:56:00 <dgilbert>	smooge: Yeh that's not too bad, because the way this local meetup is organised is that we have a meeting every few months, so trying to line up a sponsor for a particular session is ideal but if we miss the next slot then we can hold a place
Jul 27 11:19:39 <kashyap>	Damn...the clouds are going to ruin the lunar eclipse here in the Western Eu :-(
Jul 27 11:20:12 <kashyap>	All the bloody month it was dead-hot, dry and sunny, and only _now_ does it have to rain.  Sigh
Jul 27 11:25:41 <smooge>	I was thinking we were going to have clouds and rain.. but we will have clear skies. We are also the part of the world which will not see any part of the eclipse
Jul 27 11:25:50 <kashyap>	Right
Jul 27 11:26:05 <kashyap>	No lunar eclipse this time for US, Canada, and the Greeland
Jul 27 11:26:34 <jgh>	cumulo-granite - that well-known scourge of mountain flying in gliders
Jul 27 11:26:38 <smooge>	All the local news were putting up reports about it.. and then someone asked "so can we actually see it" and they are like "uhm sorry"
Jul 27 11:41:40 <dgilbert>	kashyap: It's also being very specific; 7pm <5% chance of rain, some clouds;  8pm thunderstorms, 60% chance of heavy rain;  9pm bright sunshine - so who knows
Jul 27 11:42:12 <kashyap>	dgilbert: Yeah, hope it won't be all ruined 
Jul 27 11:45:27 <scott>	go rent a paraglider and try to get up above the clouds
Jul 27 11:45:30 <scott>	what could go wrong?
Jul 27 14:06:07 <scott>	dgilbert, you try ripgrep out yet? I switched from ag. Seems a little faster, although I don't have the benchmarks to back that up
Jul 27 14:29:52 <dgilbert>	scott: I hadn't - faster than ag you say.  Hmm
Jul 27 14:30:47 <scott>	written in rust too. neat project
Jul 27 14:35:10 <dgilbert>	nice; does it have a convenient two letter command name?
Jul 27 14:42:25 <scott>	dgilbert, rg!
Jul 27 14:44:24 <dgilbert>	oh well, that's ok :-)

Sep 05 10:46:41 <seii>	mason: I'm guessing the first line would have to be the strawman, because I think the second line would just be fact. ^_-
Sep 05 10:47:58 <hrw>	does wayland supports something like X11 forwarding?
Sep 05 10:48:35 <mason>	hrw: No.
Sep 05 10:48:45 <hrw>	so I stay with x11
Sep 05 10:49:01 <hrw>	until IPv8 gets popular
Sep 05 10:49:45 <hrw>	Red Hat vpn uses same address space as Linaro vpn so I run one on desktop, second on laptop. Need to run firefox on laptop too often to get rid of x11
Sep 05 10:50:18 <hrw>	my setup is "run whatever I need on whichever box I need but window has to be on desktop's desktop"
Sep 05 10:51:10 <dgilbert>	hrw: You obviously need some fiendishly clever bit of NATing
Sep 05 10:51:13 <mason>	hrw: You can fix that by specifying more specific routes, unless the actual same Class C's are shared.
Sep 05 10:51:33 <hrw>	10.0.0.0/8 in both cases or sth like that
Sep 05 10:51:51 <mason>	hrw: My home network overlaps with Red Hat, but I just mask the overlaps in favour of home, since I seem never to use anything we've got on the overlapping address space.
Sep 05 10:52:08 <mason>	hrw: Right. So add a specific route for non-Red Hat.
Sep 05 10:52:19 <mason>	hrw: You can do it with either legacy networking or with networkmanager.

Sep 05 10:53:53 <mason>	Ah, I'm too hidebound to change my home network for a work VPN.
Sep 05 10:53:55 <hrw>	prefer not to guess do RH have some machines in 10.101.0.0/16 range
Sep 05 10:54:20 <hrw>	mason: I took that range when setup network at home
Sep 05 10:54:27 <mason>	hrw: If it's something you need you can always do Even More Specific routes to it.
Sep 05 10:54:31 <hrw>	also have 192.168.100.0/24 for vpn
Sep 05 10:54:45 <hrw>	mason: works fine with current setup
Sep 05 10:54:56 <hrw>	at least my company laptop has something to do ;d
Sep 05 10:54:56 <mason>	It would, but you've had to bend what you're doing. :P
Sep 05 10:55:13 <dgilbert>	hrw: I wonder if these days you can do it with network namespaces and have different processes with different routes
Sep 05 10:55:44 <hrw>	I am too lazy to spend time on reading how complex networking is in current times
Sep 05 10:56:02 <hrw>	I know that I can run a container with vpn in it and route through that container for example
Sep 05 10:56:38 <dgilbert>	nod
Sep 05 10:58:19 <hrw>	I would love support for using multiple vpn connections automatically in NM too
Sep 05 10:58:46 <mason>	hrw: Can't you do that now? Admittedly I haven't tried.
Sep 05 10:58:47 <hrw>	'I am out of home, connecting through my cellphone so connect to home-vpn and to linaro-vpn please'
Sep 05 10:58:54 <hrw>	mason: UI allows one vpn
Sep 05 10:58:54 <mason>	Just a matter of setting the right routes, no?
Sep 05 10:58:57 <mason>	ah
Sep 05 10:59:04 <mason>	what about with nmcli?
Sep 05 10:59:23 <hrw>	mason: quicker to do few clicks to connect manually
Sep 05 10:59:32 <dgilbert>	nmcli is pretty easy
Sep 05 10:59:50 <hrw>	prefer nmtui-connect ;d
Sep 05 11:00:01 <hrw>	(reverse-i-search)`nm': ssh gossamer.lan -vt sudo nmtui-connect
Sep 05 11:00:13 <dgilbert>	ah yes, nmtui is nice, I've only used it for editing

Sep 05 12:07:35 <mhayden>	how does one change the audio sink for an application that is not currently playing audio, but will play audio occasionally (like thunderbird's audio alerts)
Sep 05 12:07:45 <mhayden>	if it's actively playing, move-sink works fine
Sep 05 12:08:00 <mhayden>	but it's hard to change it if it only makes a sound occasionally
Sep 05 12:08:32 <simo>	mhayden: I would guess there is some config file that records where an app outputs ?
Sep 05 12:08:59 <mhayden>	that's what i was thinking
Sep 05 12:09:03 <mhayden>	still hunting
Sep 05 12:10:04 <simo>	mhayden: a tdb file in .pulse ?
Sep 05 12:13:28 <mhayden>	ah, there are some interesting files in there
Sep 06 14:47:01 <justine>	anyone had luck getting their polycom phone to work NOT plugged directly into their router?
Sep 06 14:47:42 <justine>	i bought a powerline adapter which works, but the socket it's connected to now makes noise :(
Sep 06 14:47:42 <dgilbert>	justine: Well that depends what you mean; mine goes into a Linux box I use as my NAT firewall
Sep 06 14:48:55 <justine>	dgilbert, i only have a verizon router, but it's on a different floor. trying to avoid having them run another line
Sep 06 14:51:49 <simo>	justine: not sure what you mean
Sep 06 14:52:03 <simo>	my phone is in its own vlan behind a switch connected to my router
Sep 06 14:54:00 <justine>	sorry, probably doesn't help that i'm not very technical
Sep 06 14:54:27 <justine>	i'm not able to connect directly to my router so trying to figure out a workaround
Sep 06 14:54:35 <dgilbert>	justine: Try using a laptop through the powerline adaptor first and seeing what happens there, before trying weird things like the phone
Sep 06 14:55:05 <justine>	dgilbert++ thanks
Sep 06 14:55:52 <dgilbert>	justine: The phone does do a few weird things, but start off with checking the easy things first like that
Sep 06 14:57:38 <smooge>	what kind of noise and where is it coming from
Sep 06 14:58:45 <simo>	justine: so you connected the powerline to your router on one side and the phone on the other ?
Sep 06 14:59:19 <smooge>	justine, (I forgot to tag you first time) what kind of noise and where is it coming from
Sep 06 15:00:33 <justine>	smooge, it's an infrequent clicking noise coming from the wall socket
Sep 06 15:00:42 <justine>	so that's a little troubling lol
Sep 06 15:01:25 <dgilbert>	that's.......scary
Sep 06 15:02:30 <smooge>	ok I am going to guess it is the powerline converter dealing with power spikes but it could also be a problem with the plug sockets themselves.
Sep 06 15:03:03 <justine>	yep. i only just installed. think i'll have to get them to run a line after all
Sep 06 15:03:50 <dgilbert>	justine: Is this your own building?
Sep 06 15:05:03 <justine>	dgilbert, yes my house
Sep 06 15:05:09 <smooge>	most of the reports I see on noise associated with powerline converters is that the noise coming from the computer or nearby radio speakers. This looks to be that the powerline converters are RF transmitting
Sep 06 15:05:59 <dgilbert>	justine: Personally I'd run an ethernet cable (cat5/6) between the floors; that's something you can get done without your ISP
Sep 06 15:06:16 <dgilbert>	smooge: Yes, they're effectively radio over mains cable that was never designed for it
Sep 06 15:07:05 <justine>	dgilbert, thanks i think that's what i'll end up doing
Sep 06 15:07:35 <dgilbert>	(I think ours goes a somewhat odd route, perhaps through/under the downstairs bathroom, but hey it gets to the router :-)
Sep 06 15:12:24 <justine>	dgilbert, ha i think mine will run a similar course!
Sep 06 15:12:30 <justine>	thanks everyone!
Sep 06 15:19:15 <scott>	you can try MOCA as well if you have a cable outlet nearby
Sep 06 15:19:22 <dgilbert>	MOCA?
Sep 06 15:19:24 <scott>	much better than powerline, but not as good as ethernet
Sep 06 15:20:19 <dgilbert>	what's MOCA?
Sep 06 15:20:19 <scott>	dgilbert, uses coax lines to create a network. those are in most houses/rooms in USA.
Sep 06 15:20:32 <dgilbert>	oh, never heard of that
Sep 06 15:20:54 <scott>	dgilbert, https://www.amazon.com/Actiontec-Bonded-Ethernet-Adapter-ECB6200S02/dp/B013J7OBUU
Sep 06 15:21:27 <scott>	I had powerline for a bit. Worked well, but I lived next to a guy with a lots of fluorescent lights. Powerline internet could go out whenever he turned his lights on/off
Sep 06 15:21:37 <scott>	moca was stable though
Sep 06 15:22:11 <dgilbert>	scott: Interesting, never seen that here; but widespread coax wiring is rarer
Sep 06 15:23:28 <scott>	dgilbert, UK? What's the most common internet connection there, DSL I'm gussing?
Sep 06 15:23:58 <scott>	USA has telecom as well as cable TV monopolies in most towns, hence "cable"/coax internet is incredibly common here (unfortunately...)
Sep 06 15:24:14 <justine>	scott, interesting. just bought this as a last ditch effort: https://www.amazon.com/IOGEAR-Universal-Ethernet-Adapter-GWU627/dp/B004UAKCS6/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1536261824&sr=1-4&keywords=wireless+ethernet+adapter
Sep 06 15:24:57 <scott>	justine, that might work if you get good wireless signal strength where you're at
Sep 06 15:25:01 <dgilbert>	scott: Yeh, although cable is reasonably popular (that's what I'm on) but it's not normally wired to lots of rooms with actual cable boxes; it's normally more cable to one or two rooms and then just networking
Sep 06 15:25:19 <scott>	dgilbert, ah, I gotcha. Yeah, we love our TVs in America. :)
Sep 06 15:26:37 <dgilbert>	scott: Cable wasn't that popular for actual TV delivery until relatively recently, people just used free-over-the-air TV
Sep 06 15:26:57 <scott>	makes sense. lot easier to do that on a small island. :)
Sep 06 15:27:31 <justine>	you also have that great bbc programming :)
Sep 06 15:28:17 <simo>	scott: free over the air is easier everywhere :)
Sep 06 15:28:30 <scott>	fair point
Sep 06 15:29:05 <simo>	except when the goal is to cram 1000 channels in it, then spectrum limitations kick in
Sep 06 15:29:16 <simo>	(in the past at least)
Sep 06 15:30:04 <simo>	also I think you were humorous but Britain is not a small island :)
Sep 06 15:30:23 <scott>	takes what, 13 minutes to drive across the UK? :)
Sep 06 15:30:47 <simo>	yeah I guess a concorde did take that time :)
Sep 06 15:32:25 <dgilbert>	talking of which, time to turn the brain off and watch some TV
Sep 06 15:37:01 *	rgb has had mixed results with powerline adaptors...  the thing kept dropping the conneciton every few minutes for almost a minute in our house in New Delhi.  And here (Ottawa), our solar panel microinverters using PLC (PowerLine Communications, 144kHz) sometimes vanish for a few hours.
Sep 07 14:34:38 <elynn[m]>	Anyone know if we have a similar dictionary for non-acronyms as https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-941888, basically, a dictionary for terms such as Eloqua, like a reverse lookup
Sep 07 14:41:06 <elynn[m]>	In my opinion, if we have a "RH Dictionary" it should just be for acronyms etc.
Sep 07 14:41:10 <elynn[m]>	shouldn't
Sep 07 14:41:28 <elynn[m]>	In my opinion, if we have a "RH Dictionary" it should not just be for acronyms etc.
Sep 07 14:51:11 <dgilbert>	elynn[m]: Personally I'd just go and add it to that dictionary
Sep 10 06:23:16 <pcfe>	good morning fellow remotees
Sep 10 06:28:08 <hrw>	elo pcfe 
Sep 10 06:29:14 <hrw>	how often you do session with rewardzone to 'get rid' of points?
Sep 10 06:29:24 <hrw>	I mean 'to give' those points to people :D
Sep 10 06:30:05 <Zhenech>	when someone did something awesome, and at the end of the FY to shell out ther remaining ones
Sep 10 06:31:52 <hrw>	thx
Sep 10 06:37:09 <thuth>	also the "we are redhat week" is a good point in time to think of colleagues who deserve a "Thank You"
Sep 10 06:37:49 <thuth>	(especially for remotees, since there is not that much things to do for remotees in that week)
Sep 10 06:42:14 <pcfe>	hrw: depends, wehen I remember and a colleague did sth that was clearly outside her/his job description I hand one out (mainly so that their boss sees they got rewarded)
Sep 10 06:42:42 <pcfe>	and then the inevitable "frack, frack, frack these points expire next week, I'd better sit down this w-e and dish out all I have to give"
Sep 10 06:43:12 <hrw>	;D
Sep 10 06:43:23 <pcfe>	thuth: good point, I'd never thought of that. But yeah, definitely that week is a good one to hand em out
Sep 10 09:58:51 <mhayden>	happy monday folks
Sep 10 10:30:48 <bcotton>	i've had enough coffee that i will allow that :-)
Sep 10 11:13:10 <mhayden>	haha

Oct 16 12:17:50 <scott>	Anyone that understands the non-californian, american vacation policy that can explain what should hopefully be a simple question to me? It looks like I get a vacation allotment of 5 days every quarter or so, and, apparently vacation expires in February of each year. So, if I get an allotment of 5 days in November, does that mean I have to use those by February 2019, or do I get a full year, i.e. they'd expire February 2020?
Oct 16 12:18:01 <scott>	Probably will ask benefits but was hoping someone would know quickly .:)
Oct 16 12:18:43 <mmccune>	scott: pto accrued in 2018 , no matter when it accrues, expires in feb 2019
Oct 16 12:19:03 <scott>	mmccune, that's exactly what I needed. Cheers!
Oct 16 12:19:20 <mmccune>	sure thing
Oct 16 12:50:27 <smooge>	next year we will all acrue all pto days on Feb 28 2019
Oct 16 12:58:58 <scott>	hope I don't get excited, take off all of march, then regret it for the rest of the year
Oct 16 13:01:12 <dgilbert>	do you guys have to wait for your pto to acrue before you can take it?
Oct 16 13:04:06 <nickthetait>	scott: for maximum effect be sure to quit on your last day of vacation so you have to pay it all back :P

Oct 18 10:52:08 <juneau>	"specialty-based routng" as I recall?
Oct 18 10:52:44 <bcotton>	lufimtse: i asked the acronym bot in #wordnerds and it said:
Oct 18 10:52:48 <bcotton>	[10:52] <AcroBot> bcotton: SBR: Skill-Based Routing
Oct 18 10:52:49 <bcotton>	[10:52] <AcroBot> bcotton: SBR: Specialty-based Routing @gss, @RH

Nov 21 11:29:32 <rgb>	thinkpad T460p fan JETENGINE update...  upgraded from f27 to f29 didn't solve it.  upgraded from 2.3 bios to 2.27 bios didn't solve it.  next will try f26 USB live image...
Nov 21 11:37:04 <dgilbert>	rgb: Tried the thinkfan package?
Nov 21 11:40:29 *	rgb tries
Nov 21 11:43:56 <rgb>	never heard of it...  does it start up on boot by default if installed?
Nov 21 11:44:16 <dgilbert>	cant remember and I can't remember if it actually helps on modern machines
Nov 21 13:19:16 <rgb>	well, that didn't make a difference...  it bailed on config file.  digging deeper, it is set to auto in /sys and root isn't allowed to writ to it...
Nov 21 13:20:11 <rgb>	does f27-29 hate me because I'm using something other than gnome (lxde)?
Nov 21 13:58:20 <rgb>	looks like thinkpad_acpi module needs fan_control=1, so a reboot is necessary and it should work...
