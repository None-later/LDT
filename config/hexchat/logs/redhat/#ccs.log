Oct 18 11:09:11 <dopey>	lufimtse: Command not understood or term not found
Oct 18 11:09:51 <lesw>	lufimtse, You may see that message if a term hasn't been added to the database.
Oct 18 11:10:16 <lesw>	lufimtse, I think jawatts was correct with "sprecialty based routing."

Oct 18 14:49:59 <c-huff>	stesmith: I don't want to let silence be your only answer, but I don't know enough to provide any helpful comment :(

Oct 22 09:37:04 <stesmith_>	I'm trying to install asciidoctor-pdf. Need to upgrade to Ruby 2.1? I'm having probs doing that
Oct 22 09:49:35 <alexd>	stesmith_: what command are you running / what errors are you seeing?

Oct 22 11:32:28 <dnaro>	docs-help: howdy. gitignore being ignored on some repos. I've googled without much success. have to rm build/* before commit. anyone have tips on how to fix?
Oct 22 11:32:53 <sgilda>	dnaro, i'm not sure what you are asking
Oct 22 11:33:06 <vslavik>	dnaro did you add build by hand before changing .gitignore?
Oct 22 11:33:20 <sgilda>	a .gitignore file is used to specify file types hat you do not want added to the git repo
Oct 22 11:33:22 <vslavik>	second, does it have the dot?
Oct 22 11:33:25 <dnaro>	sgilda: sorry. long day here. and still recovering from a team trip last week.
Oct 22 11:33:27 <vslavik>	third, did you commit it?
Oct 22 11:33:42 <vslavik>	uncommitted it changes only the local copy...
Oct 22 11:34:09 <sgilda>	i will let vslavik handle this one :-)
Oct 22 11:34:18 <dnaro>	~/.gitignore contains all the files I want excluded from each commit
Oct 22 11:34:19 <vslavik>	hah, I know nothing!
Oct 22 11:34:22 <dnaro>	it's in my home dir
Oct 22 11:34:31 <dnaro>	it includes build/*
Oct 22 11:34:40 <vslavik>	oh that one - I always use the one in repo
Oct 22 11:34:47 <sgilda>	it should be in the root of the repo directory
Oct 22 11:34:57 <vslavik>	how about excluding just "build" w/o slashes etc
Oct 22 11:35:15 <vslavik>	actually gitignore is a bit like htaccess, it is applied recursively
Oct 22 11:35:27 <vslavik>	...I think
Oct 22 11:35:39 <vslavik>	I have routinely gitignores in subdirs in repo and it works
Oct 22 11:36:06 <sgilda>	this is the eap doc file: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-documentation/eap-documentation/blob/master/.gitignore
Oct 22 11:36:22 <dnaro>	hmm. well, I thought .gitignore is the preferred option because it's global
Oct 22 11:36:24 <sgilda>	if you want to compare
Oct 22 11:36:41 <vslavik>	dnaro you can have .gitignore in your home, but also in your git repo
Oct 22 11:36:47 <vslavik>	and multiples of it
Oct 22 11:36:55 <dnaro>	vslavik yeah
Oct 22 11:37:04 <dnaro>	but the one in home is global
Oct 22 11:37:04 <vslavik>	every dir is an opportunity for one more .gitignore :)
Oct 22 11:37:18 <vslavik>	dnaro did it work for you before?
Oct 22 11:38:07 <c-huff>	dnaro: I'd favor including it in the repo's root instead of your home directory. That way if anyone else clones the repo it's excluded for them as well
Oct 22 11:38:36 <dnaro>	let me have a look here
Oct 22 11:39:26 <sgilda>	I'm with c-huff 
Oct 22 11:40:57 <vslavik>	I have to run, but... try options :)
Oct 22 11:41:15 <vslavik>	what works for me is have .gitignore next to master.adoc and in it a line that reads just "build"
Oct 22 11:42:32 <dnaro>	yeah. that doesn't seem to work. oddly enough. I've added .gitignore to the repo but it still picks up build/*
Oct 22 11:42:35 <sgilda>	dnaro, is your .gitignore file checked in? can i look at it online?
Oct 22 11:43:04 <dnaro>	sgilda: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/red-hat-jboss-data-grid-documentation/rhdg-documentation/merge_requests/14
Oct 22 11:43:21 <sgilda>	thanks dnaro . let me poke around a bit
Oct 22 11:46:51 <sgilda>	dnaro, where is your build script?
Oct 22 11:47:11 <sgilda>	never mind!
Oct 22 11:47:17 <sgilda>	maven ;-)
Oct 22 11:49:06 <sgilda>	that doesn't seem to work :(
Oct 22 11:49:15 <sgilda>	dnaro, how do you build the docs here?
Oct 22 11:49:54 <dnaro>	cd into the dir that contains the master.adoc file
Oct 22 11:50:14 <dnaro>	then run my trusty alias 'adoc_build'. one sec...
Oct 22 11:50:30 <dnaro>	alias adoc_build='ccutil compile --lang en_US --type asciidoc'
Oct 22 11:56:50 <sgilda>	dnaro, you need some scripts ;-)
Oct 22 11:57:07 <dnaro>	sgilda: I think I need a lot of things
Oct 22 11:57:08 <sgilda>	dnaro, i just checked it out and the .gitignore works
Oct 22 11:57:37 <dnaro>	flip
Oct 22 11:58:18 <sgilda>	hang on 
Oct 22 11:59:19 <sgilda>	hmmm.
Oct 22 11:59:35 <sgilda>	it does show that you can add the build/ directory though
Oct 22 12:10:05 <sgilda>	dnaro, you are right. it seems not to work. i'll play with it a bit later. i have things i need to get done first
Oct 22 12:10:52 <dnaro>	sgilda: cheers. I'm still trying to play with it a bit here too. also distracted by actual work. as always, thank you for the help!
