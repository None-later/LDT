Dec 09 10:21:17 <scela>	hi
Dec 09 10:21:24 <lufimtse>	hullo
Dec 09 10:21:39 <scela>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/86259/
Dec 09 10:21:54 <lufimtse>	yea
Dec 09 10:21:57 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Dec 09 10:22:21 <scela>	so this methods you're adding are only supposed to be used 'internally' and externals should use the color registry?
Dec 09 10:22:42 <lufimtse>	welll
Dec 09 10:22:49 <lufimtse>	I'd like it to be used in many places
Dec 09 10:22:58 <lufimtse>	but Sergey suggests to keep it internal
Dec 09 10:23:00 <lufimtse>	so there is that.
Dec 09 10:23:23 <lufimtse>	I have to update the comment, the ID of the property will change in future.
Dec 09 10:23:28 <lufimtse>	Thoughts?
Dec 09 10:23:38 <lufimtse>	that color is very useful, works on light and dark theme
Dec 09 10:23:47 <lufimtse>	can be used to fix lots of color issues.
Dec 09 10:23:52 <lufimtse>	And not everything has to be stylable. 
Dec 09 10:26:16 <lufimtse>	Maybe I should make a pitch suggesting it to be public rather than internal
Dec 09 10:27:19 <scela>	it's not ideal to have operating system conditionals in jface level
Dec 09 10:27:45 <lufimtse>	Well, my initial submission was for SWT: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/86106/
Dec 09 10:27:53 <lufimtse>	And people declined it.
Dec 09 10:28:04 <lufimtse>	I'd like to have it in SWT also.
Dec 09 10:28:52 <lufimtse>	But at present, the argument is that SWT doesn't define Hovers, thus color logic for hovers should not be in SWT.
Dec 09 10:28:53 <lufimtse>	meh
Dec 09 10:30:59 <lufimtse>	Thoughts?
Dec 09 10:34:02 <scela>	what is the root problem you're trying to solve here?
Dec 09 10:40:35 <scela>	org.eclipse.ui.workbench.HOVER_(FOREGROUND|BACKGROUND) is themeable and defined on p.ui level
Dec 09 10:40:45 <scela>	the COLOR_* stuff in SWT level and unthemeable
Dec 09 10:42:06 <scela>	now why would people on p.ui level and above ever need to use the COLOR_* (or your corresponding methods)
Dec 09 10:42:14 <scela>	i'm aware that this already happens in p.ui
Dec 09 10:43:12 <scela>	but i suppose the solution here would be to gradually convert this misuse of SWT api and go through the p.ui-defined properties
Dec 09 10:51:58 <lufimtse>	Hover has complexities. Like you need to implement change listeners. And not everything needs to be stylable.
Dec 09 10:52:08 <lufimtse>	ex heap status or things trivial things like that.
Dec 09 10:52:48 <lufimtse>	Also, COLOR_LIST works well with themes, ex on white theme it's white, on Gtk3 dark theme it's dark.
Dec 09 10:53:15 <lufimtse>	It's something that works well and it makes color issues much easier to fix.
Dec 09 10:53:53 <lufimtse>	in general, people shouldn't be using SWT.TOOL_TIP
Dec 09 10:54:04 <lufimtse>	this is a better replacement for it.
Dec 09 10:54:18 <lufimtse>	And then if people want things stylable, they can use HOVER
Dec 09 10:55:52 <lufimtse>	Also note, that api does not conflict with HOVER, you can have the new API as default color, but still style it with HOVER in the higher level components.
Dec 09 10:56:27 <lufimtse>	An example of that: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=508776#c11
Dec 09 11:00:39 <scela>	it looks like you're having your share of fun with markus :)
Dec 09 11:08:04 <scela>	why not add these colors to the color registry
Dec 09 11:08:14 <scela>	and have a key in JFacePrefernces to pick them up
Dec 09 11:08:40 <scela>	and then control how these colors are put in the registry somewhere else
Dec 09 11:10:50 <lufimtse>	Can you email me more about this? gotta run.

Apr 18 11:22:45 <scela>	hey
Apr 18 11:44:56 <lufimtse>	sup
Apr 18 11:45:29 <scela>	report time
Apr 18 11:45:49 <lufimtse>	I think I emailed it already?
Apr 18 11:46:05 <lufimtse>	an hour ago
Apr 18 11:46:29 <scela>	it was not received in the list
Apr 18 11:46:41 <scela>	but email is crap today
Apr 18 11:46:47 <scela>	so it might be on its way
Apr 18 11:46:59 <lufimtse>	strange
Apr 18 11:47:08 <lufimtse>	It shows as sent in my gmail
Apr 18 11:47:16 <lufimtse>	should I send again?
Apr 18 11:47:23 <scela>	you could try
Apr 18 11:47:49 <lufimtse>	I sent it again.
Apr 18 11:49:31 <scela>	nothing
Apr 18 11:49:55 <scela>	oh well, i guess it's because of the email outage (see announce-list)
Apr 18 11:50:13 <scela>	anyway let's wait for a while and i'll ping you if I need you to do anything else
Apr 18 11:50:20 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 18 11:50:32 <lufimtse>	I cat fpaste it if you need sooner
Apr 18 11:53:07 <scela>	it's there
Apr 18 11:53:14 <scela>	the 'again' one though
Apr 18 11:53:22 <scela>	old one probably got lost 
Apr 18 12:10:07 <lufimtse>	hmm
Apr 18 12:10:08 <lufimtse>	odd
Apr 18 12:10:22 <scela>	they all came again in a bunch now
Apr 18 12:10:28 <lufimtse>	I see
Apr 18 12:10:50 <scela>	there is a major screw up with email today so that explains everything

Nov 06 11:43:14 <lufimtse_>	btw, let me know if you have any jira questions, I think I have a good feel for it now.
Nov 06 11:43:42 <lufimtse_>	to get Bugzilla tasks to show up, the whiteboard needs to have "RHT" tag in it
Nov 06 11:43:57 <lufimtse_>	once an hour a crawler picks up new bugzilla tasks
Nov 06 11:44:17 <lufimtse_>	Epics span across multiple sprints, they're usually not part of a specific sprint
Nov 06 11:44:30 <lufimtse_>	also sub-tasks can't be added to sprints, only regular tasks
Nov 06 11:50:24 <scela>	ok thanks for the hints
Nov 06 11:51:58 <scela>	I'll take a look in details so don't worry too much about this
Nov 06 11:52:07 <scela>	we need you focused on that webkit stuff ;)

Nov 28 11:11:47 <scela>	hey
Nov 28 11:11:52 <lufimtse>	good day
Nov 28 11:12:55 <scela>	I sent out a meeting request for our 1 to 1 for tomorrow
Nov 28 11:12:59 <scela>	how does it look to you?
Nov 28 11:13:12 <scela>	is that too early for you?
Nov 28 11:13:18 <lufimtse>	leeemmemee check
Nov 28 11:14:00 <lufimtse>	is 1 hour later possible or better at time that you have there? 
Nov 28 11:14:24 <lufimtse>	I'm flexible
Nov 28 11:14:30 <lufimtse>	like if no difference to you
Nov 28 11:14:40 <lufimtse>	but if current time is better, than that works.
Nov 28 11:14:49 <scela>	current time is better for me
Nov 28 11:14:51 <lufimtse>	ok
Nov 28 11:14:53 <lufimtse>	y
Nov 28 11:14:59 <scela>	but if too early for you, I can push it
Nov 28 11:15:25 <lufimtse>	nah, it's ok. I'll go to gym at lunch instead of going in the morning every 3 weeks :-)
Nov 28 11:15:54 <scela>	ok
Nov 28 11:16:03 <scela>	and second thing: https://issues.jboss.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=4243&quickFilter=14551
Nov 28 11:16:32 <scela>	put your previously-etherpad items in there when you get a chance
Nov 28 11:16:42 <scela>	details are on the email I sent yesterday 
Nov 28 11:17:20 <scela>	basically just summary and sprint (rest should normally be there by default)
Nov 28 11:17:33 <scela>	feel free to provide some details but mostly bug numbers and such
Nov 28 11:17:35 <lufimtse>	Mine are in DEVTOOLS
Nov 28 11:17:37 <lufimtse>	board
Nov 28 11:17:47 <scela>	why are they there?
Nov 28 11:17:53 <lufimtse>	I think the script was not working or something?
Nov 28 11:17:56 <scela>	did you create them through my link?
Nov 28 11:18:33 <scela>	you can create a some high-level items there and then link the specific bugs to those
Nov 28 11:19:09 <scela>	bbiab
Nov 28 11:19:17 <lufimtse>	Ah, I created in Developer tools instead of "Eclipse Release Train"
Nov 28 11:19:37 <lufimtse>	I thought the Developer Tools project was created for our use
Nov 28 11:27:07 <lufimtse>	Ah, I see. ERT for Eclipse/uprtreem stuff. DEV for developer tools stuff, RHBZ for red hat bugzilla stuff.
Nov 28 11:27:19 <lufimtse>	I'll move things along.
Nov 28 11:37:01 <lufimtse>	ok, I moved tasks from DEVTOOLS to ERT
Nov 28 11:40:55 <lufimtse>	thanks for pointing out.
