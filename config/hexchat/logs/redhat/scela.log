Dec 09 10:21:17 <scela>	hi
Dec 09 10:21:24 <lufimtse>	hullo
Dec 09 10:21:39 <scela>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/86259/
Dec 09 10:21:54 <lufimtse>	yea
Dec 09 10:21:57 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Dec 09 10:22:21 <scela>	so this methods you're adding are only supposed to be used 'internally' and externals should use the color registry?
Dec 09 10:22:42 <lufimtse>	welll
Dec 09 10:22:49 <lufimtse>	I'd like it to be used in many places
Dec 09 10:22:58 <lufimtse>	but Sergey suggests to keep it internal
Dec 09 10:23:00 <lufimtse>	so there is that.
Dec 09 10:23:23 <lufimtse>	I have to update the comment, the ID of the property will change in future.
Dec 09 10:23:28 <lufimtse>	Thoughts?
Dec 09 10:23:38 <lufimtse>	that color is very useful, works on light and dark theme
Dec 09 10:23:47 <lufimtse>	can be used to fix lots of color issues.
Dec 09 10:23:52 <lufimtse>	And not everything has to be stylable. 
Dec 09 10:26:16 <lufimtse>	Maybe I should make a pitch suggesting it to be public rather than internal
Dec 09 10:27:19 <scela>	it's not ideal to have operating system conditionals in jface level
Dec 09 10:27:45 <lufimtse>	Well, my initial submission was for SWT: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/86106/
Dec 09 10:27:53 <lufimtse>	And people declined it.
Dec 09 10:28:04 <lufimtse>	I'd like to have it in SWT also.
Dec 09 10:28:52 <lufimtse>	But at present, the argument is that SWT doesn't define Hovers, thus color logic for hovers should not be in SWT.
Dec 09 10:28:53 <lufimtse>	meh
Dec 09 10:30:59 <lufimtse>	Thoughts?
Dec 09 10:34:02 <scela>	what is the root problem you're trying to solve here?
Dec 09 10:40:35 <scela>	org.eclipse.ui.workbench.HOVER_(FOREGROUND|BACKGROUND) is themeable and defined on p.ui level
Dec 09 10:40:45 <scela>	the COLOR_* stuff in SWT level and unthemeable
Dec 09 10:42:06 <scela>	now why would people on p.ui level and above ever need to use the COLOR_* (or your corresponding methods)
Dec 09 10:42:14 <scela>	i'm aware that this already happens in p.ui
Dec 09 10:43:12 <scela>	but i suppose the solution here would be to gradually convert this misuse of SWT api and go through the p.ui-defined properties
Dec 09 10:51:58 <lufimtse>	Hover has complexities. Like you need to implement change listeners. And not everything needs to be stylable.
Dec 09 10:52:08 <lufimtse>	ex heap status or things trivial things like that.
Dec 09 10:52:48 <lufimtse>	Also, COLOR_LIST works well with themes, ex on white theme it's white, on Gtk3 dark theme it's dark.
Dec 09 10:53:15 <lufimtse>	It's something that works well and it makes color issues much easier to fix.
Dec 09 10:53:53 <lufimtse>	in general, people shouldn't be using SWT.TOOL_TIP
Dec 09 10:54:04 <lufimtse>	this is a better replacement for it.
Dec 09 10:54:18 <lufimtse>	And then if people want things stylable, they can use HOVER
Dec 09 10:55:52 <lufimtse>	Also note, that api does not conflict with HOVER, you can have the new API as default color, but still style it with HOVER in the higher level components.
Dec 09 10:56:27 <lufimtse>	An example of that: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=508776#c11
Dec 09 11:00:39 <scela>	it looks like you're having your share of fun with markus :)
Dec 09 11:08:04 <scela>	why not add these colors to the color registry
Dec 09 11:08:14 <scela>	and have a key in JFacePrefernces to pick them up
Dec 09 11:08:40 <scela>	and then control how these colors are put in the registry somewhere else
Dec 09 11:10:50 <lufimtse>	Can you email me more about this? gotta run.

Apr 18 11:45:29 <scela>	report time
Apr 18 11:45:49 <lufimtse>	I think I emailed it already?
Apr 18 11:46:05 <lufimtse>	an hour ago
Apr 18 11:46:29 <scela>	it was not received in the list
Apr 18 11:46:41 <scela>	but email is crap today
Apr 18 11:46:47 <scela>	so it might be on its way
Apr 18 11:46:59 <lufimtse>	strange
Apr 18 11:47:08 <lufimtse>	It shows as sent in my gmail
Apr 18 11:47:16 <lufimtse>	should I send again?
Apr 18 11:47:23 <scela>	you could try
Apr 18 11:47:49 <lufimtse>	I sent it again.
Apr 18 11:49:31 <scela>	nothing
Apr 18 11:49:55 <scela>	oh well, i guess it's because of the email outage (see announce-list)
Apr 18 11:50:13 <scela>	anyway let's wait for a while and i'll ping you if I need you to do anything else
Apr 18 11:50:20 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 18 11:50:32 <lufimtse>	I cat fpaste it if you need sooner
Apr 18 11:53:07 <scela>	it's there
Apr 18 11:53:14 <scela>	the 'again' one though
Apr 18 11:53:22 <scela>	old one probably got lost 
Apr 18 12:10:07 <lufimtse>	hmm
Apr 18 12:10:08 <lufimtse>	odd
Apr 18 12:10:22 <scela>	they all came again in a bunch now
Apr 18 12:10:28 <lufimtse>	I see
Apr 18 12:10:50 <scela>	there is a major screw up with email today so that explains everything
