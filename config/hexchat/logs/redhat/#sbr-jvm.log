Oct 18 12:13:22 <lufimtse>	Hello guys. I'm a consultant on site. They are asking if we support multiple concurrent *minor* versions of OpenJDK running on the same RHEL server. Our KB article mentiones that technically we support such config: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3508401   But do we provide 'customer support' for when a customer runs an older jdk build on a newer RHEL?

Oct 18 12:15:53 <lufimtse>	Also, would we support such a setup on RHEL 6? (the article only mentions RHEL 7)
