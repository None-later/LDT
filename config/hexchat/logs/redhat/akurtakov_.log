Sep 12 13:29:30 <akurtakov_>	btw, are you fine with 11:30 call tomorrow
Sep 12 14:13:51 <lufimtse>	ok
Sep 13 10:52:51 <lufimtse>	Hullo, do you know why Daniel is oppose to using COLOR_LIST_?
[akurtakov_ has address ~akurtakov@vpn1-5-210.ams2.redhat.com]
Sep 13 10:53:12 <akurtakov_>	because the yellowish match better
Sep 13 10:53:17 <akurtakov_>	for his preference
Sep 13 10:53:32 <akurtakov_>	and this is the color_info on win (old release at least)
Sep 13 10:53:37 <akurtakov_>	not sure about win 10
Sep 13 10:53:51 <lufimtse>	hmm
Sep 13 10:54:34 <akurtakov_>	will we use my bluejeans
Sep 13 10:54:44 <akurtakov_>	let me send you the link 
Sep 13 10:54:51 <akurtakov_>	when I'm done with the pmc meeting
Sep 13 10:54:58 <akurtakov_>	it never goes longer than half an hour
Sep 13 10:54:59 <lufimtse>	ok
Sep 13 11:02:41 <lufimtse>	Hmm. Maybe we should change the color of COLOR_INFO and use something like 'popover' colors instead.
Sep 13 11:02:41 <lufimtse>	http://storage1.static.itmages.com/i/16/0913/h_1473778981_8302260_ae578ea345.png
Sep 13 11:02:45 <lufimtse>	I'll experiment.
Sep 13 11:02:49 <lufimtse>	on swt level...
Sep 13 11:03:07 <lufimtse>	that could fix a whole bunch of inverted color issues and Dani would be hapyp.
Sep 13 11:03:16 <akurtakov_>	no
Sep 13 11:03:29 <akurtakov_>	we can't change color_info on swt level
Sep 13 11:03:35 <akurtakov_>	as this would break real tooltips
