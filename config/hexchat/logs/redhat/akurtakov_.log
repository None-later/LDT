Aug 29 12:16:44 <akurtakov_>	I screwed the message
Aug 29 12:16:53 <akurtakov_>	we need swt part of the patch to be backported

Aug 29 12:19:07 <lufimtse>	the only SWT commit is this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77098/
Aug 29 12:19:33 <lufimtse>	So basically backport to maintenance
Aug 29 12:19:52 <lufimtse>	I think Ian is in the process of backporting it to maint at the moment
Aug 29 12:20:09 <lufimtse>	he went out for lunch, will followup with him after.
Aug 29 12:20:10 <akurtakov_>	ah nice

Aug 29 15:02:18 <lufimtse>	Just to clarify, should we also look into this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79948/ or leave it to platform guys?

[akurtakov_ has address ~akurtakov@vpn1-5-210.ams2.redhat.com]
Sep 13 10:53:12 <akurtakov_>	because the yellowish match better
Sep 13 10:53:17 <akurtakov_>	for his preference
Sep 13 10:53:32 <akurtakov_>	and this is the color_info on win (old release at least)

Sep 13 11:02:49 <lufimtse>	on swt level...
Sep 13 11:03:07 <lufimtse>	that could fix a whole bunch of inverted color issues and Dani would be hapyp.

Nov 22 10:55:01 <lufimtse>	hello
Nov 22 10:55:20 <akurtakov_>	so how is the array thing going ?
Nov 22 10:55:55 <lufimtse>	It's doable, just takes a bit of time. For now I'm working on the presentation for eclipse camp
Nov 22 10:56:14 <lufimtse>	I was thinking of first working on Browser Function
Nov 22 10:56:23 <akurtakov_>	ah ok
Nov 22 10:56:24 <lufimtse>	since evaluate() array is doable, just takes time.
Nov 22 10:56:29 <akurtakov_>	so what's the status there?
Nov 22 10:56:35 <lufimtse>	browser function?
Nov 22 10:56:40 <akurtakov_>	yup
Nov 22 10:56:58 <lufimtse>	I was given a pointer to new UI api, now gotta tinker around with it

Dec 14 10:04:07 <akurtakov_>	morning
Dec 14 10:04:41 <lufimtse>	Thanks for pinging me on Webkit2 progress. I need that sometimes :-). Otherwise sometimes I get carried away with stuff.
Dec 14 10:14:57 <akurtakov_>	so we are missing WebFunction and what ?
Dec 14 10:15:33 <lufimtse>	Just that at the moment. evaluate() arrary support should be done this week, which I needed to get done for function to function also.
Dec 14 10:15:40 <lufimtse>	Rest are bugfixes.
Dec 14 10:15:47 <lufimtse>	afaik
Dec 14 10:15:53 <lufimtse>	but there might be more hidden gems.
Dec 14 10:15:55 <akurtakov_>	fwiw, this would be the deliverable for the team for the Carnation release
Dec 14 10:16:05 <lufimtse>	Carnation?
Dec 14 10:16:10 <akurtakov_>	yes
Dec 14 10:16:22 <akurtakov_>	the developer program release
Dec 14 10:16:25 <lufimtse>	I see
Dec 14 10:18:05 <akurtakov_>	so we have 3 things
Dec 14 10:18:18 <akurtakov_>	webkit2 webfunction working for this release
Dec 14 10:18:22 <akurtakov_>	wayland improvements
Dec 14 10:18:28 <akurtakov_>	and target platform editor
Dec 14 10:19:00 <lufimtse>	When does the release occur again?
Dec 14 10:21:03 <akurtakov_>	mid Feb
Dec 14 10:21:14 <lufimtse>	I see
Dec 14 10:21:20 <akurtakov_>	Feb 21 
Dec 14 11:15:10 <lufimtse>	Ian often comes by to consult on bugs. We talked about the DnD patch. Fill will probably move some selection logic from mouse click to mouse release if there is an existing selection.
Dec 14 11:15:20 <lufimtse>	s/Fill/Fix
Dec 14 12:05:45 <akurtakov_>	mouse release or mouse click ?
Dec 14 14:30:01 <lufimtse>	hullo
Dec 14 14:30:10 <lufimtse>	is there a way to see which platforms swt supports?
Dec 14 14:30:19 <lufimtse>	there are bits and pieces here and there
Dec 14 14:30:25 <lufimtse>	Is there a definite list?
Dec 14 14:30:41 <lufimtse>	Like I forgot about AIX and HPUX support, which are supported, which not etc... 
Dec 14 14:31:48 <akurtakov_>	sure there is http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.binaries.git/tree/pom.xml#n57
Dec 14 14:32:31 <lufimtse>	aha
Dec 14 14:32:34 <lufimtse>	Thank you.
Dec 14 14:49:51 <lufimtse>	btw, you know in os_custom.h we do things like: #define gdk_rgba_parse_LIB LIB_GDK for dynamic functions.
Dec 14 14:49:59 <lufimtse>	Is that actually used anywhere?
Dec 14 14:50:09 <lufimtse>	Just looking at src code.
Dec 14 14:50:36 <akurtakov_>	yes, it's used by the load function to know on which so file to call dlsym
Dec 14 14:51:45 <lufimtse>	I see
Dec 14 14:52:01 <lufimtse>	macro constructs macro.
Dec 14 14:52:51 <akurtakov_>	swt.h#145

Dec 14 14:53:26 <akurtakov_>	knowing which so file to open to dlsym on the next line
Dec 14 14:53:51 <lufimtse>	Was investigating because I was investigating how webkit loads functions dynamically. But for webkit it has it's own WebKitGTK_LOAD_FUNCTION(..) shinanigen.
Dec 14 14:54:02 <lufimtse>	so that lib-linking is not needed by the looks.
Dec 14 14:54:25 <akurtakov_>	yeah, webkit does it differently
Dec 14 14:56:03 <akurtakov_>	this reminds me I can get rid of 2 more bindings from OS.java tomorrow
Dec 14 14:56:10 <lufimtse>	One project, given time, I could spend some time automating generation of glue code. I have an understanding of what to do and how to do it. But it would take me some time :-). Maybe some day.
Dec 14 14:56:23 <akurtakov_>	don't rush
Dec 14 14:56:31 <akurtakov_>	macos does it properly
Dec 14 14:56:38 <akurtakov_>	if/when we decide to automate it
Dec 14 14:56:43 <akurtakov_>	we will use gir files
Dec 14 14:56:47 <lufimtse>	gir?
Dec 14 14:57:23 <lufimtse>	Like I have an idea on how to automate generation of dynamic functions. I could simply read a property flag defined in java and output the correct lib link.
Dec 14 14:57:33 <akurtakov_>	see /usr/share/gir-1.0/Gtk-3.0.gir
Dec 14 14:58:10 <akurtakov_>	gobject-introspection - the official way for generating bindings for glib/gobject based libs
Dec 14 14:58:18 <akurtakov_>	but this is pending on gtk2 removal too
Dec 14 14:58:24 <akurtakov_>	as it was added in gtk3
Dec 14 14:59:14 <lufimtse>	Well, that approach uses a run-time as oppose to actually statically linking. That's like x4 slower than static linking. 
Dec 14 14:59:17 <akurtakov_>	well, in newer glib than gtk 2.24 requires to be exact
Dec 14 14:59:20 <lufimtse>	For each call
Dec 14 14:59:26 <akurtakov_>	nope, 
Dec 14 14:59:30 <akurtakov_>	not mandatory
Dec 14 14:59:53 <akurtakov_>	it's plain data on which we can generate whether static or dynamic binding
Dec 14 15:00:28 <lufimtse>	Interesting.
Dec 14 15:00:38 <akurtakov_>	see the gir file
Dec 14 15:01:10 <akurtakov_>	I envision smth like the MacGenerator view
Dec 14 15:01:19 <akurtakov_>	in swt tools
Dec 14 15:01:23 <akurtakov_>	but for Gtk
Dec 14 15:01:28 <akurtakov_>	aka GtkGenerator
Dec 14 15:01:29 <lufimtse>	MacGenerator automatically builds the bindings?
Dec 14 15:01:35 <akurtakov_>	yes
Dec 14 15:01:40 <lufimtse>	Interesting. 
Dec 14 15:01:43 <akurtakov_>	based on file similar to the gir file
Dec 14 15:01:45 <akurtakov_>	:)
Dec 14 15:02:21 <lufimtse>	That's interesting. That'd be something for me to work on. (After Webkit2 port, Wayland fix up... )
Dec 14 15:02:42 <akurtakov_>	and after we dropped gtk2 :)
Dec 14 15:06:23 <akurtakov_>	look at e.g. bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT PI/cocoa/org/eclipse/swt/internal/cocoa/AppKitFull.bridgesupport

Jan 30 11:01:07 <akurtakov_>	we should better see him report bug
Jan 30 11:01:17 <akurtakov_>	and try to convince him to move to gtk3
Jan 30 11:02:01 <akurtakov_>	or at least find what's stopping them :)
Jan 30 11:02:07 <akurtakov_>	from using gtk3
Jan 30 11:02:38 <akurtakov_>	there is smth about error messages and documentation
Jan 30 11:02:51 <akurtakov_>	it shouldn't be too big - if it is people don't read it :)
Jan 30 11:03:18 <lufimtse>	My line of thought is that there are people on gtk2 (with SWT_GTK3=0), who now get into the situation where they no longer have webkit1 on the system.
Jan 30 11:03:27 <lufimtse>	but idk
Jan 30 11:03:49 <akurtakov_>	and we will not fix anything for them

Jan 30 11:04:16 <lufimtse>	not so much to fix things for them, but help them understand that they need to move to gtk3 :-)
Jan 30 11:04:36 <lufimtse>	just a thought. . 
Jan 30 11:04:43 <lufimtse>	the solution does suggest to move to gtk3
Jan 30 11:04:45 <akurtakov_>	in this case add - Make sure you run on GTK3 
Jan 30 11:04:49 <akurtakov_>	:)

Feb 09 10:18:27 <akurtakov_>	I thought you in the past that you used to comment and postpone things that would have been up to half an hour to fix
Feb 09 10:18:36 <akurtakov_>	but I haven't seen such cases in the last few weeks
Feb 09 10:19:06 <akurtakov_>	what about actual bug fixes
Feb 09 10:19:11 <akurtakov_>	how do you proceed with them
Feb 09 10:20:10 <akurtakov_>	but overall comments like "I'll review" could be damaging
Feb 09 10:20:18 <lufimtse>	how so?
Feb 09 10:20:22 <akurtakov_>	as this is  a promise that you would do smth
Feb 09 10:20:34 <akurtakov_>	but you might be dragged into smth
Feb 09 10:20:38 <akurtakov_>	and forget about it
Feb 09 10:20:41 <lufimtse>	well, I started reviewing the patch
Feb 09 10:20:59 <akurtakov_>	which would give bad feelings
Feb 09 10:21:29 <lufimtse>	So you'd say just review the patch without posting "I'll review"
Feb 09 10:21:30 <lufimtse>	?
Feb 09 10:22:00 <akurtakov_>	yes, this way I would not lie if smth else more urgent comes up :)
Feb 09 10:22:05 <lufimtse>	I see
Feb 09 10:22:27 <akurtakov_>	it's about setting expectations :)
Feb 09 10:23:18 <lufimtse>	that's a fair point.
Feb 09 10:23:25 <lufimtse>	Anything else on your radar?
Feb 09 10:23:41 <akurtakov_>	nope
Feb 09 10:23:46 <akurtakov_>	I don't keep list of things
Feb 09 10:24:01 <akurtakov_>	whenever I spot smth I throw it out immediately towards you :)
Feb 09 10:24:19 <akurtakov_>	so how do we go with the in-place table editing bug
Feb 09 10:25:16 <lufimtse>	thank you. Keep feedback comming, very useful for personal development. Me / Eric are engaged in a series of widget sizing & visibility issues
Feb 09 10:25:21 <lufimtse>	which make up the table editing also
Feb 09 10:25:28 <lufimtse>	whiteboarding and all
Feb 09 10:25:33 <lufimtse>	there are a bunch of related bugs
Feb 09 10:25:34 <lufimtse>	0x0
Feb 09 10:25:36 <lufimtse>	set visible
Feb 09 10:25:38 <lufimtse>	table editing
Feb 09 10:25:45 <lufimtse>	table editing inside a tabfoldex
Feb 09 10:26:14 <lufimtse>	the regression seen in table editing is a 'tip of the iceberg'
Feb 09 10:26:19 <lufimtse>	we'll be fixing these one by one,
Feb 09 10:26:20 <akurtakov_>	I see
Feb 09 10:26:30 <lufimtse>	and then get to the table editing within context of tabfolder
Feb 09 10:26:31 <akurtakov_>	just asking as there was nothing in swt this week :)
Feb 09 10:26:39 <lufimtse>	this one might take a bit of time
Feb 09 10:26:48 <lufimtse>	kinda complex
Feb 09 10:26:55 <lufimtse>	we've been putting it off for a long time
Feb 09 10:27:05 <lufimtse>	but seems like it's time to look into it
Feb 09 10:27:15 <akurtakov_>	any ETA ?
Feb 09 10:27:34 <lufimtse>	at the moment we're still in the process of figuring out what's broken, hard to say eta atm
Feb 09 10:28:06 <lufimtse>	low level stuff, drawing, gdk window Z ordering, re-parenting,,
Feb 09 10:28:33 <akurtakov_>	well, ETA is for first parts of the fix to come
Feb 09 10:28:41 <akurtakov_>	as I assume they manifest in multiple ways
Feb 09 10:29:03 <lufimtse>	I think next week we would have some kind of eta
Feb 09 10:29:07 <akurtakov_>	ok
Feb 09 10:29:11 <lufimtse>	at the moment it would just be a wild guess
Feb 09 10:29:34 <akurtakov_>	please try to not make it another multi month thing without visible progress :)
Feb 09 10:29:38 <akurtakov_>	I have to run now ttyl
Feb 09 10:29:41 <lufimtse>	bay
Feb 09 10:29:44 <lufimtse>	bye*
Feb 12 14:25:52 <lufimtse>	u around?
[akurtakov_ has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-200-37.brq.redhat.com]
Feb 12 14:26:01 <akurtakov_>	what's up?
Feb 12 14:27:08 <lufimtse>	I tested this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/116927/  Looks good to me. Do you think I can merge?
Feb 12 14:29:17 <akurtakov_>	if you're confident in it
Feb 12 14:29:44 <akurtakov_>	I assume you have tried it thoroughly
Feb 12 14:29:55 <lufimtse>	yea
Feb 12 14:29:59 <lufimtse>	spent a couple of hours on it.
Feb 12 14:30:09 <akurtakov_>	in this case do it
Feb 12 14:30:11 <lufimtse>	ok.
Feb 12 16:28:41 <akurtakov_>	At the moment we're focused on gtk3 bug-fixes, but we would be happy to review patches.
Feb 12 16:28:59 <akurtakov_>	this is the kind of comments that don't really help
Feb 12 16:29:30 <lufimtse>	You mean this guy? https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=444560
Feb 12 16:29:56 <akurtakov_>	yes
Feb 12 16:30:07 <lufimtse>	Is it better to just set the meta data without comment?
Feb 12 16:30:23 <akurtakov_>	yes
Feb 12 16:30:27 <lufimtse>	Ok
Feb 12 16:30:34 <akurtakov_>	I mean you can speak for our team only
Feb 12 16:30:41 <akurtakov_>	not for IBM nor for other platform committers
Feb 12 16:30:44 <lufimtse>	Ah,
Feb 12 16:30:46 <lufimtse>	fair point
Feb 12 16:31:01 <lufimtse>	thanks for pointing this out.
Feb 12 16:31:11 <akurtakov_>	so just set the metadata without more info
Feb 12 16:31:35 <akurtakov_>	it is also to not set expectations again
Feb 12 16:31:36 <lufimtse>	ok
Feb 12 16:31:57 <akurtakov_>	with that you sign publicly to deliver more gtk3 fixes
Feb 12 16:32:09 <akurtakov_>	which I'll be chasing you for :P
Feb 12 16:32:27 <lufimtse>	:-D
Feb 12 16:32:49 <lufimtse>	Me/Eric were thinking of doing a Gtk3-Tree bug purge month
Feb 12 16:32:59 <lufimtse>	focus on Tree bugs
Feb 12 16:33:09 <lufimtse>	as this is the buggiest gtk3 widget atm
Feb 12 16:33:12 <akurtakov_>	I'm always scared when I hear of month long plans 
Feb 12 16:33:25 <lufimtse>	well, fix lots of tree bugs
Feb 12 16:33:30 <akurtakov_>	at longest it must be single sprint (aka 3 weeks) 
Feb 12 16:33:39 <akurtakov_>	with some deliverable at the end :)
Feb 12 16:35:42 <akurtakov_>	mind you that we have to do demos every 3 weeks and having 1/4 of the team being on SWT is already a hurdle to sneak in :)
Feb 12 16:36:14 <akurtakov_>	anyway, I'm going to bed
Feb 12 16:36:17 <akurtakov_>	g'night
Feb 12 16:36:18 <lufimtse>	night ngiht
