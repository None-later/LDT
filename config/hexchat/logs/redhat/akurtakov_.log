Aug 29 12:15:53 <lufimtse>	Hey
Aug 29 12:15:58 <lufimtse>	I don't have platform.ui commiter rights
Aug 29 12:16:04 <lufimtse>	I could test, but can't push
Aug 29 12:16:20 <lufimtse>	I'll test and leave feedback, I'll ping Scela after
Aug 29 12:16:41 <akurtakov_>	doh
Aug 29 12:16:44 <akurtakov_>	I screwed the message
Aug 29 12:16:53 <akurtakov_>	we need swt part of the patch to be backported
Aug 29 12:17:21 <akurtakov_>	https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/commit/?id=814a0209eb942b533de379b718596f1512e4b23c
Aug 29 12:19:07 <lufimtse>	the only SWT commit is this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77098/
Aug 29 12:19:33 <lufimtse>	So basically backport to maintenance
Aug 29 12:19:52 <lufimtse>	I think Ian is in the process of backporting it to maint at the moment
Aug 29 12:20:09 <lufimtse>	he went out for lunch, will followup with him after.
Aug 29 12:20:10 <akurtakov_>	ah nice
Aug 29 12:20:33 <akurtakov_>	please set the review flag for him
Aug 29 12:20:42 <akurtakov_>	in bz I mean
Aug 29 12:20:42 <lufimtse>	ah yea, thank you for reminder.
Aug 29 15:01:37 <lufimtse>	yea, ian is working on the backport atm
Aug 29 15:01:39 <lufimtse>	of that one.
Aug 29 15:02:01 <lufimtse>	the swt one. 
Aug 29 15:02:18 <lufimtse>	Just to clarify, should we also look into this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79948/ or leave it to platform guys?
Aug 29 15:10:59 <akurtakov_>	Dani merged it already
Aug 29 15:18:29 <lufimtse>	ok

[akurtakov_ has address ~akurtakov@vpn1-5-210.ams2.redhat.com]
Sep 13 10:53:12 <akurtakov_>	because the yellowish match better
Sep 13 10:53:17 <akurtakov_>	for his preference
Sep 13 10:53:32 <akurtakov_>	and this is the color_info on win (old release at least)
Sep 13 10:53:37 <akurtakov_>	not sure about win 10
Sep 13 10:53:51 <lufimtse>	hmm
Sep 13 10:54:34 <akurtakov_>	will we use my bluejeans

Sep 13 10:54:59 <lufimtse>	ok
Sep 13 11:02:41 <lufimtse>	Hmm. Maybe we should change the color of COLOR_INFO and use something like 'popover' colors instead.

Sep 13 11:02:45 <lufimtse>	I'll experiment.
Sep 13 11:02:49 <lufimtse>	on swt level...
Sep 13 11:03:07 <lufimtse>	that could fix a whole bunch of inverted color issues and Dani would be hapyp.
Sep 13 11:03:16 <akurtakov_>	no
Sep 13 11:03:29 <akurtakov_>	we can't change color_info on swt level
Sep 13 11:03:35 <akurtakov_>	as this would break real tooltips
Sep 13 11:03:39 <akurtakov_>	let's talk later
Sep 13 11:30:35 <akurtakov_>	5 more mins I need

Nov 22 10:55:01 <lufimtse>	hello
Nov 22 10:55:20 <akurtakov_>	so how is the array thing going ?
Nov 22 10:55:55 <lufimtse>	It's doable, just takes a bit of time. For now I'm working on the presentation for eclipse camp
Nov 22 10:56:14 <lufimtse>	I was thinking of first working on Browser Function
Nov 22 10:56:23 <akurtakov_>	ah ok
Nov 22 10:56:24 <lufimtse>	since evaluate() array is doable, just takes time.
Nov 22 10:56:29 <akurtakov_>	so what's the status there?
Nov 22 10:56:35 <lufimtse>	browser function?
Nov 22 10:56:40 <akurtakov_>	yup
Nov 22 10:56:58 <lufimtse>	I was given a pointer to new UI api, now gotta tinker around with it
Nov 22 10:57:08 <lufimtse>	see how I can get it to work with native snippet

Nov 22 11:11:45 <lufimtse>	i.e, we can register callback handlers
Nov 22 11:11:56 <akurtakov_>	I see 
Nov 22 11:13:08 <lufimtse>	I have some ideas on how to get things going.. Might take a bit of time.
Nov 22 11:13:18 <akurtakov_>	good

Dec 14 10:01:13 <lufimtse>	morning
Dec 14 10:04:07 <akurtakov_>	morning
Dec 14 10:04:41 <lufimtse>	Thanks for pinging me on Webkit2 progress. I need that sometimes :-). Otherwise sometimes I get carried away with stuff.
Dec 14 10:14:57 <akurtakov_>	so we are missing WebFunction and what ?
Dec 14 10:15:33 <lufimtse>	Just that at the moment. evaluate() arrary support should be done this week, which I needed to get done for function to function also.
Dec 14 10:15:40 <lufimtse>	Rest are bugfixes.
Dec 14 10:15:47 <lufimtse>	afaik
Dec 14 10:15:53 <lufimtse>	but there might be more hidden gems.
Dec 14 10:15:55 <akurtakov_>	fwiw, this would be the deliverable for the team for the Carnation release
Dec 14 10:16:05 <lufimtse>	Carnation?
Dec 14 10:16:10 <akurtakov_>	yes
Dec 14 10:16:22 <akurtakov_>	the developer program release
Dec 14 10:16:25 <lufimtse>	I see
Dec 14 10:18:05 <akurtakov_>	so we have 3 things
Dec 14 10:18:18 <akurtakov_>	webkit2 webfunction working for this release
Dec 14 10:18:22 <akurtakov_>	wayland improvements
Dec 14 10:18:28 <akurtakov_>	and target platform editor
Dec 14 10:19:00 <lufimtse>	When does the release occur again?
Dec 14 10:21:03 <akurtakov_>	mid Feb
Dec 14 10:21:14 <lufimtse>	I see
Dec 14 10:21:20 <akurtakov_>	Feb 21 
Dec 14 11:15:10 <lufimtse>	Ian often comes by to consult on bugs. We talked about the DnD patch. Fill will probably move some selection logic from mouse click to mouse release if there is an existing selection.
Dec 14 11:15:20 <lufimtse>	s/Fill/Fix
Dec 14 12:05:45 <akurtakov_>	mouse release or mouse click ?
Dec 14 14:30:01 <lufimtse>	hullo
Dec 14 14:30:10 <lufimtse>	is there a way to see which platforms swt supports?
Dec 14 14:30:19 <lufimtse>	there are bits and pieces here and there
Dec 14 14:30:25 <lufimtse>	Is there a definite list?
Dec 14 14:30:41 <lufimtse>	Like I forgot about AIX and HPUX support, which are supported, which not etc... 
Dec 14 14:31:48 <akurtakov_>	sure there is http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.binaries.git/tree/pom.xml#n57
Dec 14 14:32:31 <lufimtse>	aha
Dec 14 14:32:34 <lufimtse>	Thank you.
Dec 14 14:49:51 <lufimtse>	btw, you know in os_custom.h we do things like: #define gdk_rgba_parse_LIB LIB_GDK for dynamic functions.
Dec 14 14:49:59 <lufimtse>	Is that actually used anywhere?
Dec 14 14:50:09 <lufimtse>	Just looking at src code.
Dec 14 14:50:36 <akurtakov_>	yes, it's used by the load function to know on which so file to call dlsym
Dec 14 14:51:45 <lufimtse>	I see
Dec 14 14:52:01 <lufimtse>	macro constructs macro.
Dec 14 14:52:51 <akurtakov_>	swt.h#145
Dec 14 14:53:01 <akurtakov_>	err 144
Dec 14 14:53:04 <lufimtse>	found
Dec 14 14:53:06 <akurtakov_>	the dlopen
Dec 14 14:53:26 <akurtakov_>	knowing which so file to open to dlsym on the next line
Dec 14 14:53:51 <lufimtse>	Was investigating because I was investigating how webkit loads functions dynamically. But for webkit it has it's own WebKitGTK_LOAD_FUNCTION(..) shinanigen.
Dec 14 14:54:02 <lufimtse>	so that lib-linking is not needed by the looks.
Dec 14 14:54:25 <akurtakov_>	yeah, webkit does it differently
Dec 14 14:56:03 <akurtakov_>	this reminds me I can get rid of 2 more bindings from OS.java tomorrow
Dec 14 14:56:10 <lufimtse>	One project, given time, I could spend some time automating generation of glue code. I have an understanding of what to do and how to do it. But it would take me some time :-). Maybe some day.
Dec 14 14:56:23 <akurtakov_>	don't rush
Dec 14 14:56:31 <akurtakov_>	macos does it properly
Dec 14 14:56:38 <akurtakov_>	if/when we decide to automate it
Dec 14 14:56:43 <akurtakov_>	we will use gir files
Dec 14 14:56:47 <lufimtse>	gir?
Dec 14 14:57:23 <lufimtse>	Like I have an idea on how to automate generation of dynamic functions. I could simply read a property flag defined in java and output the correct lib link.
Dec 14 14:57:33 <akurtakov_>	see /usr/share/gir-1.0/Gtk-3.0.gir
Dec 14 14:58:10 <akurtakov_>	gobject-introspection - the official way for generating bindings for glib/gobject based libs
Dec 14 14:58:18 <akurtakov_>	but this is pending on gtk2 removal too
Dec 14 14:58:24 <akurtakov_>	as it was added in gtk3
Dec 14 14:59:14 <lufimtse>	Well, that approach uses a run-time as oppose to actually statically linking. That's like x4 slower than static linking. 
Dec 14 14:59:17 <akurtakov_>	well, in newer glib than gtk 2.24 requires to be exact
Dec 14 14:59:20 <lufimtse>	For each call
Dec 14 14:59:26 <akurtakov_>	nope, 
Dec 14 14:59:30 <akurtakov_>	not mandatory
Dec 14 14:59:53 <akurtakov_>	it's plain data on which we can generate whether static or dynamic binding
Dec 14 15:00:28 <lufimtse>	Interesting.
Dec 14 15:00:38 <akurtakov_>	see the gir file
Dec 14 15:01:10 <akurtakov_>	I envision smth like the MacGenerator view
Dec 14 15:01:19 <akurtakov_>	in swt tools
Dec 14 15:01:23 <akurtakov_>	but for Gtk
Dec 14 15:01:28 <akurtakov_>	aka GtkGenerator
Dec 14 15:01:29 <lufimtse>	MacGenerator automatically builds the bindings?
Dec 14 15:01:35 <akurtakov_>	yes
Dec 14 15:01:40 <lufimtse>	Interesting. 
Dec 14 15:01:43 <akurtakov_>	based on file similar to the gir file
Dec 14 15:01:45 <akurtakov_>	:)
Dec 14 15:02:21 <lufimtse>	That's interesting. That'd be something for me to work on. (After Webkit2 port, Wayland fix up... )
Dec 14 15:02:42 <akurtakov_>	and after we dropped gtk2 :)
Dec 14 15:06:23 <akurtakov_>	look at e.g. bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT PI/cocoa/org/eclipse/swt/internal/cocoa/AppKitFull.bridgesupport
Dec 14 15:06:35 <akurtakov_>	it's the same content as gir file
