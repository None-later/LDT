Aug 08 14:34:47 <ipun>	hey, it looks like the Problems view type of viewer doesnt support nested items. Do you think we should reevaluate what we need to do, or should i figure out a way to support nested items?
Aug 08 14:38:14 <lufimtse>	is it table based?
Aug 08 14:38:24 <ipun>	its tree based
Aug 08 14:38:30 <lufimtse>	sec
Aug 08 14:38:34 <ipun>	but i cant seem to find how its doing it
Aug 09 10:13:22 *	Disconnected (Connection reset by peer)

Aug 15 14:06:21 <ipun>	hey Leo, for the problems view enhancement, could you cc me and assign that to me? I cant seem to assign it to myself when its already assigned to someone else
Aug 15 15:10:48 <lufimtse>	hey
Aug 15 15:12:01 <lufimtse>	ipun, seems like you don't have admin rights yet
Aug 15 15:12:09 <lufimtse>	or some form of limited rights
Aug 15 15:12:18 <lufimtse>	I guess you must be contributor before you can hack bugzilla
Aug 15 15:50:00 <ipun>	hmm okay

Sep 06 14:24:53 <ipun>	hey i accidentally made some changes on master and commited it. How do i reset my master branch to connect back to the origin master?
Sep 06 14:28:15 <ipun>	nevermidn i fixed it
Sep 06 14:44:39 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 06 14:44:41 <lufimtse>	ok
Sep 06 14:49:40 <ipun>	also im moving over to oxygen right now, did you have any trouble doing it with your worksapce?
Sep 06 14:50:37 <ipun>	as in, is there anything i need to do besides downloading the latest version, running it, and opening my previous workspace with it?
Sep 06 14:51:15 <lufimtse>	I'm on nightly, I live on the edge all the time.
Sep 06 14:51:29 <lufimtse>	In general, I haven't had a broken workspace in a long time.
Sep 06 14:51:33 <lufimtse>	but sometimes it breaks
Sep 06 14:51:40 <lufimtse>	my workspaces typically last a year or so
Sep 06 14:51:42 <ipun>	ah i think its cause i dont have git installed on elcipse
Sep 06 14:52:08 <lufimtse>	The nightly approach works well to be honest, no glitchy behaviour
Sep 06 14:52:16 <lufimtse>	but you're up to date with latest patches.
Sep 06 14:52:29 <lufimtse>	Good to make a backup before an update thou
Sep 06 14:52:35 <lufimtse>	I don't pull nightly every day
Sep 06 14:52:39 <lufimtse>	only maybe once every 2-3 week
Sep 06 14:52:40 <lufimtse>	s
Sep 06 14:52:44 <lufimtse>	or when I want a bugfix
Sep 06 14:52:47 <ipun>	ah i see
Sep 06 14:52:53 <ipun>	i got it working now; it was the missing git plugin
Sep 06 14:52:57 <lufimtse>	kk
Sep 06 14:53:01 <lufimtse>	I might blog about it.
Sep 06 14:53:05 <lufimtse>	I set up a domain for my blog
Sep 06 14:53:10 <ipun>	i saw,
Sep 06 14:54:34 <ipun>	whats the purpose of mattermost anyways?
Sep 06 14:54:50 <ipun>	considering we do most of our stuff on IRC, im trying to find a point to need to run another client just for SWT
Sep 06 15:00:59 <ipun>	also are you getting any bounds errors when running your gtk_version_tests script?
Sep 06 15:01:20 <ipun>	hard to tell if this was cuased by my bugfix or not
Sep 06 15:01:40 <lufimtse>	bounds error ?
Sep 06 15:01:41 <lufimtse>	no
Sep 06 15:01:46 <ipun>	hmm...
Sep 06 15:01:51 <lufimtse>	MatterMost is not just for SWT
Sep 06 15:01:58 <ipun>	only on 3.10 and 2.24
Sep 06 15:01:58 <lufimtse>	It's like slack but for all of eclipse
Sep 06 15:02:07 <ipun>	oh i see
Sep 06 15:02:09 <lufimtse>	swt is a channel
Sep 06 15:02:17 <lufimtse>	but there is platform channel, CDT, equinox etc..
Sep 06 15:02:36 <lufimtse>	Consider joining mattermost#Platform: SWT
Sep 06 15:02:44 <lufimtse>	most SWT dev's joined in.
Sep 06 15:05:23 <ipun>	kk im going to switch over to master branch and rerun some of the tests
Sep 06 15:05:34 <ipun>	really odd, im wondering if its my vm causing the bound issues
Sep 06 15:05:35 <lufimtse>	kk
Sep 06 15:05:46 <lufimtse>	woot bound issues?
Sep 06 15:24:30 <ipun>	hey lufimtse im also having issues with garrit today...it doesnt seem to be updating bugs.eclipse correctly when ive commited
Sep 06 15:24:49 <lufimtse>	Mine neither
Sep 06 15:24:53 <lufimtse>	probably gerrit broken
Sep 06 15:24:54 <lufimtse>	wait a day
Sep 06 15:24:57 <ipun>	okay cool
Sep 06 15:25:04 <lufimtse>	if still continues, we should investigate
Sep 07 11:13:45 *	Disconnected (Connection timed out)
Sep 08 14:08:30 <ipun>	my nightly build is extracte
Sep 08 14:08:35 <ipun>	extracted*
Sep 08 15:14:45 <ipun>	hey so im still gettting the git error, i dont htink its related to my mylyn stuff
