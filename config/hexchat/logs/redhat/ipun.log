Aug 08 14:34:47 <ipun>	hey, it looks like the Problems view type of viewer doesnt support nested items. Do you think we should reevaluate what we need to do, or should i figure out a way to support nested items?
Aug 08 14:38:14 <lufimtse>	is it table based?
Aug 08 14:38:24 <ipun>	its tree based
Aug 08 14:38:30 <lufimtse>	sec

Sep 06 14:24:53 <ipun>	hey i accidentally made some changes on master and commited it. How do i reset my master branch to connect back to the origin master?
Sep 06 14:28:15 <ipun>	nevermidn i fixed it
Sep 06 14:44:39 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 06 14:44:41 <lufimtse>	ok
Sep 06 14:49:40 <ipun>	also im moving over to oxygen right now, did you have any trouble doing it with your worksapce?
Sep 06 14:50:37 <ipun>	as in, is there anything i need to do besides downloading the latest version, running it, and opening my previous workspace with it?
Sep 06 14:51:15 <lufimtse>	I'm on nightly, I live on the edge all the time.
Sep 06 14:51:29 <lufimtse>	In general, I haven't had a broken workspace in a long time.
Sep 06 14:51:33 <lufimtse>	but sometimes it breaks
Sep 06 14:51:40 <lufimtse>	my workspaces typically last a year or so
Sep 06 14:51:42 <ipun>	ah i think its cause i dont have git installed on elcipse
Sep 06 14:52:08 <lufimtse>	The nightly approach works well to be honest, no glitchy behaviour
Sep 06 14:52:16 <lufimtse>	but you're up to date with latest patches.
Sep 06 14:52:29 <lufimtse>	Good to make a backup before an update thou
Sep 06 14:52:35 <lufimtse>	I don't pull nightly every day
Sep 06 14:52:39 <lufimtse>	only maybe once every 2-3 week
Sep 06 14:52:40 <lufimtse>	s
Sep 06 14:52:44 <lufimtse>	or when I want a bugfix
Sep 06 14:52:47 <ipun>	ah i see
Sep 06 14:52:53 <ipun>	i got it working now; it was the missing git plugin
Sep 06 14:52:57 <lufimtse>	kk
Sep 06 14:53:01 <lufimtse>	I might blog about it.
Sep 06 14:53:05 <lufimtse>	I set up a domain for my blog
Sep 06 14:53:10 <ipun>	i saw,
Sep 06 14:54:34 <ipun>	whats the purpose of mattermost anyways?
Sep 06 14:54:50 <ipun>	considering we do most of our stuff on IRC, im trying to find a point to need to run another client just for SWT
Sep 06 15:00:59 <ipun>	also are you getting any bounds errors when running your gtk_version_tests script?
Sep 06 15:01:20 <ipun>	hard to tell if this was cuased by my bugfix or not
Sep 06 15:01:40 <lufimtse>	bounds error ?
Sep 06 15:01:41 <lufimtse>	no
Sep 06 15:01:46 <ipun>	hmm...
Sep 06 15:01:51 <lufimtse>	MatterMost is not just for SWT
Sep 06 15:01:58 <ipun>	only on 3.10 and 2.24
Sep 06 15:01:58 <lufimtse>	It's like slack but for all of eclipse
Sep 06 15:02:07 <ipun>	oh i see
Sep 06 15:02:09 <lufimtse>	swt is a channel
Sep 06 15:02:17 <lufimtse>	but there is platform channel, CDT, equinox etc..
Sep 06 15:02:36 <lufimtse>	Consider joining mattermost#Platform: SWT
Sep 06 15:02:44 <lufimtse>	most SWT dev's joined in.
Sep 06 15:05:23 <ipun>	kk im going to switch over to master branch and rerun some of the tests
Sep 06 15:05:34 <ipun>	really odd, im wondering if its my vm causing the bound issues
Sep 06 15:05:35 <lufimtse>	kk
Sep 06 15:05:46 <lufimtse>	woot bound issues?
Sep 06 15:24:30 <ipun>	hey lufimtse im also having issues with garrit today...it doesnt seem to be updating bugs.eclipse correctly when ive commited
Sep 06 15:24:49 <lufimtse>	Mine neither
Sep 06 15:24:53 <lufimtse>	probably gerrit broken
Sep 06 15:24:54 <lufimtse>	wait a day
Sep 06 15:24:57 <ipun>	okay cool
Sep 06 15:25:04 <lufimtse>	if still continues, we should investigate

Oct 26 10:59:55 <lufimtse>	you could try to compile against 3.22 
Oct 26 11:00:23 <lufimtse>	maybe also try wiping everything and try to put jhbuild's git into ~/jhbuild
Oct 26 11:00:36 <lufimtse>	not sure if that would make any difference.. but who konws...
Oct 26 11:00:49 <lufimtse>	maybe reboot system after initial install of jhbuild
Oct 26 11:00:58 <lufimtse>	just to update path variable
Oct 26 11:01:13 <lufimtse>	maybe fish is to blame
Oct 26 11:01:24 <lufimtse>	try to do the whole setup with regular bash
Oct 26 11:01:35 <ipun>	okay
Oct 26 11:01:36 <lufimtse>	because fish has a different way of setting paths and env vars I think,
Oct 26 11:02:20 <lufimtse>	Fish I think is the only thing that could be causing issues...

Nov 14 12:46:21 <ipun>	hey leo do you mind you come over in a sec to discuss some new stuff i found out aobut dnd?
Nov 14 12:47:52 <lufimtse>	sure
Nov 14 14:53:37 <ipun>	so i added the listeners to dragbegin
Nov 14 14:53:42 <ipun>	but i dont think its picking up the signal from gtk
Nov 14 14:53:59 <lufimtse>	hm
Nov 14 14:54:30 <ipun>	it seems to only work when SWT.DragDetect is used
Nov 14 14:54:45 <ipun>	since that event is logged, and is only sent when dragEvent() is ran
Nov 15 10:29:09 <ipun>	it looks like we might have to redo drag source quite a bit to fix this

Nov 15 16:42:15 <ipun>	damn the scripts broken again
Nov 15 16:42:27 <lufimtse>	which script?
Nov 15 16:42:28 <ipun>	i think its cause i switched over to a really old checkout and back to master
Nov 15 16:42:30 <ipun>	brb
Nov 15 16:42:37 <lufimtse>	the build script?
Nov 15 16:42:41 <ipun>	yeah
Nov 15 16:42:46 <lufimtse>	lol yea.
Nov 15 16:42:55 <lufimtse>	you can invoke things manually thou.
Nov 15 16:43:00 <lufimtse>	like manually run the makefile
Nov 15 16:43:15 <lufimtse>	or simply copy the build.sh from the new repo to the checked out one
Nov 15 16:43:28 <ipun>	i actually just moved back to master
Nov 15 16:43:28 <lufimtse>	or copy it to some static location, and in the script add a line like

Nov 15 16:43:33 <lufimtse>	cd <LIB DIR>...

Nov 16 16:01:13 <ipun>	making the new executable
Nov 16 16:05:34 <lufimtse>	I think you can just manually make a makefile

Nov 16 16:05:43 <lufimtse>	Ignore the managed make project business
Nov 16 16:05:52 <lufimtse>	Documentation is badly out of date.
Nov 16 16:05:54 <lufimtse>	I should fix.
Nov 16 16:08:01 <ipun>	im just gonna skip that for now
Nov 16 16:08:10 <ipun>	and do the debug support compile of gtk
Nov 16 16:15:13 <lufimtse>	ok.
Nov 16 16:19:53 <ipun>	k i currently have my snippets running the .libs of the gtk i want
Nov 16 16:19:59 <ipun>	but im having trouble linking it to eclipse
Nov 16 16:41:53 <ipun>	cd
Nov 16 17:30:29 <lufimtse>	hey
Nov 16 17:30:40 <lufimtse>	k
Nov 17 10:01:05 <ipun>	hey whats the fastest way to recompile gtk with new printf statements?
Nov 17 10:01:48 <ipun>	would make CFLAGS="-g3 -ggdb3 -O0" -j4 work fine?
Nov 17 10:43:22 <lufimtse>	mostly yea
Nov 17 10:43:31 <ipun>	yeah figured that out 
Nov 17 10:43:35 <ipun>	but trheres more
Nov 17 12:28:41 <ipun>	k my next step is to play with your DND
Nov 17 12:28:58 <ipun>	since my pkgconfig doesnt work, whats the hack around for you to get it compiling with GTK?
Nov 17 12:29:31 <lufimtse>	hey
Nov 17 12:29:43 <lufimtse>	whut u mean
Nov 17 12:29:57 <lufimtse>	you mean use the gtk that you compiled
Nov 17 12:29:58 <lufimtse>	?
Nov 17 12:30:08 <lufimtse>	you be like 
Nov 17 12:30:09 <ipun>	your gtk code snippet you wrote on your github, id like to compile it. But the pkgconfig plugin is broken, you said you did some hacky things to get it working
Nov 17 12:30:19 <lufimtse>	makefile?
Nov 17 12:30:26 <ipun>	yeah? i thinkm,
Nov 17 12:30:28 <ipun>	think*
Nov 17 12:30:45 <lufimtse>	pkgconfig is specified in the makefile
Nov 17 12:30:48 <lufimtse>	it makes it for you.
Nov 17 12:30:59 <lufimtse>	go to command line
Nov 17 12:31:01 <lufimtse>	run
Nov 17 12:31:02 <lufimtse>	make
Nov 17 12:31:03 <lufimtse>	be happy
Nov 17 12:31:15 <lufimtse>	:-)
Nov 17 12:31:20 <ipun>	k basically your saying make my own makefile
Nov 17 12:31:22 <ipun>	got it
Nov 17 12:31:25 <lufimtse>	it should be in the project
Nov 17 12:31:29 <lufimtse>	I think?
Nov 17 12:31:30 <ipun>	ah yes it is
Nov 17 12:31:33 <ipun>	sounds good
Nov 17 12:31:39 <lufimtse>	to use the compiled gtk 
Nov 17 12:31:47 <lufimtse>	you set LD_LIBRATFSTF_PATH
Nov 17 12:31:54 <lufimtse>	like
Nov 17 12:31:58 <lufimtse>	export ... 
Nov 17 12:32:03 <lufimtse>	I think I mentioned somewhere in guide
Nov 17 12:32:29 <lufimtse>	export LD_LIBRARY_....=:/home/.../git/gtk.....
Nov 17 12:32:34 <ipun>	yes 
Nov 17 12:32:42 <lufimtse>	similar to waht u do in swt, just 'exprot' in command line
Nov 17 12:32:48 <lufimtse>	or what ever fish usese.
Nov 17 12:41:26 <ipun>	gotcha
Nov 17 14:47:10 <lufimtse>	relevant:
Nov 17 14:47:11 <lufimtse>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26410896/workaround-for-making-gtk-label-a-drag-source
Nov 17 14:47:16 <lufimtse>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7704017/pygobject-creating-a-drag-and-drop-source
Nov 17 14:47:19 <lufimtse>	I'm also thinking:
Nov 17 14:47:41 <lufimtse>	Maybe manual DND detection was implemented in SWT because not all GTK widgets support DnD
Nov 17 14:48:06 <lufimtse>	we also don't know if label is the only widget with the issue.
Nov 17 14:48:14 <lufimtse>	there might be other widgets with the dnd issue.
Nov 17 14:50:52 <ipun>	i played with dnd example already
Nov 17 14:50:54 <ipun>	label is the only one
Nov 17 14:51:13 <lufimtse>	Does DnDExample contain all widgets?
Nov 17 14:51:38 <lufimtse>	also I'd experiment with nested widgets, like dnd of buttons inside a group
Nov 17 14:51:48 <ipun>	kk
Nov 17 14:52:28 <lufimtse>	try dnd in a child Eclipse, try DnD in staging area when it's minimized and you briefly click on it so that it overlaps the main editor
Nov 17 14:52:45 <ipun>	kk
Nov 17 14:53:31 <lufimtse>	http://i.imgur.com/KimgeIV.png  << Like when you minimize the toolbar, but click on the git-staging area and try to drag files in the staging area.
Nov 17 14:53:42 <lufimtse>	(see right side of picture)
Nov 17 14:53:58 <lufimtse>	we had issues with overlapping widgets.
Nov 17 15:08:48 <ipun>	it works :)
Nov 17 15:08:54 <ipun>	but i will debug
Nov 17 16:14:44 <ipun>	hey do you have time to run snippet 84 on yours for me?

Nov 28 11:18:26 <lufimtse>	hey
Nov 28 11:18:27 <ipun>	i think it might be some flag?
Nov 28 11:26:48 <lufimtse>	maybeh

Nov 28 14:32:57 <ipun>	hey whenyou are free after lunch, could you show me how to build a child eclipse and run it?
Nov 28 14:33:21 <lufimtse>	hey
Nov 28 14:33:26 <lufimtse>	you mean like from Maven?
Nov 28 14:33:29 <ipun>	yeah 
Nov 28 14:33:35 <lufimtse>	Oh God.
Nov 28 14:33:37 <lufimtse>	idk
Nov 28 14:33:42 <ipun>	like, how is it building right now
Nov 28 14:33:47 <lufimtse>	hmm
Nov 28 14:33:51 <ipun>	is it keeping some sort of binaries somewhere?
Nov 28 14:33:52 <lufimtse>	do I have any docu on this...
Nov 28 14:33:58 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Nov 28 14:34:56 <lufimtse>	I only know how to use maven to build SWT stuff,
Nov 28 14:34:58 <lufimtse>	meh
Nov 28 14:35:06 <lufimtse>	Roland is your man for building all of eclipse
Nov 28 14:35:14 <ipun>	oaky sure
Dec 02 10:01:21 <ipun>	thought about it for a while overnight, i think its best we do plan B
Dec 02 10:01:34 <lufimtse>	Let's try plan b.
Dec 02 10:01:36 <lufimtse>	btw
Dec 02 10:01:42 <lufimtse>	I may have some work if interested.
Dec 02 10:01:53 <lufimtse>	I think we need a new color in SWT called COLOR_ENTRY
Dec 02 10:01:53 <ipun>	swt or platform?
Dec 02 10:01:58 <ipun>	ooo
Dec 02 10:02:00 <ipun>	to control example?
Dec 02 10:02:01 <lufimtse>	that involves some cross platform work.
Dec 02 10:02:08 <lufimtse>	Like new color new color.
Dec 02 10:02:18 <lufimtse>	We don't have a system color for Entry
Dec 02 10:02:21 <lufimtse>	only for 'list'
Dec 02 10:02:39 <lufimtse>	even our Text widget, which is a gtk_entry_ uses LIST_*
Dec 02 10:02:53 <lufimtse>	because of this we have a number of color issues in platform
Dec 02 10:03:38 <lufimtse>	this is relativley important, so if tired of DnD, something worth while doing...
Dec 02 10:04:16 <ipun>	sounds good
Dec 02 10:04:23 <ipun>	ill let you know once DND drains me
Dec 02 10:04:31 <ipun>	right now I am going to do my best

Feb 09 10:07:56 <ipun>	i think i might have to do a git bisect to see which version of gtk is causing the issue
Feb 09 10:08:06 <lufimtse>	hmm
Feb 09 10:08:07 <ipun>	did you write a post abouthow to do that somewhere?
Feb 09 10:08:22 <lufimtse>	in my private notes :-)
Feb 09 10:08:23 <lufimtse>	sec
Feb 09 10:08:37 <ipun>	if you tell me
Feb 09 10:08:43 <ipun>	ill credit you in my first blog post./
Feb 09 10:08:54 <lufimtse>	To start:
Feb 09 10:08:55 <lufimtse>		git bisect start
Feb 09 10:08:55 <lufimtse>		git bisect good fd0a623
Feb 09 10:08:55 <lufimtse>		git bisect bad 256d850
Feb 09 10:09:01 <lufimtse>	Tell git if commit was good or bad till you find commit
Feb 09 10:09:01 <lufimtse>		git bisect good
Feb 09 10:09:01 <lufimtse>		..
Feb 09 10:09:01 <lufimtse>		git bisect bad
Feb 09 10:09:06 <ipun>	right
Feb 09 10:09:06 <lufimtse>	End git bisect
Feb 09 10:09:06 <lufimtse>		git bisect reset
Feb 09 10:09:14 <ipun>	but how do you build the gtk bindings again
Feb 09 10:09:19 <lufimtse>	lol

Feb 10 11:26:18 <ipun>	damn
Feb 10 11:26:24 <ipun>	so i got the caret working FINALLY
Feb 10 11:26:25 <lufimtse>	what goes
Feb 10 11:26:27 <lufimtse>	oh
Feb 10 11:26:29 <lufimtse>	naice
Feb 10 11:26:30 <ipun>	but it doesnt work above 3.14
Feb 10 11:26:39 <ipun>	BECAUSE of the performance problem we discussed
Feb 10 11:26:39 <lufimtse>	meh?
Feb 10 11:26:42 <lufimtse>	heh
Feb 10 11:26:45 <lufimtse>	that sucks
Feb 10 11:26:46 <ipun>	i had a bad feeling it was going to cause issues
Feb 10 11:26:50 <lufimtse>	hmm
Feb 10 11:26:52 <lufimtse>	interesting
Feb 10 11:27:00 <lufimtse>	you sure it's the performance issue?
Feb 10 11:27:09 <lufimtse>	shouldn't it work like 5 seconds after moving mouse
Feb 10 11:27:23 <lufimtse>	?
Feb 10 11:27:30 <ipun>	it should, but because of some of the logic in my code currently, it gets stuck in a loop
Feb 10 11:28:07 <ipun>	ill investigate further, im just glad the caret is drawing now
Feb 10 11:31:58 <ipun>	stupid layering issue
Feb 10 11:42:26 <lufimtse>	hmm
Feb 10 11:43:23 <ipun>	either way i think the main problem is it sending draw signals consistantly in the first place

Feb 14 09:49:48 <ipun>	hey leo, alex said that my dnd patch shouldnt have a new public api for Control. Would it be okay in that way to use instances? I cant think of any better way
Feb 14 09:50:01 <lufimtse>	hhmm
Feb 14 09:50:10 <lufimtse>	why public api
Feb 14 09:50:16 <lufimtse>	you mean protected?
Feb 14 09:50:17 <lufimtse>	method?
Feb 14 09:50:44 <ipun>	public method that does nothing and is meant to be overriden
Feb 14 09:50:54 <lufimtse>	lemme checks
Feb 14 09:50:57 <ipun>	kk

Mar 13 12:13:32 <ipun>	nope.
Mar 13 12:13:34 <ipun>	:(
Mar 13 15:44:38 <ipun>	hey leo i forgot to grab a new litter box this weekend. Im slightly busy tonight to pick one up from the dollar store; if you happen to be around one, did you want to get one in prep for your own cat as well?
Mar 13 15:44:57 <lufimtse>	yes
Mar 13 15:45:03 <lufimtse>	I can get one.
Mar 13 15:45:10 <lufimtse>	When do I pickup cat from you again?
Mar 13 15:45:21 <ipun>	Wednesday
Mar 13 15:45:37 <ipun>	ill likely just rent a car 
Mar 13 15:45:58 <lufimtse>	that could work. But I could take the cat home with me via subway also
Mar 13 15:46:19 <lufimtse>	It would then be short walk from office to subway an short walk from subway to home
Mar 13 15:46:32 <lufimtse>	I live about 6 min walk from subway
Mar 13 15:46:56 <lufimtse>	Or even bus from Eglington station goes directly to my home.
Mar 13 15:47:12 <lufimtse>	Do you live close enough to walk with the cat to the office?
Mar 13 15:47:30 <lufimtse>	Let's talk talk.
