Aug 08 14:34:47 <ipun>	hey, it looks like the Problems view type of viewer doesnt support nested items. Do you think we should reevaluate what we need to do, or should i figure out a way to support nested items?
Aug 08 14:38:14 <lufimtse>	is it table based?
Aug 08 14:38:24 <ipun>	its tree based
Aug 08 14:38:30 <lufimtse>	sec
Aug 08 14:38:34 <ipun>	but i cant seem to find how its doing it

Aug 15 14:06:21 <ipun>	hey Leo, for the problems view enhancement, could you cc me and assign that to me? I cant seem to assign it to myself when its already assigned to someone else
Aug 15 15:10:48 <lufimtse>	hey
Aug 15 15:12:01 <lufimtse>	ipun, seems like you don't have admin rights yet
Aug 15 15:12:09 <lufimtse>	or some form of limited rights
Aug 15 15:12:18 <lufimtse>	I guess you must be contributor before you can hack bugzilla
Aug 15 15:50:00 <ipun>	hmm okay
