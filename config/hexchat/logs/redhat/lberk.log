Aug 05 15:54:50 <lberk>	be careful with the panel you end up getting
Aug 05 15:55:07 <lufimtse>	in what way?
Aug 05 15:55:09 <lberk>	I've heard mixed reviews for long term eye health of panels that use PWM
Aug 05 15:55:24 <lufimtse>	Oh, interesting.
Aug 05 15:55:50 <lberk>	when I went for a high quality monitor for home use, the only panels that didn't use PWM for brightness was dell
Aug 05 15:55:58 <lberk>	that may have changed since then though
Aug 05 15:56:51 <lufimtse>	thank you for letting me know. I may end up with one of the Dell screens
Aug 05 15:58:34 <lberk>	well. do your own research, might be something you're not actually concerned about, and might end up getting a better monitor for much cheaper
Aug 05 15:58:42 <lberk>	also, let me know if you manage to expense it ;)
Aug 05 15:59:28 <lufimtse>	I haven't planned on expensing it, was thinking about just getting it on my own budget, meh (?)
Aug 05 15:59:39 <lberk>	heh, ya that was a joke.
Aug 05 15:59:44 <lufimtse>	X-D

Sep 13 15:35:10 <lberk>	please be a considerate office member in the future, when you borrow tools, such as a screwdriver, please put them back as soon as you're done with them
Sep 13 15:35:20 <lberk>	that way people don't have to go looking around for things when they need them
Sep 13 15:35:58 <lufimtse>	Oh, I forgot to put the screwdriver back? My appologies. Thank you for pointing out.
