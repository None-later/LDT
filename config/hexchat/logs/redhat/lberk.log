Aug 05 15:54:50 <lberk>	be careful with the panel you end up getting
Aug 05 15:55:07 <lufimtse>	in what way?
Aug 05 15:55:09 <lberk>	I've heard mixed reviews for long term eye health of panels that use PWM
Aug 05 15:55:24 <lufimtse>	Oh, interesting.
Aug 05 15:55:50 <lberk>	when I went for a high quality monitor for home use, the only panels that didn't use PWM for brightness was dell
Aug 05 15:55:58 <lberk>	that may have changed since then though
Aug 05 15:56:51 <lufimtse>	thank you for letting me know. I may end up with one of the Dell screens
Aug 05 15:58:34 <lberk>	well. do your own research, might be something you're not actually concerned about, and might end up getting a better monitor for much cheaper
Aug 05 15:58:42 <lberk>	also, let me know if you manage to expense it ;)
Aug 05 15:59:28 <lufimtse>	I haven't planned on expensing it, was thinking about just getting it on my own budget, meh (?)
Aug 05 15:59:39 <lberk>	heh, ya that was a joke.
Aug 05 15:59:44 <lufimtse>	X-D

Sep 13 15:34:42 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 13 15:34:43 <lufimtse>	sup
Sep 13 15:35:10 <lberk>	please be a considerate office member in the future, when you borrow tools, such as a screwdriver, please put them back as soon as you're done with them
Sep 13 15:35:20 <lberk>	that way people don't have to go looking around for things when they need them
Sep 13 15:35:58 <lufimtse>	Oh, I forgot to put the screwdriver back? My appologies. Thank you for pointing out.

Dec 23 11:28:05 <lberk>	have you considered reaching out to jen krieger about your agile question?
Dec 23 11:28:14 <lberk>	she'd probably have a bunch of good suggestions
Dec 23 11:33:27 <lufimtse>	hey
Dec 23 11:33:36 <lufimtse>	jen krieger?
Dec 23 11:36:44 <lberk>	she did a tech talk on the subject
Dec 23 11:37:01 <lufimtse>	Interesting. Thank you for the suggestion.

Mar 10 15:16:56 <lberk>	you know that all those fancy diagrams and graphs, time tracking, can be done in emacs org-mode, right?
Mar 10 15:17:06 <lberk>	http://ehneilsen.net/notebook/orgExamples/org-examples.html
Mar 10 15:17:26 <lufimtse>	:-)
Mar 10 15:17:28 <lberk>	(5.4)
Mar 10 15:17:36 <lufimtse>	I used to make those diagrams in emacs before
Mar 10 15:17:50 <lufimtse>	but there was some tension with me being an Eclipse developer and using emacs
Mar 10 15:17:58 <lberk>	pfft
Mar 10 15:18:02 <lufimtse>	my emacs file was like 1000+ lines long. 
Mar 10 15:18:08 <lufimtse>	but then I forgot what it did
Mar 10 15:18:19 <lufimtse>	config bankrupcy X-D
Mar 10 15:18:56 <lufimtse>	I kinda felt a bit of repetative tunnel syndrome
Mar 10 15:19:04 <lufimtse>	So I switched over to more mousing 
Mar 10 15:19:05 <lufimtse>	less typing
Mar 10 15:19:10 <lufimtse>	seems ok now
Mar 10 15:19:23 <lufimtse>	But emacs was nice while I was using it...
Mar 10 15:19:38 <lufimtse>	maybe someday when I do less java work, more C work or something like that....
Mar 10 15:20:07 <lberk>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mar 10 15:20:13 <lufimtse>	I know right ^_^
