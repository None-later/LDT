Aug 05 15:54:50 <lberk>	be careful with the panel you end up getting
Aug 05 15:55:07 <lufimtse>	in what way?
Aug 05 15:55:09 <lberk>	I've heard mixed reviews for long term eye health of panels that use PWM
Aug 05 15:55:24 <lufimtse>	Oh, interesting.
Aug 05 15:55:50 <lberk>	when I went for a high quality monitor for home use, the only panels that didn't use PWM for brightness was dell
Aug 05 15:55:58 <lberk>	that may have changed since then though
Aug 05 15:56:51 <lufimtse>	thank you for letting me know. I may end up with one of the Dell screens
Aug 05 15:58:34 <lberk>	well. do your own research, might be something you're not actually concerned about, and might end up getting a better monitor for much cheaper
Aug 05 15:58:42 <lberk>	also, let me know if you manage to expense it ;)
Aug 05 15:59:28 <lufimtse>	I haven't planned on expensing it, was thinking about just getting it on my own budget, meh (?)
Aug 05 15:59:39 <lberk>	heh, ya that was a joke.

Sep 13 15:35:58 <lufimtse>	Oh, I forgot to put the screwdriver back? My appologies. Thank you for pointing out.

Dec 23 11:28:05 <lberk>	have you considered reaching out to jen krieger about your agile question?
Dec 23 11:28:14 <lberk>	she'd probably have a bunch of good suggestions
Dec 23 11:33:27 <lufimtse>	hey
Dec 23 11:33:36 <lufimtse>	jen krieger?
Dec 23 11:36:44 <lberk>	she did a tech talk on the subject
Dec 23 11:37:01 <lufimtse>	Interesting. Thank you for the suggestion.

Mar 10 15:16:56 <lberk>	you know that all those fancy diagrams and graphs, time tracking, can be done in emacs org-mode, right?
Mar 10 15:17:06 <lberk>	http://ehneilsen.net/notebook/orgExamples/org-examples.html
Mar 10 15:17:26 <lufimtse>	:-)
Mar 10 15:17:28 <lberk>	(5.4)
Mar 10 15:17:36 <lufimtse>	I used to make those diagrams in emacs before
Mar 10 15:17:50 <lufimtse>	but there was some tension with me being an Eclipse developer and using emacs
Mar 10 15:17:58 <lberk>	pfft
Mar 10 15:18:02 <lufimtse>	my emacs file was like 1000+ lines long. 
Mar 10 15:18:08 <lufimtse>	but then I forgot what it did
Mar 10 15:18:19 <lufimtse>	config bankrupcy X-D
Mar 10 15:18:56 <lufimtse>	I kinda felt a bit of repetative tunnel syndrome
Mar 10 15:19:04 <lufimtse>	So I switched over to more mousing 
Mar 10 15:19:05 <lufimtse>	less typing
Mar 10 15:19:10 <lufimtse>	seems ok now
Mar 10 15:19:23 <lufimtse>	But emacs was nice while I was using it...
Mar 10 15:19:38 <lufimtse>	maybe someday when I do less java work, more C work or something like that....
Mar 10 15:20:07 <lberk>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mar 10 15:20:13 <lufimtse>	I know right ^_^

Apr 24 14:35:16 <lberk>	if you don't mind, please make sure to have the new switch setup the friday before the newterns start (they start may 15th)
Apr 24 15:01:11 <lufimtse>	ok, thank you for heads up.
Apr 24 15:10:28 <lufimtse>	I'll buy a switch today/tomorrow and should have the big one returned by Wednesday.
Apr 24 16:14:34 <lberk>	no rush
Apr 24 16:14:43 <lberk>	just know it's coming down the pipes sooner rather than later
Apr 27 09:46:41 <lberk>	thanks for dropping off the switch
Apr 27 09:46:47 <lberk>	which one did you end up picking up?
Apr 27 09:46:54 <lufimtse>	hello
Apr 27 09:47:02 <lufimtse>	Cisco 5 port gb switch
Apr 27 09:47:13 <lufimtse>	seems to work well

Apr 27 13:59:54 <lberk>	aaaah shoot.  sorry Leo, I totally forgot to forward you an email

Apr 27 14:00:23 <lberk>	basically, we're getting ready for the newterns again, would you be willing to help present with jeff and roland about eclipse?
Apr 27 14:00:25 <lberk>	https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1130822 
Apr 27 14:00:31 <lberk>	if so, I need to add your name on that timeslot

Apr 27 14:01:36 <lufimtse>	I'll check with them.
Apr 27 14:01:40 <lberk>	thanks
Apr 27 14:05:07 <lufimtse>	Btw, if of use, I've been presenting an "Open source" presentation to CSC301 (software engineering) students in the last two semesters. I could present it to the interns if of use: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a_kx5mJkWZWXSIed4X9tmLTpd2nlZH42y570pbJibbI/edit?usp=sharing
Apr 27 14:05:17 <lufimtse>	talks about what is open source, linux etc...
Apr 27 14:05:19 <lufimtse>	history of linux
Apr 27 14:05:20 *	lberk looks
Apr 27 14:05:30 <lufimtse>	where red hat got it's name ...
Apr 27 14:05:43 <lberk>	aha, the one where you got the selfie with linus

Apr 27 14:05:52 <lufimtse>	Linux con
Apr 27 14:05:57 <lberk>	heh, yes I recall
Apr 27 14:06:21 <lufimtse>	emacs mentioned on slide 28
Apr 27 14:06:56 <lberk>	so, I appreciate it, but we already have these topics broadly covered
Apr 27 14:07:17 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 27 14:07:30 <lberk>	I will definitely let you know if you can help though, thanks
Apr 27 14:07:55 <lberk>	hmmm
Apr 27 14:08:08 <lberk>	slide 4 though..
Apr 27 14:08:25 <lberk>	I was of the inclination that it was due to marc ewin's lacrosse cap?
Apr 27 14:08:36 <lberk>	er, ewing*

Apr 27 14:09:40 <lufimtse>	I should add that he also wore the hat
Apr 27 14:09:49 <lufimtse>	slide 4 refers more to the "redness" of it.
Apr 27 14:10:00 <lufimtse>	thanks for slide review.
Apr 27 14:10:46 <lufimtse>	I added a todo in there.
Apr 27 14:12:52 <lberk>	heh, didn't mean to critique, just checking my own knowledge of rh
Apr 27 14:13:16 <lufimtse>	Hey, I welcome feedback with open arms.
Apr 27 14:13:19 <lufimtse>	makes presi better
Apr 27 14:13:19 <lberk>	heh, it's funny
Apr 27 14:13:24 <lufimtse>	let me know if you find anything else
Apr 27 14:13:28 <lberk>	reading about windows and super computers
Apr 27 14:13:47 <lberk>	when i was in 4th year and msft came to campus to try and sell us on working there, 3 engineers came that went to queens
Apr 27 14:14:10 <lberk>	one made a really big deal about how he was on the special team that got windows on one of the world's top 100 supercomputers
Apr 27 14:14:34 <lufimtse>	hmm, there are only 3 supercomputers in the top 100 that run windows..
Apr 27 14:14:34 <lufimtse>	atm
Apr 27 14:14:38 <lufimtse>	atm-ish
Apr 27 14:14:49 <lufimtse>	there is a windows supercomputer eddition
Apr 27 14:14:54 <lufimtse>	which is not used much
Apr 27 14:15:03 <lberk>	ya, just made me chuckle that it required a special team to have one on the list
Apr 27 14:33:53 <lufimtse>	yea. If you need someone to make a presentation on anything else (e.g bash/git/etc etc hacks), I'd be happy to pull something together. Just mentioning in case down the road you need someone make one.
Apr 27 14:36:27 <lberk>	much appreciated!

May 01 13:24:14 <lufimtse>	hey, btw the Eclipse talk on wednesday: 14:00 - 14:45	Eclipse Team Talk [Jeff, Roland, Leo, Ian]. Is it suppose to be technical (how eclipse works), or more like "this is what the Eclipse team does".
May 01 13:50:35 <lberk>	it is a talk introducing the eclipse team in toronto

May 01 13:50:51 <lufimtse>	ok.
May 01 13:51:56 <lufimtse>	will there be a session where we show them how to use Eclipse?

Dec 08 10:40:55 <lberk>	syncing calendar's like that is trivial?
Dec 08 10:43:06 <lufimtse>	lberk suggestion?
Dec 08 10:43:25 <lufimtse>	lberk the thought is to have work calendar show up in my personal gmail calendar.
Dec 08 10:43:47 <lufimtse>	currently the red hat google calendar doesn't show full detail, only grayed out blocks.
Dec 08 10:44:17 <lberk>	so to be clear, you're ok with it being a different 'calendar' on your calendar program, you just want proper access to it?
Dec 08 10:44:20 <lberk>	what phone OS do you have?
Dec 08 10:44:37 <lufimtse>	android
Dec 08 10:44:46 <lufimtse>	you mean set up work google calendar on my phone?
Dec 08 10:45:06 <lufimtse>	but then I'd still not be able to do that in a web browser.
Dec 08 10:45:25 <lufimtse>	unless I use work-calendar for all my personal stuff
Dec 08 10:45:30 <lufimtse>	(which I haven't tried...)
Dec 08 10:45:47 <lberk>	https://redhat.service-now.com/kb?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0004712
Dec 08 10:46:04 <lberk>	well, ultimately depends on how you do it
Dec 08 10:46:15 <lberk>	but web browser, aiui, that's a client limitation 
Dec 08 10:46:27 <lberk>	unless you share stuff back and forth, which I've not tried
Dec 08 10:47:15 <lufimtse>	well, I mean the point being is that if the red hat calendar could be shared to a non-red hat account (e.g my personal one), then it would just make life easier
Dec 08 10:47:32 <lberk>	ah, gotcha

Jan 11 14:25:50 <lberk>	but have it on the desk when you do it
Jan 11 14:25:54 <lberk>	it works laying flat on a desk
