Oct 19 16:38:31 <alanm>	Do they have Screen Sharing set to active and Remote Login to on on the Sharing dialog in Settings ?
Oct 19 16:39:00 <alanm>	Or is Sharing kept off because of the Security stuff ?
Oct 19 16:39:20 <alanm>	It may be because of the Stig stuff ?
Oct 19 16:42:57 <VishalP>	alanm, screen sharing option for vino is grayed out. 
Oct 19 16:47:49 <SilverSamurai|mtg>	Might want to check NetworkManager, as well as dconf locks
Oct 19 16:58:41 <alanm>	Could be because of STIG
