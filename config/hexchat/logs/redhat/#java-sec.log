Oct 18 10:13:54 *	Now talking on #java-sec
Oct 18 12:07:49 <gnu_andrew>	jerboaa: plus if you do 7.6 now, 7.7 may even be branched with those changes :)
Oct 18 12:08:14 <jerboaa>	thoger, https://docs.prodsec.redhat.com/rhsa_creation/ mentions I'd need docs role permissions for prerequisites. how do I find out whether I have it?
Oct 18 12:08:40 <jerboaa>	gnu_andrew, yes. thoger pointed that out
Oct 18 12:09:06 <gnu_andrew>	jerboaa: cool, just catching up :)
Oct 18 12:09:18 <jerboaa>	thanks anyways!
Oct 18 12:09:28 <gnu_andrew>	jerboaa: easiest way with the erratum would probably be to just clone the OpenJDK 8 7.6 one and alter as necessary
Oct 18 12:11:06 <gnu_andrew>	jerboaa: https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/37403
Oct 18 12:12:25 <jerboaa>	thoger, found it: https://errata.devel.redhat.com/user/show_roles I don't have Docs
Oct 18 12:12:39 <thoger>	jerboaa: docs role should only be required for approving docs, not writing
Oct 18 12:13:08 <jerboaa>	thoger, so I don't need to apply for the Docs role, then?
Oct 18 12:13:27 <thoger>	no
Oct 18 12:13:33 *	jerboaa is confused as it's listed as a prerequisite
Oct 18 12:14:51 <gnu_andrew>	jerboaa: neither do I, should be just the same as creating other errata in this case as it's not a security one
Oct 18 12:18:51 <thoger>	jerboaa: i think it's wrong.  it's recent(ish) change, and i'm going to ask to have that removed
Oct 18 12:19:12 <jerboaa>	thoger, cool. thanks.
Oct 18 12:23:20 <gnu_andrew>	yeah you need a role capable of creating errata, and we both have devel which allows that
