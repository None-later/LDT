Oct 22 14:47:57 <lufimtse>	 Hello guys. An FSI client needs to have an antivirus installed. (at the moment using symmantec). I understand Red Hat doesn't make or keep a list of recommend antivirus systems. But in your experience, are there any antivirus systems that work?or that we recomend? 
Oct 22 14:48:54 <lufimtse>	or at least something that scans and provides a report.
Oct 22 14:55:19 <scott>	Hi lufimtse, I do not know Red Hat's official policy/response regarding that question, but clamav may meet the needs. https://access.redhat.com/solutions/22007 details a bit about this.
