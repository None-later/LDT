Dec 19 16:19:07 *	Now talking on #fedora
Dec 19 16:19:07 *	Topic for #fedora is: This is not a support channel for Fedora users. Please seek help on the official Fedora support channels on irc.freenode.net. Thanks. --mgmt. This channel is for fedora-rh infrastructure issues

Dec 19 16:19:41 <lufimtse_>	Anyone been able to get Screen recording to work on Wayland/Fedora 27? The usual tools all fail. Shift+ctrl+alt+R seems to produce an empty video.
Dec 19 16:20:36 <mgalgoci>	logout and login as an X11 session instead of wayland
Dec 19 16:20:39 <mgalgoci>	it might work
Dec 19 16:20:46 <mgalgoci>	you select it on the GDM greeter
Dec 20 11:08:46 <mgalgoci>	smooge: the name of that company you were grasping for was Foundry Networks
Dec 20 11:10:17 <smooge>	ah
Dec 20 11:12:18 <mgalgoci>	I didn't remember either until I saw it on a mailing list
Dec 20 11:24:21 <smooge>	I found my memo-list archives from 1998
Dec 20 11:25:46 <smooge>	like 2 minutes before this started..
Dec 20 11:27:56 <mgalgoci>	I think the archives should be up on post-office.corp anyhow
Dec 20 11:28:04 <mgalgoci>	unless nate was ordered to delete them
Dec 20 11:29:19 <smooge>	probably. finding email from support-list on XFree86
Dec 20 11:29:35 <mgalgoci>	heh
Dec 20 12:05:34 <puiterwijk>	jkimbrou: hey, if I want to create a new volume on the netapp, should I specify an agreegate, or just let it select that? It would seem that we have some volumes on different aggregates, so figured I probably should ask
