Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Hello All:
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Just wanted to let you know that after 26 years Brian and I have decided to retire.
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	We are closing Hannah’s at the close of business today, Fri July 29th.
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Wanted to thank all of you for being such loyal customers over the past years
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	The corporation will continue until we wrap up all of our affairs, but
Jul 29 14:32:29 <lisac>	the restaurant and catering will stop today.
Jul 29 14:32:31 <lisac>	We want to wish you all the best in the years to come.
Jul 29 14:32:33 <lisac>	Regards
Jul 29 14:32:35 <lisac>	Ray &  Brian
Jul 29 14:33:49 *	patrickm shall miss their soup 
Jul 29 14:42:47 <patrickm>	lisac: this could be like Seinfeld's Soup Nazi episode where they are giving away soup in any container you bring in... very tempting
Jul 29 14:45:19 <lisac>	only till the end of today..
Jul 29 14:47:53 <patrickm>	lisac: although, nothing topped Mr Chan's wonton soup
Jul 29 14:48:40 <lisac>	patrickm, very true...i think we are showing our age now:-)
Jul 29 14:54:06 <patrickm>	lisac: yeah, i should install astroturf outside my office so i can yell at the interns to "get off my lawn"

Aug 03 10:05:51 <jooho>	lisac: GM I have a question about flight ticket 
Aug 03 10:06:04 <lisac>	sure
Aug 03 10:06:54 <jooho>	last Friday my flight was canceled and I got refund it. how to apply it to expense?
Aug 03 10:07:35 <lisac>	Have you already been reimbursed for the amount?
Aug 03 10:07:42 <jooho>	not yet
Aug 03 10:07:53 <lisac>	have you submitted the expense?
Aug 03 10:08:54 <jooho>	not yet.. I am trying but need to know ...how to apply it... itemize?
Aug 03 10:09:22 <lisac>	is it on a bank of america card or your personal card?
Aug 03 10:11:15 <jooho>	boa
Aug 03 10:12:11 <lisac>	so then both the expense and the reimbursement should show up in your expense statement.
Aug 03 10:12:30 <jooho>	right
Aug 03 10:12:52 <lisac>	I will confirm with Jeanine but I think you just have to state that the flight was cancelled and reimbursed
Aug 03 10:13:50 <jooho>	should i apply both statement?
Aug 03 10:14:30 <lisac>	I am going to send your question into the help page...will let you know when I hear back

Aug 08 11:37:14 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey
Aug 08 11:37:33 <strykerawb>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-21744
Aug 08 11:37:40 <strykerawb>	we have no idea what to dooooOooOooo
Aug 08 11:38:54 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to pwouters
Aug 08 11:39:53 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   basically we have no API to modify a connection once it's created?
Aug 08 11:41:15 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i believe there should be a way now.. at least we ran into a similar issue when cdk restart meant different certificate so it needed to be reloaded.
Aug 08 11:41:51 <strykerawb>	how did you fix your issue?  is this something i'll need to fix in my code?  or does your code automatically apply?
Aug 08 11:43:03 <strykerawb>	DockerCOnnection doesn't have a setTCPCertPath
Aug 08 11:43:37 <strykerawb>	has a getter but no setter
Aug 08 11:48:24 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: apparently there is a DockerConnectionManager.updateConnection(..) used from EditDockerConnection (wizard)

Aug 11 16:29:07 <yselkowitz>	anyone had issues bringing encrypted phones and/or laptops across the usa/can border?
Aug 11 16:31:01 <sergiodj>	I just crossed the border twice (round-trip), but I did not have any issues
Aug 11 16:40:43 <fche>	yeah but you're not on the watchlist
Aug 11 16:41:16 <fche>	yaakov, both sets of border police can in principle search through your stuff, and not let you cross if you don't cooperate
Aug 11 16:41:26 <sergiodj>	is yselkowitz on the watchlist?
Aug 11 16:41:32 <fche>	shouldn't he be?
Aug 11 16:41:41 <sergiodj>	I don't know, I'm just asking.
Aug 11 16:41:57 <yselkowitz>	I sure hope not
Aug 11 16:41:59 <sergiodj>	or is it something everybody should know?
Aug 11 16:42:11 <fche>	did you not hear about the unfortunate pretzel incident?
Aug 11 16:42:21 <yselkowitz>	I'm talking about my company laptop, which by policy must be encrypted
Aug 11 16:42:26 <yselkowitz>	pretzel incident?
Aug 11 16:43:27 <fche>	or that time, on the danube, with a butler, in the library, with a lead pipe?
Aug 11 16:45:10 <sergiodj>	obvious, right?
Aug 11 16:58:10 <rgrunber>	fbricon: i miss working on that.
Aug 11 17:03:32 <fbricon>	rgrunber: how is DockerConnectionManager detecting I have a running docker daemon?
Aug 11 17:04:58 <rgrunber>	fbricon: assuming you're running a nightly, there is new functionality to automatically look for some standard locations (eg unix://var/run/docker.sock, 127.0.0.1:2375, anything in environment variables like DOCKER_HOST, ...)
Aug 11 17:05:21 <rgrunber>	.. and add them as connections as opposed to just autofill them ..
Aug 11 17:06:18 <rgrunber>	there's also now an extension point so one could write separate plugins that contribute connection settings.. docker.core will discover them and automatically add them.
Aug 11 17:11:08 <fbricon>	rgrunber: thanks, that explains why my CLI build sees an extra connection, compared to my eclipse-run tests. The former uses a more recent docker tools build

Aug 16 10:52:04 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  hi roland :D
Aug 16 10:52:11 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey
Aug 16 10:52:28 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   im sure xavier will ping you shortly
Aug 16 10:52:29 <strykerawb>	but https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-23011 
Aug 16 10:53:00 <strykerawb>	they want this fixed yesterday ;)   
Aug 16 10:53:24 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: there's a fix for it in the upstream bug on review.. i could push it..
Aug 16 10:56:17 <strykerawb>	if im not annoying you, why is a return of object[]{null} possible?  where is that?
Aug 16 10:57:16 <strykerawb>	"a return of a list with a single null entry is possible."
Aug 16 10:58:16 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: it's not intended, but on windows, the script that checks for some environment variables returns 0 even if it fails.
Aug 16 10:58:51 <strykerawb>	where's that code?
Aug 16 10:59:02 <strykerawb>	i vaguely remember such weird environment variable loading script
Aug 16 10:59:14 <rgrunber>	script.bat is the resource.
Aug 16 11:00:13 <rgrunber>	i mean i should be clear, i haven't confirmed it, but it's the only way to get the behaviour observed. and it makes sense because the other providers do the right thing afaict.
Aug 16 11:01:14 <strykerawb>	[rob@rawbdor resources] (master)$ cat script.bat 
Aug 16 11:01:14 <strykerawb>	@echo off
Aug 16 11:01:14 <strykerawb>	SET DOCKER
Aug 16 11:01:19 <strykerawb>	thats the whole script?
Aug 16 11:02:15 <rgrunber>	yeah that's whats run..
Aug 16 11:03:41 <strykerawb>	wtf does that even do? 
Aug 16 11:04:29 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i figure it prints all env variables containing 'DOCKER' as a term.
Aug 16 11:05:05 <rgrunber>	http://ss64.com/nt/set.html
Aug 16 11:05:14 <rgrunber>	'The SET command invoked with a string (and no equal sign) will display a wildcard list of all matching variables'
Aug 16 11:05:54 <strykerawb>	ok so is the issue that the return value of the process is 0 (ie success) even if no such env vars are found?
Aug 16 11:06:30 <strykerawb>	i wouldn't consider that a bug at all... and whatever code you have that runs this batch script and loads it into a list should account for the fact that it may still provide an empty list
Aug 16 11:06:39 <strykerawb>	where's the code that runs the script?
Aug 16 11:07:12 <rgrunber>	ShellConnectionSettingsProvider
Aug 16 11:07:57 <rgrunber>	i have a fix i'll be pushing in + kicking a build, just need to modify how values are returned.
Aug 16 11:09:10 <strykerawb>	i mean xavier's comments are true.  This method just shouldn't be able to return a list with a null value
Aug 16 11:09:11 <strykerawb>					IDockerConnectionSettings setting = createDockerConnectionSettings(dockerSettings);
Aug 16 11:09:11 <strykerawb>					return Arrays.asList(new IDockerConnectionSettings [] { setting });
Aug 16 11:09:17 <strykerawb>	just check if setting is null first?
Aug 16 11:09:52 <strykerawb>	o
Aug 16 11:09:54 <strykerawb>	your patch does that
Aug 16 11:09:55 <strykerawb>	.........
Aug 16 11:10:09 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: yeah empty list would have solved this.. he wants to also return an empty list..
Aug 16 11:10:33 <rgrunber>	ideally i would have just pushed the smallest change that fixes it, but i don't mind also changing the returns to be proper.
Aug 16 11:10:43 <strykerawb>	eh, null vs empty list, your choice.  the question is who's using that api
Aug 16 11:10:59 <strykerawb>	if the caller is expecting a null or a list with 1 element,   then empty list might cause arrayindex shit 
Aug 16 11:11:12 <strykerawb>	or list index
Aug 16 11:11:14 <strykerawb>	whatever it is
Aug 16 11:11:32 <strykerawb>	so i'd advise you do a call heirarchy and see what the assumptions are here
Aug 16 11:12:04 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i can make all my providers return an empty list.. i really think it should be ok.. but i still need to check nulls because someone could just dump a plugin that uses that extension point and returns null.
Aug 16 11:12:36 <strykerawb>	yep
Aug 16 11:12:43 <strykerawb>	ok seems you've got this under control
Aug 16 11:13:59 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: yeah, for now.. just an fyi i've been swamped with eclipse upstream related work so i've not had much time lately to work on the docker tooling.
Aug 16 11:14:23 <rgrunber>	i guess i mean non-docker upstream work :P
Aug 16 11:14:30 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  what stuff you working on now?   
Aug 16 11:15:05 <rgrunber>	Eclipse Orbit.. moving it over to git and ebr (new way of contributing 3rd party libraries)
Aug 16 11:15:36 <strykerawb>	that sounds like pure work :|

Aug 29 11:15:39 <mbenitez>	#toronto free t-shirts and openshift books across from Lisa's office
Aug 29 11:16:00 <jkang>	nice, thanks!
Aug 29 12:11:18 <fche>	mbenitez, are those openshift books on topic for devtools peeps?
Aug 29 12:12:31 <mbenitez>	what I've seen is an introduction to OpenShift 3, how to install it, configure, get your first apps running
Aug 29 14:17:45 <rgb>	is that the free T-shirts from linuxcon?  the monster ones?
Aug 29 14:18:03 *	rgb only saw XL and larger and declined...
Aug 29 14:19:12 <mbenitez>	yes, the ones from linuxcon
Aug 30 10:31:23 <patrickm>	cookies in the kitchen from Honolulu Cookie Company... the chocolate dipped lilikoi is the best  [http://www.honolulucookie.com/] 
Aug 30 10:34:50 <jkang>	thanks!
Aug 30 11:43:08 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  hi roland :D
Aug 30 11:43:20 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey, any luck ?
Aug 30 11:43:26 <strykerawb>	nope!  :D
Aug 30 11:43:41 <strykerawb>	i mean i got it to work in principle but it still doesn't work ;) 
Aug 30 11:44:06 <strykerawb>	the problem is that most vagrant commands i issue this way end up saying that vagrant is trying to talk to the process as if it was a TTY terminal
Aug 30 11:44:23 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i had some suggestions a little while ago for that.
Aug 30 11:44:39 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i didn't have a chance to try them out..
Aug 30 11:44:59 <rgrunber>	(see the jira)
Aug 30 11:45:39 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   yeah...  we're only using machine-readbale during vagrant service-manager env  calls
Aug 30 11:45:43 <strykerawb>	so thats not relevant 
Aug 30 11:45:59 <strykerawb>	and as for wrapping in a call to bash,  um... this stuff needs to work in windows too
Aug 30 11:46:05 <strykerawb>	so we can't really wrap it in bash 
Aug 30 11:47:34 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   is there an official vagrant syntax to avoid the vagrant commands trying to treat the caller as a tty terminal?
Aug 30 11:47:36 <rgrunber>	can you wrap it in bash for just linux ?.. i could have sworn the vagrant code said something like "if not on windows and stdin.tty is false then error"
Aug 30 11:47:38 <strykerawb>	or is it on a per-command basis? 
Aug 30 11:51:22 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i don't think its possible. vagrant expects the stdin stream to be from a tty when not on windows.
Aug 30 11:51:50 <strykerawb>	that seems absolutely horrible as an assumption
Aug 30 11:51:55 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey so.. can you just try running this on windows and see if it works.. i mean.. it seems like it should.
Aug 30 11:52:17 <rgrunber>	'# We can't ask questions when the output isn't a TTY.'
Aug 30 11:52:27 <strykerawb>	where's that from? link?
Aug 30 11:52:35 <rgrunber>	ah one sec.. vagrant sources
Aug 30 11:53:08 <rgrunber>	https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/lib/vagrant/ui.rb#L161
Aug 30 11:54:48 <strykerawb>	see the thing that gets me is the wording in the error itself
Aug 30 11:54:58 <strykerawb>	Most actions in Vagrant that require a TTY have configuration
Aug 30 11:54:58 <strykerawb>	switches to disable this requirement. Please do that or run Vagrant
Aug 30 11:54:58 <strykerawb>	with TTY.
Aug 30 11:55:23 <strykerawb>	so this begs the question:  is there a way to ask questions without tty and its up to the plugins (ie vagrant service-manager) to implement properly a flag?
Aug 30 11:55:35 <strykerawb>	sorry i mean vagrant registration
Aug 30 11:57:27 <strykerawb>	rgrunber, the reason i ask this question is because,  running a simple java program that reads standard in / standard out doesn't require a TTY terminal
Aug 30 11:57:27 <rgrunber>	do they mean that there are configuration switches to answer the 'question' .. rather than.. there's a way to get the questions without TTY requirement.. i mean this is supposed to be a string message geared towards a user.. not a developer who cares about the internals.
Aug 30 11:57:43 <strykerawb>	so i can't see any technical reason they can't ask questions without a tty
Aug 30 11:57:45 <strykerawb>	it makes no sense
Aug 30 11:59:57 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  who do you think we can ask? =P 
Aug 30 12:00:01 <rgrunber>	maybe they send terminal codes through.. and try to confirm the stream is attached to something that could read them.. seems like it's not their problem but meh.
Aug 30 12:00:55 <rgrunber>	you might get a better answer on devtools (hopefully).. if not i'd love to play around with it because i think this is the right approach.. also you're so close.
Aug 30 12:00:57 <strykerawb>	now again, if i simply open a terminal view, connect to the local host, and send to the terminal's stream "vagrant up" it will work
Aug 30 12:01:08 <strykerawb>	bc then it IS a tty terminal
Aug 30 12:01:17 <strykerawb>	but then i can't get a reference to the IProcess
Aug 30 12:01:35 <strykerawb>	or even a java.lang.Process
Aug 30 12:01:42 <rgrunber>	a stream from bash -i should also be a tty though.. if i could get that to work.
Aug 30 12:02:29 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  do you have time to do some pair coding today or tomorrow? not sure on your current work load
Aug 30 12:02:44 <strykerawb>	i suspect the current impl "just works" in windows already
Aug 30 12:02:49 <strykerawb>	when run as admin
Aug 30 12:03:01 <strykerawb>	but to get it to work on both windows and linux is the hard part
Aug 30 12:04:41 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: so weird for me to be like 'yay it works on windows, that's .. actually the really important case' :(
Aug 30 12:05:28 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i'll be in tomorrow. tbh i just wanna tinker with wrapping the call in bash.. that should let isatty() pass.

Sep 01 12:00:00 <patrickm>	i have 4 of the "Code is My Spirit Animal" tshirts left... size men's large... if you want one [even if you have one already] they'll be on the cabinet in my office
Sep 01 12:02:22 <patrickm>	stooke: do you take a mens large?
Sep 01 12:17:13 <rgb>	patrickm: nice SRED numbers!
Sep 01 12:21:06 <patrickm>	rgb: indeed.  it's a relatively small effort [spread over many engineers] that really makes a bottom line difference
Sep 01 14:03:42 <rgb>	patrickm: what's the average percentage of salary saved?
Sep 01 14:04:03 <rgb>	I'm guessing somewhere between 10% and 30%?
Sep 01 14:25:39 <patrickm>	rgb: yes, in that range... total compensation as well, just not straight salary
Sep 01 14:26:37 *	patrickm doesn't see the formulation... i just received the final numbers [federal and provincial]
Sep 01 14:47:43 <patrickm>	lisac: is that cake for any special reason or is it a consume at will?
Sep 01 14:53:15 <rgrunber>	it's probably a social experiement in how long an unopened cake can remain that way in our office.
Sep 01 15:00:54 <patrickm>	rgrunber: i opened them
Sep 01 15:04:44 <steveg>	it's a good policy
Sep 01 15:04:47 <steveg>	when in doubt cake
Sep 01 15:05:10 <patrickm>	steveg: my policy is simpler... "cake"
Sep 01 15:06:16 <rgrunber>	ACCEPT *
Sep 02 10:52:39 <rgrunber>	PSA: careful when using the sink in the kitchen. that little rod that acts as the handle seems to have come off (again?)
Sep 02 10:53:16 <lisac>	Plan on buying a new tap next week...that should solve the problem:-)
Sep 02 10:53:49 <steveg>	i for one welcome our new tap overlord
Sep 02 10:54:42 <rgrunber>	steveg: i guess you could even say we are ruled by some.. number of taps greater than 1.. a grouping of taps.. a ... tapset.
Sep 02 10:55:15 <rgrunber>	.. SystemTap!!
Sep 02 10:55:40 <lisac>	we will have to rename the sink
Sep 02 10:56:17 <rgrunber>	Red Hat SystemTap Online
Sep 02 10:56:30 <rgrunber>	Enterprise Edition
Sep 02 10:56:34 <fche>	with containers
Sep 02 10:56:41 <fche>	that open
Sep 02 10:56:42 <rgrunber>	v3
Sep 02 10:56:43 <fche>	or may shift
Sep 02 10:56:49 <steveg>	not in the sink, containers go in the dishwasher
Sep 02 10:56:56 <fche>	or may the wrath of matt be upon you

Sep 07 14:31:38 <mbenitez>	lisac, thanks for the msg
Sep 07 14:38:27 <dbhole>	lisac: thanks for the heads up, got a text as well
Sep 07 17:49:44 <patrickm>	sweet, sweet hydro
Sep 07 17:50:09 <omajid_away>	glad to hear you have power now :)
Sep 07 17:51:49 <patrickm>	yeah, outage in etobicoke... 5000+ customers hit
Sep 07 17:51:59 <patrickm>	good times on a hot day ;)
Sep 07 17:52:23 <omajid_away>	yikes...
Sep 09 09:25:50 <cdrage>	omg, there's dozens of us! i just joined this channel
Sep 09 09:25:52 <cdrage>	what up from waterloo
Sep 09 09:26:31 <jkang>	morning :)
Sep 09 09:26:42 <dcheung>	you discovered our super secret channel
Sep 09 09:26:46 <yzhang>	Greetings fellow Canadian
Sep 09 09:26:49 <yzhang>	minus dcheung 
Sep 09 09:27:00 <dcheung>	yzhang--
Sep 09 09:27:06 <yzhang>	dcheung++
Sep 09 09:27:07 <cdrage>	hahahah, i just found it while trying to setup kerberos, saw a comment about #toronto channel
Sep 09 09:27:30 <steveg>	this is how it ends isnt it
Sep 09 09:31:47 <patrickm>	steveg: i haven't been down to westford in a month or two... are you still down there constantly?
Sep 09 09:32:15 <steveg>	not in a while
Sep 09 09:32:20 <steveg>	im going to brno on sunday
Sep 09 09:32:26 <steveg>	and was in sweden last week
Sep 09 09:32:27 <steveg>	lol
Sep 09 09:32:32 <steveg>	patrickm, ^^
Sep 09 09:32:51 <patrickm>	steveg: niiiiice
Sep 09 09:33:02 <steveg>	i probably havent been in westford since some time in june or july, but that was like 3 weeks in a row
Sep 09 09:33:13 *	patrickm goes over to steveg's desk to steal his stapler 
Sep 09 09:33:33 <steveg>	gotta work out how to put ye old openstack thingy in them container-roos
Sep 09 09:34:04 <steveg>	i dont have a stapler but you can definitely steal my books :P
Sep 09 09:34:34 <patrickm>	steveg: pffffft... openstack, that's for hipsters!  but that would explain your fondness for skinny jeans and old timey moustaches 
Sep 09 09:36:08 <patrickm>	steveg: but on a more serious side, there is an OpenStack Day in Montreal [November 22]... are you heading to that?
Sep 09 09:36:46 <patrickm>	i was thinking about taking a road trip for that
Sep 09 09:39:10 <steveg>	patrickm, unclear atm
Sep 09 09:39:21 <steveg>	patrickm, i havent specifically put my hand up but probably will
Sep 09 09:40:20 <patrickm>	steveg: fair enough, let me know
Sep 09 11:28:28 *	rgb wonders if steveg also has a fixie...
Sep 09 12:22:25 *	alanm wonders if rgb wants to add more wheels to said fixie 
Sep 09 12:38:14 *	rgb wants an original fixie, aka a 60" penny-farthing.
Sep 09 13:49:22 *	alanm wonders about attempting a track stand on a penny-farthing... it's a loonnggg way down to the ground.
Sep 09 14:21:02 *	rgb has ridden a penny-farthing several times and quite enjoyed the sensation, but has otherwise no interest in owning a matching-wheel chain-driven fixie...
Sep 09 14:24:35 *	alanm has never wanted a fixie. I'd rather get a cyclo-cross bike that I can take up to the cottage with me and use it as a rain bike when I'm in town
Sep 09 15:05:24 <strykerawb>	rgrunber, please kill me
Sep 09 15:05:27 <strykerawb>	i'll provide the weapon
Sep 09 15:05:34 <strykerawb>	i'll instruct my family to dispose of the weapon afterwards too
Sep 09 15:38:35 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: whatsup?
Sep 09 15:38:54 <strykerawb>	so was testing my QE's complaints of our nice terminal solution on windows
Sep 09 15:39:09 *	alanm suggests that a barrel of napalm(TM) works well
Sep 09 15:39:11 <strykerawb>	first problem was easy to solve:  he said when he typed intput it didnt show.  easy fix, boolean somewhere. 
Sep 09 15:39:19 <strykerawb>	however.........
Sep 09 15:39:29 <strykerawb>	vagrant's output is something like this
Sep 09 15:39:41 <strykerawb>	Do you want to register the CDK? [y/n]:   {you type here}
Sep 09 15:39:47 <strykerawb>	so i type y,  enter.  and wait
Sep 09 15:39:54 <strykerawb>	nothing.   i press enter again.  then it says
Sep 09 15:39:56 <strykerawb>	"Username:  "
Sep 09 15:40:06 <strykerawb>	i type "rst" and it cuts me off, somehow recognizing my 2nd enter 
Sep 09 15:40:09 <strykerawb>	and says "Password:  " 
Sep 09 15:40:29 <strykerawb>	i type a password, press enter,  nothing.   Press enter a 2nd time,  craps out again in similar fashion
Sep 09 15:41:01 <strykerawb>	so then i thought well this is really weird, so instead of running "vagrant up" i had it run "java SimpleIO"  (some shtity main class i made that does i/o... asks questions, you type response, etc)
Sep 09 15:41:04 <strykerawb>	worked 100% as expected
Sep 09 15:41:07 <strykerawb>	fails 100% with vagrant
Sep 09 15:41:09 <strykerawb>	kill me
Sep 09 15:41:11 <strykerawb>	with fire
Sep 09 15:41:14 <strykerawb>	napalm even 
Sep 09 15:41:23 <strykerawb>	buy it from alanm .... he sounds like the kinda guy with a stockpile
Sep 09 15:41:38 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: so the bug is with vagrant, and specifically on windows ?
Sep 09 15:42:05 <strykerawb>	i would assume thats the situation. i mean i haven't tested 30 or 40 scenarios or anything
Sep 09 15:42:19 <strykerawb>	im not sure what other windows commands ask for user input
Sep 09 15:42:26 <strykerawb>	so i can test in other frames
Sep 09 15:43:19 <alanm>	it's only a suggestion ... I was going to suggest ammonium nitrate (fertilizer) and some dynamite but there are laws about that sort of thing.
Sep 09 15:43:42 <strykerawb>	depends on the country
Sep 09 15:43:43 <rgrunber>	alanm: Rob doesn't get hung up on these 'laws' you speak of.
Sep 09 15:44:17 <rgrunber>	i think you'd probably know more if you could see the raw stream in the linux case, and the windows case..
Sep 09 15:44:17 <strykerawb>	if you're about to kill yourself, what right do mortal men have to stop me from doing it in a blaze of glory?
Sep 09 15:45:01 <stooke>	strykerawb i know nothing  of what you're trying to solve with vagrant, is it a Java util, and could it be using the jline library to do console input?
Sep 09 15:45:24 <dcheung>	also there's aesh
Sep 09 15:45:34 <dcheung>	but vagrant is for vm setup
Sep 09 15:45:36 <strykerawb>	vagrant itself is a VM-runner basically.   runs virtualbox or others... has plugins, etc.   
Sep 09 15:45:47 <strykerawb>	all in ruby i believe
Sep 09 15:48:15 <jkang>	supposedly targeted at consistent dev environments for a team to reduce cases of "works on my machine"
Sep 09 15:49:03 <rgrunber>	jkang: you're supposedly lacks any element of sarcasm.
Sep 09 15:49:06 <rgrunber>	your*
Sep 09 15:49:30 <alanm>	how about a one way shipping box to Redmond ? 
Sep 09 15:49:56 <jkang>	oh yes no sarcasm at all :D though I admit it's a nice concept
Sep 09 15:50:22 <jkang>	and "works on my machine but not yours" does happen more than enough to be annoying
Sep 09 15:50:40 <alanm>	haha
Sep 09 15:50:40 <strykerawb>	utopia is also a nice concept
Sep 09 15:50:53 <alanm>	so what else is new ?
Sep 09 15:51:12 <strykerawb>	this is obama's fault
Sep 09 15:51:14 <strykerawb>	thanks obama
Sep 09 15:51:17 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i still think the answer is in the vagrant code somewhere.. and in seeing the raw stream.. might bring some clues.
Sep 09 15:51:24 <strykerawb>	(sorry, im muhrikan, interoping in your socialist paradise)
Sep 09 15:51:29 *	alanm will leave you young'uns to figure things out.
Sep 09 15:51:33 <strykerawb>	interloping
Sep 09 15:59:52 <patrickm>	fche: which engineer is planning on giving the FSOSS talk?
Sep 09 16:00:12 <fche>	I gather csanting mainly
Sep 09 16:00:36 <fche>	may his soul survive unscathed
Sep 09 16:01:36 <patrickm>	godspeed csanting
Sep 09 16:04:32 <fche>	we might want to pre-reserve a cemetery plot, just in case
Sep 09 16:05:06 <alanm>	what ? no exorcisms or burning at the stake ? That's no fun
Sep 09 16:07:43 <rgb>	if you are talking about burning, an urn takes a lot less space than a coffin...
Sep 09 16:08:05 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: fwiw if i find some spare cycles i wouldn't mind having a look.. although step 1 would literally be get my hands on a windows box..
Sep 09 16:08:33 <strykerawb>	and then getting vagrant... and cdk... and lots of other stuff up ;) 
Sep 09 16:08:38 <fche>	rgrunber is trying out for defenestration
Sep 09 16:08:50 <strykerawb>	CDK:  Coder Defenestration Kit
Sep 09 16:08:58 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hah.. don't wanna think about it..
Sep 09 16:09:21 <strykerawb>	the europeans all know that word... apparently there was a war called the defenestration war or something
Sep 09 16:09:36 <strykerawb>	The Defenestrations of Prague
Sep 09 16:10:46 <alanm>	lol
Sep 09 16:13:03 <rgrunber>	i've heard it's a great city.. should definitely add it on my list to .. czech it out.
Sep 09 16:17:13 <strykerawb>	i hear its a great place to defenestrate people and things
Sep 09 16:32:38 <alanm>	just remember to keep that surplus T-72 tank in the barn where it belongs
Sep 09 16:43:57 *	rgb plans to visit prague after devconf.cz with luiz.
Sep 09 16:45:49 *	rgb being francophone loves the word defenestration
Sep 09 16:55:28 *	rgb discovers there was more than one defenestration in prague!

Sep 12 15:53:14 *	patrickm was just looking at the Red Hat Course selection.... RHCSA offered in Toronto Oct 31-Nov 04 and Jan 30-Feb 03
Sep 12 15:53:46 <patrickm>	and they are close by... 40 Eglinton Ave East
Sep 12 15:54:38 <patrickm>	[interns are allowed as well]
Sep 13 03:26:11 <steveg>	patrickm, i actually think they have a kiosk at exit certified now as well so if people just want to do the exam that is an option too
Sep 13 07:44:35 <patrickm>	steveg: good to know, thanks
Sep 13 12:05:44 <patrickm>	dbhole, lberk, thauser|gym: did you guys get the  Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)  blast from UofT? 
Sep 13 12:06:46 <dbhole>	patrickm: yeah, got one a few min ago
Sep 13 12:07:21 <patrickm>	dbhole: ok, as long as one of you guys got it
Sep 13 12:23:51 <lberk>	patrickm: any change in our end of things in regards to recruiting from that program? (iirc the 15K stipend from the program itself helps)
Sep 13 12:25:16 <patrickm>	lberk: that's for you to decide... part of the internship co-ordination is investigating new opportunities  
Sep 13 12:26:13 <lberk>	will do
Sep 13 13:51:41 <patrickm>	lisac: is there a specific one for Canada?  This one, while claiming to be for North America, seems to be US centric -> https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1032763

Sep 14 12:28:30 <strykerawb>	rgrunber, whatcha doin today? ;) 
Sep 14 12:29:35 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: not sure if i'll have time to look into it.. we'll see.. it's on my list.
Sep 14 12:30:33 <rgrunber>	i did set up a windows box with vagrant+virtualbox so should be ready once we download devstudio + your plugin.
Sep 14 13:45:39 <chrisphi_>	FYI: Down the street (140 Eglinton Ave, where Filthy McNasty's was?) is now a branch of  "La Carnitas" which has good taco's etc . I regularly eat  at the one at 501 College and recommend it (of course they have good beers too... 8-)
Sep 14 13:46:13 <lisac>	chrisphi_, and ice cream next door....
Sep 14 13:46:23 <chrisphi_>	{thats 140 Eglinton Ave East....}
Sep 14 13:46:29 <chrisphi_>	:-)
Sep 14 13:49:20 <dbhole>	chrisphi_: no takeout though :(
Sep 14 13:50:35 <chrisphi_>	dbhole: Hmm maybe they will figure that out if enough people suggest it ;-)
Sep 14 13:50:41 <dbhole>	:)
Sep 14 13:53:15 <dcheung>	I think lisac mises the icecream
Sep 14 13:53:19 <dcheung>	misses
Sep 14 15:19:13 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  ping
Sep 14 15:19:21 <strykerawb>	found out CDT has a "Spawner" class which extends Process 
Sep 14 15:19:27 <rgrunber>	hey
Sep 14 15:19:28 <strykerawb>	launches commands through a PTY
Sep 14 15:19:38 <strykerawb>	pty = pseudo-tty
Sep 14 15:19:48 <strykerawb>	i'll try that solution i guess 
Sep 14 15:19:52 <strykerawb>	but it adds a dep on us to CDT
Sep 14 15:19:56 <strykerawb>	worst case i can copy the class i guess
Sep 14 15:20:16 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hmm so using that instead of runtime.getruntime() you mean ?
Sep 14 15:20:23 <strykerawb>	yes
Sep 14 15:20:30 <rgrunber>	worth a shot.. 
Sep 14 15:20:57 <rgrunber>	assuming the problem is is vagrant being unable to detect certain things from java-side.
Sep 14 15:22:35 <strykerawb>	the problem is vagrant just thinks its talking to a tty
Sep 14 15:22:40 <strykerawb>	vagrant really should fix their side
Sep 14 15:22:47 <strykerawb>	there's no reason they need to treat it as a pty/tty
Sep 14 15:22:50 <rgrunber>	and it moves the point of failure to cdt's win32 x86_64 code.
Sep 14 15:22:52 <rgrunber>	:P..
Sep 14 15:35:40 <patrickm>	dcheung: are you suggesting ice cream tomorrow?
Sep 14 15:36:24 <lisac>	patrickm, great....your turn to make it:-)
Sep 14 15:37:16 <patrickm>	lisac: i'll give it a go... as long as i don't have to clean up ;)
Sep 14 15:37:48 *	patrickm can be more "experimental and creative" that way
Sep 14 15:38:07 <lisac>	patrickm, oh NO....that is all part of it:-)
Sep 14 15:38:45 <patrickm>	lisac: then, alas, I must decline due to your restrictions on my creative freedom
Sep 14 15:39:58 <lisac>	patrickm, i did not restrict that....
Sep 14 15:45:33 *	patrickm will just bring in $10 for Sweet Jesus instead
Sep 14 20:58:16 *	rgb would make ice cream if he were around to do it...

Sep 22 10:52:49 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: https://post-office.corp.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo :P
Sep 22 10:54:42 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, there are 4611 lists out there.
Sep 22 10:54:59 <rgrunber>	https://post-office.corp.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/brno-ddr-list
Sep 22 10:56:09 <rgrunber>	i honestly never gave too much of a thought about memo-list having tech-list topics until that thread.. and then said yeah..
Sep 22 16:10:19 <patrickm>	just got a call from the Mothership [Raleigh], apparently the round phone in the video conference room on the Sales side is unplugged.  
Sep 22 16:11:11 <patrickm>	i just got home to beat the traffic, if there is someone in the office that could wander over and plug it in, Raleigh would appreciate it
Sep 22 16:11:19 <patrickm>	[and let me know]
Sep 22 16:13:17 <jwellman>	Someone is in there filming a presentation; I'll check in again in a little bit
Sep 22 16:13:43 <patrickm>	jwellman: thanks
Sep 22 16:14:13 <jwellman>	np
Sep 22 17:26:58 <patrickm>	jwellman: did you complete your task?
Sep 23 11:52:29 <fnasser>	Highlander, Hi Andrew, it is Friday, maybe it is time for us to educate us a bit on the tax implications of the ESPP participation?  :-)
Sep 23 11:53:13 <fnasser>	Highlander, When is the tax over that percentage taken?  Is that percentage taken after tax in the payroll?
Sep 23 13:11:01 <Highlander>	fnasser:  THe way this normnally works :  whatever the market price is when you get the shares minus whatever you paid for them is charged to you as a taxable benefit.
Sep 23 13:11:35 <Highlander>	so you'll pay your normal tax rate on that difference.     I havent seen any documentation on our plan, but Id be surprised if they did it any other way
Sep 23 13:12:54 <Highlander>	they may use different words for the benefit, but it's likely to be that way.
Sep 23 13:14:42 <Highlander>	Karen was in IBM's ESPP for a while and it boiled down to that, althogh they did some funny calculations every pay cheque that I never really understood so that you didnt get a bit tax hit twice a year on your paycheque when they were issued for the benefit.  
Sep 23 13:24:25 <rgb>	I know it isn't open until Monday, but has anyone got any idea what to put in username/password or SSN in "register now"?
Sep 23 13:36:21 <rgb>	sorry, under "outside US", "participant number"
Sep 23 13:49:15 <fnasser>	Highlander, That makes sense at the end, but how does it affect the tax in each pay date -- that amount, lets say 10% was stil earninsg, so subject to tax right?
Sep 23 13:50:08 <fnasser>	Highlander, So we pay tax on the money we "saved" on each paycheck, then pay a bit more on the profit we made by buying below marked when the stocks are bought every 6 months
Sep 23 13:50:48 <fnasser>	Highlander, In other words, the 10% wil come from your net pay each payroll
Sep 23 13:50:52 <Highlander>	that I don't know.     I expect you'll pay tax on "income" of 15% of your deduction amount since that is guaranteed.
Sep 23 13:51:18 <Highlander>	maybe they amortize the rest over the next 6 months or do it all at once at 6 month, although that woudl siurprise me.
Sep 23 13:51:32 <fnasser>	Like 10% of the gross is taken from the net 
Sep 23 13:51:56 <Highlander>	I never did figure IBMs out.. they may have been "guessing" based on the current stock price.  not sure. It was rarelty the sameamount
Sep 23 13:52:46 <fnasser>	Highlander, I guess there is only oe way to find out -- try it for 6 months
Sep 23 13:53:16 <fnasser>	Highlander, I wonder if with the taxes and all it is still worth of "saving" this way
Sep 23 13:53:40 <fnasser>	Highlander, The profits increase if the market goes up but then the stock funds will also go up
Sep 23 13:53:51 <Highlander>	they know you will get at least 15% of a benefit from your deducated amount, so they will likely tax you on at least that amount each cheque I would think
Sep 23 13:54:20 <fnasser>	Above the regular tax on salary income?
Sep 23 13:54:21 <Highlander>	its like RSUs.. you only see half of what the benefit is :-P
Sep 23 13:54:30 <fnasser>	That is where the money is comming from anyway
Sep 23 13:54:33 <Highlander>	it ought to be taxed like regular salary
Sep 23 13:55:30 <Highlander>	when you get a taxable benefit, that number is added to your salary for that paycheque, and the federal tax tables are used on that number for your deducation that cheque
Sep 23 13:55:37 <fnasser>	Highlander, We have to decide to take part and how much next week, and I am still not fully convinced it is worth doing it
Sep 23 13:55:45 <Highlander>	so its effectively taxing you like a salary increase :-P
Sep 23 13:56:05 <fnasser>	Highlander, Shouldn't it be capital gain?  Lower tax 
Sep 23 13:56:20 <Highlander>	well, in theory your after tax profit is guatranteed to be at least 7.5% of whatever you put in :-)
Sep 23 13:56:20 <fnasser>	Highlander, Well, at least any gains above the 15% is capital gain
Sep 23 13:56:50 <fnasser>	Highlander, So a savings account with a 6 month return of 7.5% ?
Sep 23 13:56:58 <fnasser>	after tax
Sep 23 13:57:01 <Highlander>	depends on whetehr they categorize it as a stock benefit. if they do, then you'll pay even less tax.. but IM not convinced.  gains on RSus are taxed at your salary rate
Sep 23 13:57:32 <Highlander>	I dont think capital gains will come into it until after you own the stock
Sep 23 13:57:53 <fnasser>	Highlander, but whatever I make when I sell the RSU stock I've got is taxed as capita gain (or los)
Sep 23 13:57:55 <fnasser>	loss
Sep 23 13:58:11 <Highlander>	yes. once you own it, its all capital gain/loss
Sep 23 13:58:37 <fnasser>	Highlander, Ah, that is true, so the percentage above 15% is still before I got the stocks
Sep 23 13:58:44 <fnasser>	in the case of the ESPP
Sep 23 13:58:45 <Highlander>	but they tax you on it before they issue it to you.. so its at salary rate.  I would expect the ESPP to be similar.. but we can hope not. 
Sep 23 13:59:23 <fnasser>	Nah, fat chance, you are right, we are buying it below marked price and that can be more than 15% if the stocks went up
Sep 23 13:59:34 <fnasser>	But... maybe there is a bit of law specifically for that case
Sep 23 13:59:44 <fnasser>	To incentive investing or something
Sep 23 13:59:58 <Highlander>	I suspect the tax law works such that if they did it any other way, the company is on the hook for the difference .  THis way, it all on us
Sep 23 14:00:33 <fnasser>	Highlander, Anyway, bottom line is that it is still a savings account on steroids given the currently interest paied around, right?
Sep 23 14:01:12 <Highlander>	indeed. Its basically some free money
Sep 23 14:01:23 <fnasser>	Highlander, Got it!
Sep 23 14:01:26 <Highlander>	unles you are incredibly unlucky and the stock price drops by more than 15% before you can sell it :-)
Sep 23 14:01:35 <Highlander>	so there is still a TINY risk.
Sep 23 14:02:26 <Highlander>	if we had a black monday on exactly the wrong day.    I'd guess we'd have more pressing concerns if that happened tho :-) 
Sep 23 14:02:56 <fnasser>	Highlander, Rigt, I even think it happened when we had it a long time ago, but I just hung to my shares for a bit and they came back up.
Sep 23 14:02:59 <fnasser>	Highlander,   Thanks again Andrew! 
Sep 23 14:04:15 <Highlander>	np.  Glad to make stuff up anytime!
Sep 23 14:05:35 <fnasser>	:-)
Sep 23 14:10:17 <patrickm>	fnasser, Highlander: https://mojo.redhat.com/servlet/JiveServlet/previewBody/1091225-102-1-1838864/Canada%20ESPP.pdf
Sep 23 14:10:27 <patrickm>	[specific to Canada]
Sep 23 14:11:47 <fnasser>	patrickm, Thanks, will read that
Sep 23 14:12:18 <patrickm>	it answers some of the questions your were asking, not that Highlander's direction was incorrect
Sep 23 14:12:40 <patrickm>	rgb: what's the issue?  do you not have an existing Fidelity account?
Sep 23 14:13:47 <Highlander>	it doesnt address when they will take the amount., If they charge you tax on the full amount for 6 months of discount on one chqeue, that could really hurt that cheque a lot.  
Sep 23 14:15:22 <Highlander>	and they imply thats when you get charged.. we shall see.
Sep 23 14:15:43 <Highlander>	unless they issue you less shares to cover the tax due... which I suppose is possible since thats what they do with RSUs
Sep 23 14:16:36 <Highlander>	and that mechanism is already in place.. so thats probably what they'll do...  its the path of least work for them :-)
Sep 23 15:16:01 <rgb>	patrickm: do I have a fidelity account?
Sep 23 15:18:57 <patrickm>	rgb: yeah, do you have an existing account.  on monday, you'll just log in using the Ixxxxxxx userid / password combo and sign up there
Sep 23 15:19:25 <patrickm>	<rgb> sorry, under "outside US", "participant number"
Sep 23 15:25:34 <rgb>	patrickm: where do I find that number?
Sep 23 15:26:13 <rgb>	is it called something else?
Sep 23 15:27:02 <rgb>	related to dpsp?
Sep 23 15:27:13 <patrickm>	rgb: no, that's sunlife
Sep 23 15:27:48 <patrickm>	rgb: do you receive snail mail notifications from fidelity?   
Sep 23 15:28:04 <patrickm>	if so, it's on there as Participant Number
Sep 23 15:32:09 <rgb>	that doesn't ring a bell.  the only snail mail I receive is sunlife, for several different plans.
Sep 23 15:34:14 <rgb>	why would I have a fidelity number?
Sep 23 15:34:37 <fche>	you haven't received any stock-oriented benefits ever?
Sep 23 15:35:03 <rgb>	never.  it wasn't offered at hire.  I asked about it, but it wasn't available.
Sep 23 15:35:56 <fche>	ok ... I'm sure your manager etc. can tweak the right knobs to get things set up for you if you want to participate in the new program
Sep 23 15:36:15 <fche>	I don't recall whether we could sign up for the fidelity system on our own initiative and associate it with the RH company 
Sep 23 15:36:22 <stooke>	Ther's a line in the "Important ESPP Enrollment Information" email: "You will receive a separate enrollment communication from Fidelity on or about September 26th"
Sep 23 15:36:29 <fche>	at worst, ping the hr helpdesk?
Sep 23 15:37:06 <stooke>	So perhaps we get the number on Monday?
Sep 23 15:37:23 <fche>	could be!
Sep 23 15:37:24 <patrickm>	rgb: so the answer to the question is "i don't have an account"... both fche and stooke have provided good direction
Sep 23 15:41:58 <rgb>	ok, so I may see something monday.  I wish that were in the FAQs.

Sep 29 09:44:09 <green>	If it's done in bulk just before purchasing the stock, do we have the option to pull out if there's a huge negative swing in the exchange rate?

Oct 18 13:43:15 <stooke>	The Loblaws needs more Asian ingredients: fish sauce, wonton noodles and dumpling wrappers were missing.

Oct 25 14:09:03 <thauser>	dberry, you're looking for which patch?
Oct 25 14:09:23 <thauser>	dbhole, ^ 
Oct 25 14:09:29 <thauser>	dberry, misping sorry. 
Oct 25 14:09:48 <dbhole>	thauser: Well I installed 6.4.0 GA from the jar installer (I want to install bpms ultimately). I then tried to update to 11, which says minimum requirement is update 9, so trying to get 9 now
Oct 25 14:10:04 <thauser>	dbhole, alright, use this (thanks for using the installer woop)

Oct 25 14:10:25 <dbhole>	thauser: ah, nice.. thanks!
Oct 25 14:10:40 <thauser>	dbhole, easier than chasing a brew build down 
Oct 25 14:11:41 <dbhole>	thauser: agreed.. much faster now, thanks again
Oct 25 14:17:38 <dcheung>	thauser: does the bpms installer ship with eap?
Oct 25 14:17:47 <thauser>	dcheung, the bpms one does not, no
Oct 25 14:19:48 <dbhole>	thauser: Is there a way to download the latest update standalone without going through the patching process?
Oct 25 14:19:57 <thauser>	dbhole, absolutely: 
Oct 25 14:20:06 <thauser>	dbhole, http://download-node-02.eng.bos.redhat.com/released/JBEAP-6/6.4.11/jboss-eap-6.4.11-full-build.zip
Oct 25 14:20:39 <thauser>	dbhole, unzip that and you're good to go
Oct 25 14:21:21 <dbhole>	thauser: how come it is much smaller than the individual patches? Patch 9 for example is 607MB
Oct 25 14:22:05 <thauser>	dbhole, i'm actually not too familiar with the patching process. i always grab the latest full zip. 
Oct 25 14:22:33 <thauser>	dbhole, patch for .11 is small. .9 must contain something fundamentally different. 
Oct 25 14:24:30 <dbhole>	thauser: nice, that seems to have worked well, thanks
Oct 25 14:24:50 <thauser>	dbhole, 600 megs for a patch..i'm wondering if there's not some kind of error going on here
Oct 25 14:25:02 <thauser>	dbhole, that's only slightly smaller than the entire build maven repo $.$
Oct 25 14:25:29 <dbhole>	thauser: wonder if it contains maven artifacts too.. though it seems like too much for a patch
Oct 25 14:26:57 <mrobson>	just joined, but are you talking about EAP 6.4 CPs being really big?
Oct 25 14:27:34 <thauser>	mrobson, yes; update 9 is 600M, while update 11 is 88M; wondering about that
Oct 25 14:28:14 <mrobson>	thauser: the is a layering issue with the CPs in that each CP contains all the layers from the previous CP so they grow very quickly 
Oct 25 14:28:37 <mrobson>	thauser: CP9 is now a mandatory CP, you can;t apply CP10 or CP11 without CP 9, it was done to reset the size 
Oct 25 14:28:44 <thauser>	mrobson, i understand now
Oct 25 14:28:45 <mrobson>	thauser: this is fixed in EAP 7
Oct 25 14:29:00 <thauser>	mrobson, so for EAP 6.4.9, it contains all patches from 1 -> 8 as well. got it
Oct 25 14:29:25 <dbhole>	that explains the size.. glad to hear it is fixed in 7
Oct 25 14:29:41 <mrobson>	thauser: yep, but the size is an issue of the layering and that has been addressed 
Oct 25 14:30:00 <mrobson>	thauser: CP10 / 11 are small right now.. like CP1 / 2 but they will get big again :)
Oct 25 14:30:35 <thauser>	mrobson, thanks :D
Oct 25 14:30:39 <mrobson>	thauser: np
Oct 25 14:46:41 <dberry>	thauser, NP.  sorry, was OTP
Oct 25 14:57:11 <dcheung>	patrickm: do you have any pic of the totoro one?

Oct 31 11:04:18 <patrickm>	fnasser: just finishing off the last 1/4 round of Poilâne... now the long wait until next Spring
Oct 31 11:08:15 <fche>	patrickm, why wait?
Oct 31 11:08:36 <fche>	btw, anyone here who went to FSOSS last week?  how did things go?
Oct 31 11:09:02 <fnasser>	patrickm, +1, or do they oly deliver in the Spring/Summer?
Oct 31 11:13:01 <yzhang>	fche, thing went pretty well
Oct 31 11:13:14 <ipun>	fche good turnout and some pretty good presentations overall
Oct 31 11:13:16 <yzhang>	notably all the speakers got cheeseboards
Oct 31 11:14:08 <fche>	("cheeseboard" -- my google is failing me -- surely they didn't get a berkeley pizza nor wood cutting boards!)
Oct 31 11:14:28 <fche>	thanks, sounds good though, looking forward to the videos
Oct 31 11:15:12 <yzhang>	"cheese cutting set" is probably how I should have phrased it
Oct 31 11:15:12 <ipun>	fche its like a charcuterie tool set, which was FSOSS branded
Oct 31 11:16:30 <fche>	aha.  interesting choice!
Oct 31 11:20:02 <patrickm>	fche: it's only special if you have it once a year... like Halloween
Oct 31 11:20:54 <patrickm>	fche: i agree with yzhang and ipun, FSOSS was good
Oct 31 11:22:14 <patrickm>	fche: the presentations from  ian/cody/josh/alex/jie/zack were well received 
Oct 31 11:23:30 <patrickm>	fnasser: if you're in to hard candy, my order from http://www.hammondscandies.com/ should be sitting on my desk
Oct 31 11:24:12 <patrickm>	fnasser: i did a trial order with some holiday candy to see how long it would take to get here
Oct 31 11:27:04 <fnasser>	patrickm, Candies have been removed from my diet by my personal dietitian :-(

Oct 31 11:29:25 <fnasser>	true
Oct 31 11:29:43 <patrickm>	dcheung: you'll like next week's order -> http://ohdanishbakery.com/  [specifically the pumpkin caramel kringle]
Oct 31 11:30:29 <patrickm>	dcheung: one of our first interns was from the University of Wisconsin... and he arrived with one of these
Oct 31 11:30:46 <dcheung>	did he immediately get a full-time offer afterwards?
Oct 31 11:32:49 <patrickm>	dcheung: unfortunately, no...  i don't know where Faisal ended up... it's was long ago in a place far, far away [2323 Yonge Street]
Oct 31 11:33:07 <patrickm>	it*
Oct 31 11:33:55 <patrickm>	fnasser: my order for Murchies is coming up as well -> http://www.murchies.com/store/ , if your dietitian will allow tea ;)
Oct 31 11:35:36 <fnasser>	patrickm, Wow!  Now we can find everything on the Internet!
Oct 31 13:49:28 <mwringe>	there is a chocolate tart in the kitchen from my practising over the weekend, please help yourself. The crust is a bit cracked because the recipes instructions for time was not enough and I put it in the oven to cook some more, but after I had removed the tart ring

Nov 04 10:07:48 <patrickm>	mwringe: how much of a time commitment are these courses?  there are several interesting ones listed
Nov 04 10:08:11 *	patrickm is still on the fence for welding courses
Nov 04 10:09:06 <fche>	that's one of the few things /me misses about toronto - technicalish college courses
Nov 04 10:09:16 <fche>	er, and you all of course

Nov 04 10:10:44 <fche>	:)
Nov 04 10:29:45 <mwringe>	patrickm: I can't take that one since I wont have the prerequisite for it until part way through December. The courses are usually 1 day a week for 4 hours, over a 6 to 12 week period depending on the course.
Nov 04 10:30:27 <mwringe>	patrickm: but, I may be taking the short version of that course: https://coned.georgebrown.ca/courses-and-certificates/festive-sweets/
Nov 04 11:14:51 <fnasser>	mwringe, Angela said that the GBC hospitality courses are top-notch
Nov 04 11:15:28 <fnasser>	mwringe, A few of her colleagues from Nutrition and Food at Ryerson also took some courses there
Nov 04 11:17:38 <mwringe>	fnasser: their culinary program is great (I have taken something like 13 courses already and have my culinary arts certificate). I am just starting to their baking program, which is unfortunately (at least so far) not as good as their culinary ones, but it might just be because its their beginning course 
Nov 04 11:18:30 <patrickm>	mwringe: well, if you have to I won't stop you ;)

Nov 07 11:22:01 <mwringe>	patrickm: awesome
Nov 07 11:23:27 <mwringe>	patrickm: I am finding the culinary side to be a lot better than the baking side, 9088 is fairly basic to get everyone started and the better courses are the ones you can take after that one

Nov 07 13:18:55 <mwringe>	there is a white chocolate raspberry cake in the kitchen, please help yourself. Its from my weekend practising, hopefully its good
Nov 07 13:19:13 <dcheung>	mwringe++ it looks amazing
Nov 07 13:29:59 <rgrunber>	mwringe: it's good.
Nov 07 13:30:56 <mwringe>	its not bad, there is a bunch of things I would probably do differently if I were to make it again
Nov 07 13:31:30 <dcheung>	to do differently: make 2 cakes instead of 1
Nov 08 11:49:33 <patrickm>	received an order this morning from Murchies in BC... half of a delicious Christmas cake is in the kitchen

Nov 08 11:50:00 *	patrickm is a nice guy... but not a "whole cake" nice guy 
Nov 08 12:04:19 <rgb>	oh lovely.  this was just announced today:  http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Rs-500-and-Rs-1000-notes-pulled-out-of-circulation-immediately-PM-Narendra-Modi/articleshow/55315473.cms
Nov 08 12:05:16 *	rgb is holding Rs16,000 in 1000 and 500 notes.  (50:1 Rs:$CDN)
Nov 08 12:05:46 <rgb>	so in 1.5h this wad is worth nothing.
Nov 08 12:07:06 <yzhang>	still tradable until end of december
Nov 08 12:07:28 <yzhang>	it seems
Nov 08 12:07:38 <rgrunber>	yeah.. just need to find a bank that takes them..
Nov 08 12:08:11 <rgrunber>	also is the article translated beacause there are quite a few typos.
Nov 08 12:26:10 <rgb>	and can only exchange Rs4000 per day...
Nov 08 12:26:19 <rgb>	http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/heres-what-you-can-do-with-rs500-and-rs100-notes/listshow/55316702.cms
Nov 08 12:26:29 <rgb>	since I don't have a local bank account
Nov 08 12:28:10 <rgb>	sorry, it just says up to Rs4000, so maybe that is per transaction...  doesn't have a time window specified.
Nov 08 12:29:20 <rgb>	yzhang: yeah, I was being dramatic...  I took out enough today to pay Rs12,000 for furniture today that turned out not to be ready yet, so I'm still holding that cash.
Nov 08 12:29:51 <yzhang>	That article does make it sound very sudden though
Nov 08 12:30:05 <yzhang>	I'm sure there are people who are receiving it very negatively
Nov 08 12:32:25 <rgb>	yes, undoubtedly, but so far, none of that negativity has appeared in the media...
Nov 08 12:33:14 <rgb>	Rs1000 is the largest note now.  middle class seems to deal mostly in Rs100 notes.

Nov 29 13:15:01 <stooke>	In Japan, staff that go on vacation were thought to be "letting down the team".  While that view is changing, the custom of "omiyage" (something brought back from the travels) remains.
Nov 29 13:15:49 <stooke>	In that spirit, I am about to put a box of small mochi (rice flour balls, usually with red bean paste inside) in the kitchen.
Nov 29 13:16:31 <rgrunber>	let the custom of free food in the kitchen continue for years to come.
Nov 29 13:21:47 <stooke>	It'll probably go rock hard by the end of the day, so please eat up!
Nov 29 13:29:42 <dcheung>	stooke++
Nov 29 13:54:38 <fche>	stooke, 10 seconds microwave oomph restores dry mochi to yumminess
Nov 29 13:54:54 <fche>	40 seconds turns it into mush

Dec 14 13:56:35 <mwringe>	lisac: yeah, sort of, it was a bit strange and we just really assembled them. I don't know why a baking a class would ever use pre-made tart shells
Dec 14 14:02:51 <lisac>	mwringe, taste just fine:-)
Dec 14 14:05:14 <mwringe>	lisac: yeah, they taste good. I just think it was weird to use premade shells. But maybe it was to save time. We did the mincemeat tarts, shortbread cookies, biscotti cookies and christmas cake all last night
Dec 14 14:07:56 <mwringe>	and tonight we finish the cookies and make panettone. I think tonight should be a shorter class
Dec 14 14:09:04 <lisac>	mwringe, christmas cake..soaked in rum?
Dec 14 14:10:02 <mwringe>	lisac: yes, with the fruits being soaked for the last couple of weeks.
Dec 14 14:11:19 <lisac>	mwringe,* i should be on pto during december when mwringe is at cooking school
Dec 14 14:14:04 <mwringe>	lisac: it smells and looks really good. I shared the tarts, I don't know if I will share the better stuff with the office :)

Dec 19 15:18:34 <LG>	i go by Rio time... ;-)
Dec 19 15:23:21 <steveg>	anyway, i dont mind, the earlier the better
Dec 19 15:26:13 <LG>	ok then...
Dec 19 15:35:03 <dcheung>	I thought that was 7 PM ET?
Dec 19 15:35:34 <dcheung>	oh yeah it's AM
Dec 19 15:37:53 <steveg>	dcheung, i dont think LG wants me tinkering with his VMs at 7 PM on a Friday, the results would be interesting tho
Dec 19 15:38:09 <steveg>	>:D
Dec 19 15:39:56 <dcheung>	I genuinely thought it would be better in PM. but oh well.
Dec 19 15:40:28 <steveg>	dcheung, i assume you mean from a nobody using them perspective?
Dec 19 15:41:38 <dcheung>	steveg: yeah. 7AM eastern time: the Brno guys might be using the mead-scheduler cause it's around 1pm in Brno
Dec 19 15:42:55 <steveg>	dcheung, well, from my POV i didn't get to set the time - im just going off what LG sent out
Dec 19 15:43:08 <steveg>	dcheung, that said i cant do that evening anyway, i could do it on thursday evening potentially
Dec 19 15:43:28 <dcheung>	steveg: nah it's fine. Friday morning 7AM EST. the notice is already sent anyways
Dec 19 15:44:20 <steveg>	dcheung, the other reason i am always hesitant to schedule these things at night is if something does go wrong i dont have as many of the virt support staff to lean on
Dec 19 15:44:34 <dcheung>	yeah makes sense!
Dec 19 15:44:53 <steveg>	(which has happened before, i had issues with the 2.3->3.0 upgrade where i had to get GSS help to rescue some images)
Dec 19 15:46:26 <LG>	steveg, dcheung wasn't thinking right.. i was aiming for 9 am TO time..  ...  
Dec 19 15:46:47 <steveg>	such is life
Dec 19 15:46:59 <LG>	tell me about it!
Dec 19 15:47:02 <steveg>	like dcheung said it is probably better to just stick to it now it is sent
Dec 19 15:47:10 <steveg>	ideally i am not going to need to full time allocated anyway
Dec 19 15:47:28 <LG>	well it not like its engraved in stone...
Dec 19 15:47:34 <LG>	but still i don't mind

Dec 22 12:32:05 <rgrunber>	it's quite the consistent typo.. every date field has it.
Dec 22 12:32:39 <rgrunber>	must have been a really good burger..
Dec 22 12:32:40 <sergiodj>	that was a very good burger
Dec 22 12:36:04 <rgrunber>	at this point i'm ready to flip a coin
Dec 22 12:36:57 <rgrunber>	ok so https://datatables.net/plug-ins/sorting/date-dd-MMM-yyyy is actually a thing.. therefore seems reasonable.
Dec 22 12:47:53 <alanm>	heh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country  "All three main types are used in Canada – in French and in English"

Dec 23 07:08:31 <steveg>	that's going to take a while so i am going to grab a coffee
Dec 23 07:08:44 <LG>	great idea!  me too
Dec 23 07:58:36 <steveg>	LG, toothless is back up, please verify that it is functioning as you expect
Dec 23 07:58:52 <steveg>	LG, assuming yes - that concludes the outage and you can send a response to your outage announcement confirming that
Dec 23 08:06:07 <LG>	so far, seems ok..  still checking
Dec 23 08:08:44 <LG>	steveg, yep.. all is good... :-)  Thanks Steve!!!

Jan 03 10:37:44 <patrickm>	someone dropped a BULA toque in front of my cave... i've crushed it in the hall closest door handle
Jan 03 10:40:15 <rgrunber>	scared me for a sec.. i have such a toque.. but mine is still in my bag
Jan 03 12:43:31 <LG>	steveg, is to-virt1 under your umbrella? 
Jan 03 12:48:37 <steveg>	LG, not really no - fche and deepak
Jan 03 12:48:40 <steveg>	LG, why?
Jan 03 12:49:19 <LG>	steveg, thanks!  have a VM on it (tooth) which i rebooted about an hour ago and it still hasn't come back
Jan 03 12:49:43 <steveg>	LG, VM is up 
Jan 03 12:50:01 <steveg>	LG, boot failed because it was unable to mount NFS filesystem /mnt/curly
Jan 03 12:50:07 <steveg>	LG, whatever that is when it's at home
Jan 03 12:50:26 <steveg>	actually more accurately it looks like the shutdown got stuck on this step
Jan 03 12:50:26 <LG>	oh
Jan 03 12:50:36 <steveg>	"device is busy"
Jan 03 12:50:53 <LG>	steveg, hehe..  could you take a shotgun to it?  
Jan 03 12:51:17 <steveg>	LG, sure - obviously whatever is writing to the device will not be happy - you can keep the pieces!
Jan 03 12:51:25 <LG>	:-)
Jan 03 12:51:47 <steveg>	it is booting now
Jan 03 12:51:50 <steveg>	also eww el5

Jan 03 12:52:17 <LG>	yeah...  i've been trying to get rid of this guy for the last 4 yrs!
Jan 03 12:52:49 <LG>	i even have a "replacement" on torricelli for it...  called testnewett  
Jan 03 12:56:04 <fche>	is there anything you'd like me to do with the tooth vm or to-virt1 host?
Jan 03 12:56:06 <fche>	just checking

Jan 03 13:04:47 <LG>	steveg, thanks!
Jan 03 13:32:41 <steveg>	fche, sorry was AFK - just confirming i rebooted the guest for LG and looks ok now
Jan 03 13:32:47 <fche>	righto
Jan 03 13:33:34 <steveg>	LG_lunch, im assuming that the inability to unmount the NFS share was because something in your guest was still using it and wouldn't let go - i think you would have to address that inside the guest

Jan 17 13:09:43 <rgrunber>	steveg: for Cygnus.. hmm i would guess ~30ish.
Jan 17 13:10:02 <rgrunber>	i think it could hold more but requires packing up the tables.. which has become more complicated now..
Jan 17 13:10:05 <steveg>	rgrunber, thanks yeah that is my usual guess just trying to validate im not completely off base
Jan 17 13:15:00 <rgrunber>	steveg: https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-990736 lists the capacity at 16, but i assume that's with the table as is and no stackable chairs (there's 24 of them) at the far back.

Jan 25 15:26:50 <lisac>	actuallly a few days after...as told in the presentation last week
Jan 25 15:27:26 <fche>	oh well, hoped to set it up before traveling
Jan 25 15:27:46 <lisac>	bring the zurich insurance information with you as well

Jan 25 15:28:20 <lisac>	Zurich Travel Assistance Info: http://www.zurich.co.uk/en/business/services/travel-assistance.   
Jan 25 15:28:54 <fche>	hm after what I read on thread, I may be better off getting something personal
Jan 25 15:29:10 <lisac>	you are covered....no need 
Jan 25 15:38:44 <mwringe>	lisac: I thought from the thread we were not adequately covered for even something relatively minor. But I wasn't paying too much attention to it. How much coverage do we have on this travel insurance?
Jan 25 15:40:48 <lisac>	mwringe, i have not read the full document however between Zurich and GWL/Manulife we have coverage for travel
Jan 25 15:41:09 *	fche doesn't think it's a simple yes/no question really
Jan 25 15:41:22 <steveg>	it's not
Jan 25 15:42:33 <steveg>	the response i eventually got from our "Treasury Risk Manager" when pressing regarding the zurich policy and pre-existing conditions involved the word "should"
Jan 25 15:42:55 <steveg>	not really that satisfactory having been left out in the cold by such a policy in a previous life
Jan 25 16:39:45 <steveg>	lisac, i posed the question on the mojo page for the zurich stuff
Jan 25 16:40:01 <steveg>	lisac, i think there is still an open question there as to which takes precedence for *business* travel
Jan 25 16:40:21 <lisac>	steveg; i know it is being worked on, such as providing a north american number in case of emergency
Jan 25 16:40:24 <steveg>	(notwithstanding the many other issues with the lack of detail on the actual zurich policy)
Jan 25 16:40:39 <steveg>	lisac, yes
Jan 25 16:40:45 <lisac>	Zurich takes precedence
Jan 25 16:40:52 <steveg>	lisac, i would think for business travel the zurich policy...yeah that
Jan 25 16:41:06 <steveg>	but as usual it would be good to have it written down rather than having folks to guess
Jan 25 16:41:22 <lisac>	they are working on a mojo page
Jan 25 16:41:23 <steveg>	the problem is im nosy so im going to ask now, but some poor sod is going to have to find all this out in an actual emergency
Jan 25 16:41:29 <steveg>	because we didnt write it down
Jan 25 16:42:16 <lisac>	I believe there is a card to print off within the given site ...is there not?
Jan 25 16:42:18 <steveg>	my other open is still about pre-existing conditions, the only answer i got was that they "should" be covered without any detail as to what that actually means
Jan 25 16:42:31 <steveg>	that is just a card with phone # / policy info
Jan 25 16:42:38 <steveg>	it doesnt help you establish what you are covered for
Jan 25 16:42:46 <lisac>	not many policies cover pre existing...even ones you buy privately
Jan 25 16:42:52 <steveg>	right
Jan 25 16:42:55 <steveg>	exactly my point
Jan 25 16:43:02 <steveg>	yet our folks tell us we are covered
Jan 25 16:43:13 <steveg>	without giving a definition for what zurich consider pre-existing
Jan 25 16:43:25 <lisac>	Manulife stated that there had to be no changes within 90 days
Jan 25 16:43:26 <steveg>	the 90 day thing mentioned by manulife is actually pretty generous
Jan 25 16:43:43 <steveg>	i have seen other policies say as much as any hospitalization/doctor/etc in 2 years
Jan 25 16:43:45 <steveg>	voids the coverage
Jan 25 16:44:39 <steveg>	lisac, anyway i know you are just the messenger :)

Jan 27 16:49:11 <patrickm>	mwringe: there was some gum stuck on my boot so i used kofola to burn it off
Jan 27 16:49:19 <mwringe>	:)
Jan 27 16:49:48 <patrickm>	mwringe: you have to admit, that stuff is at best an acquired taste
Jan 27 16:52:04 <mwringe>	patrickm: I didn't think it was that bad, there were people on my team who though it was amazing.

Jan 30 17:43:03 <patrickm>	xfnasser: i'll be back in the office thursday next week after FOSDEM
Jan 31 10:42:22 <rattapat>	guys, does anyone have access to the lab in toronto?
Jan 31 10:43:15 <steveg>	i do but im not in today
Jan 31 10:43:18 <rgrunber>	physical, yes.. myself and dcheung .. lberk too i would think.
Jan 31 10:43:22 <steveg>	lberk, and dbhole|brno are other candidates
Jan 31 10:43:30 <dcheung>	I'm not in today
Jan 31 10:43:43 <rgrunber>	i am.. if you need meet me by the lab :P
Jan 31 10:45:31 <rgrunber>	.. unless you need me to reboot/do something..
Jan 31 10:45:35 <rattapat>	rgrunber: haha .. I'm at a customer, but I have a machine that needs to be plugged in. I believe a sticker with my name "rajith" is on the box
Jan 31 10:45:57 <rattapat>	rgrunber: are you able to help out?
Jan 31 10:46:19 <rgrunber>	sure.. i'll give it a shot..
Jan 31 10:47:07 <rattapat>	rgrunber: thank you kind sir! much appreciated
Jan 31 10:47:08 <rgrunber>	is it already configured to take a static ip ?..
Jan 31 10:47:44 <rattapat>	rgrunber: I remember requesting one .. this has been out of commission for over 2 years. So can't recall
Jan 31 10:48:03 <rattapat>	rgrunber: there's a good chance it does have a static ip
Jan 31 10:55:28 <rgrunber>	rattapat: most of the machines have to- stickers.. i couldn't find any with your name. there is one that's silver iirc and about the size of a small box and couldn't find any markings on it.
Jan 31 10:56:12 <rattapat>	rgrunber: hmm... let me try to find that name ...sorry for wasting your time
Jan 31 10:56:35 <rgrunber>	np.. physical activity :P 
Jan 31 10:57:40 <rattapat>	rgrunber: iirc there was some sort of webpage that lists the toronto inventory .. do you know the link?
Jan 31 10:57:59 <dbhole|brno>	https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-983905
Jan 31 11:00:05 <rattapat>	rgrunber: to-Muditha  ... thanks Dpak!
Jan 31 11:00:32 <rgrunber>	hah.. i was just gonna say tooma2x, topke, beagle2, jck and muditha appeared to be not up.. yay muditha it is
Jan 31 11:00:58 <patrickm>	rattapat: is muditha your daughter
Jan 31 11:01:14 <rattapat>	patrickm: no my middle name :)
Jan 31 11:01:20 <patrickm>	rattapat: ok then
Jan 31 11:01:34 <rattapat>	patrickm: hahaha
Jan 31 11:02:54 <rattapat>	rgrunber: thanks again!
Jan 31 11:13:27 <rgrunber>	rattapat: tried starting it (was plugged in) but didn't start. the green light at the back on the power supply wasn't on. tried a different power cord and same thing :\
Jan 31 11:13:56 <rgrunber>	and didn't see one of those on/off switches for it so i assume it should be on the moment it's plugged in.
Jan 31 11:18:27 <rattapat>	rgrunber: ah I see

Feb 01 09:53:10 <jkang>	hi! a number of machines in the server room are inaccessible. I've checked them out and it seems the switch or router that assigns them ip addresses isn't doing so. One of the consoles on the rack shows something along the lines of 'ipv4 address acquiring dhcp'. Does anyone know what steps should be taken to resolve this?
Feb 01 09:53:52 <lisac>	all the printers were down as well..i just rebooted them
Feb 01 09:56:37 <steveg>	jkang, so it actually is handing out addresses
Feb 01 09:56:57 <steveg>	jkang, but a number of machines gave up asking so you have to ifdown / ifup the interfaces
Feb 01 09:57:00 <steveg>	jkang, or reboot
Feb 01 09:57:26 <steveg>	jkang, the rhev environment is up and between dcheung and i we should have got those VMs connecting again
Feb 01 09:57:38 <steveg>	jkang, and i can reboot any VMs on to-virt1 if required
Feb 01 09:57:44 <jkang>	steveg, okay; I'll try that out now then, thanks!
Feb 01 10:05:19 <dcheung>	jkang: yeah if you need any help let us know
Feb 01 10:09:21 <jkang>	restarting the interfaces worked out
Feb 01 10:09:33 <rgrunber>	jkang: yeah same ^
Feb 01 10:42:20 <law>	dcheung: any chance someone could look at tor & torsion?   I don't see any signs that they've come back up yet
Feb 01 10:44:26 <dcheung>	law: are they vms or physical machines?
Feb 01 10:46:26 <law>	they're physical machines
Feb 01 10:46:54 <dcheung>	jkang: could you go reboot them? I'm not in the office :(
Feb 01 10:47:23 <dcheung>	or restart their network
Feb 01 10:47:33 <jkang>	dcheung, do you know where they are? rgrunber was having trouble finding them
Feb 01 10:48:04 <dcheung>	:[ I don't know
Feb 01 10:48:22 <law>	let me see if I can find vlad on irc, he ought to know where they are
Feb 01 10:49:30 <vmakarov>	what is up
Feb 01 10:50:00 <law>	Vlad, can you tell jkang where tor/torsion are physically located?  they're looking to reboot them to get their networks running again
Feb 01 10:50:33 <vmakarov>	it is the most left cabinet (near the wall)
Feb 01 10:50:59 <vmakarov>	the both servers are dell R730
Feb 01 10:52:16 <vmakarov>	my suspicion is a router.  all my desktop computers are available.  but all my server machines are not available.
Feb 01 10:56:07 <vmakarov>	so it would be reasonable to try to reboot the servers and after that a router to which they are connected (if it is available because it might be in a cage which are not available for us).
Feb 01 10:59:58 <jkang>	the two dell r730s have been rebooted; hopefully it works out
Feb 01 11:01:19 <dcheung>	maybe we should put labels on them for the next time(tm)
Feb 01 11:03:57 <jkang>	where do the labels come from? there's another machine in there I want to label as well hahah..
Feb 01 11:04:24 <dcheung>	jkang: shout lisaccccccccccc!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Feb 01 11:05:14 <vmakarov>	jkang, dcheung: thank you.  putting labels has sense.  I'll put them my next visit to the office.
Feb 01 11:06:58 <law>	torsion seems to be up, but still doesn't have a DNS record and hasn't mounted /home...
Feb 01 11:09:10 <vmakarov>	law: /home on torsion is mounted.
Feb 01 11:09:41 <law>	and is has a DNS record now...  good :-)
Feb 01 11:10:02 <law>	I'll never remember 10.15.24.128 ;-)
Feb 01 11:12:12 <rgrunber>	jkang: if you can label toatom or whichever that was as well :P.. hard to expose the label on top..
Feb 01 11:12:37 <law>	jkang: tyvm...   
Feb 01 11:13:02 <rgrunber>	law: vmakarov also one of those machines had a PSU error.. 
Feb 01 11:13:45 <rgrunber>	flashed on scrolling display..
Feb 01 11:14:39 <vmakarov>	rgrunber: do you mean a Dell R730 server?
Feb 01 11:14:49 <rgrunber>	vmakarov: yes
Feb 01 11:15:43 <vmakarov>	rgrunber: is it a server with filled 6 disk bays?
Feb 01 11:15:55 <jkang>	vmakarov, rgrunber er; one of the cables was unplugged. I took the initiative and plugged it back in. The PSU warning disappeared... was that okay?
Feb 01 11:16:14 <jkang>	or was it unplugged on purpose..
Feb 01 11:16:27 <dcheung>	jkang: you just broke the matrix
Feb 01 11:18:38 <vmakarov>	jkang: i don't think it was unplugged on purpose.  the servers have 2 PSU.  the both PSU should be plugged.
Feb 01 11:20:28 <jkang>	vmakarov, I'm going to make a bulk request for stickers; I've added tor and torsion to the list. If you tell me which one is which I can label them for you; otherwise I'll leave the stickers with lisa and you can ask her next time you come into the office;
Feb 01 11:21:53 <vmakarov>	jkang: thanks.  I'll put the labels by myself my next office visit.
Feb 01 11:22:37 <jkang>	okay, sounds good!
Feb 01 11:24:36 <rgrunber>	vmakarov: ah ok I was there with jkang so if that fixed it, great. iirc it was for psu2..
Feb 01 11:25:13 <vmakarov>	unfortunately tor is still not responsive.  it is a server with 6 populated and 2 empty disk bays.
Feb 01 11:25:18 <rgrunber>	vmakarov: just came back though and saw : 'MEM0702 Correctable memory error rate exceeded for DIMM_A7. Reseat memory'
Feb 01 11:27:52 <vmakarov>	jkang: i think it is tor then because it is not reachable.  ok, i'll look at tor tomorrow.
Feb 01 11:29:22 <law>	vmakarov: sounds reasonable...  
Feb 01 11:37:16 <vmakarov>	law: tomorrow could be a good time to upgrade tor to FC25.  what is your opinion about that?
Feb 01 11:44:03 <law>	sure...  works for me...
Feb 01 11:44:51 <vmakarov>	law: ok. thanks.
Feb 01 12:40:23 <fnasser>	Has anyone received the promised e-mail with the "activation code" from Manulife?
Feb 01 12:40:56 <fnasser>	"Activation key" actually
Feb 01 12:42:41 <rgrunber>	fnasser: yes, it should have been in a second email. they came back to back for me.
Feb 01 12:43:05 <omajid_wfh>	fnasser: i got a mail with subject "Activate your access to the Manulife Plan Member Secure Site." that includes "Enter your personal site activation key - " followed by a bunch of letter and numbers
Feb 01 12:51:32 <lisac>	fnasser: I got mine shortly after registering as well however the code was not in their system when i went to enter it so I had to call in...they sent me a new code and all done...
Feb 01 12:53:11 <fnasser>	lisac I did not get any e-mail back yet, so I am keeping the page where it asks for the Activiation key up
Feb 01 12:53:35 <fnasser>	Maybe it will be there when I get back from lunch.  If not I will call them
Feb 01 12:54:20 <fnasser>	omajid_wfh, it seems that for me it would be more like rgrunber described.  Let me try and look again for it
Feb 01 12:54:57 <fnasser>	"An e-mail will be immediately sent to you containing your "Activation Key". Please follow the instructions contained in that e-mail."
Feb 01 12:55:26 <fnasser>	AHH!!!!  Red Hat filter considered it Junk!!!!
Feb 01 12:57:45 <fnasser>	I am in!
Feb 01 12:57:50 <fnasser>	Thanks everyone
Feb 01 15:15:39 <steveg>	rattapat, i forgot to ping you earlier - not sure if you noticed we had some residual networking issues overnight
Feb 01 15:16:00 <steveg>	rattapat, your VM is up in RHEV but you may need to log in to the portal and open a console to reset its networking if it has lost its IP
Feb 01 15:16:23 <steveg>	rattapat, the alternative hit it with a hammer approach is just to reboot it
Feb 01 15:43:31 <rattapat>	steveg: hey thanks... for some reason I was just able just ssh into it.
Feb 01 15:43:46 <rattapat>	steveg: I was never able to log into the console ...
Feb 01 15:44:03 <rattapat>	steveg: for some unfortunate reason it never recognized my credentials
Feb 01 15:46:00 <rattapat>	steveg: but at some point I want to sort that out so deepak doesn't have to keep creating vms for me :)
Feb 01 15:49:22 <steveg>	i dunno there's a lot to be said for annoying deepak
Feb 01 15:56:18 <rattapat>	steveg: hahah 
Feb 02 14:10:28 <rattapat>	rgrunber: steveg will one of you guys be around tomorrow at the office? I need access to the lab to get my machine going
Feb 02 14:15:17 <lisac>	rattapat, I can give you access if they are not here
Feb 02 14:15:36 <rattapat>	lisac thanks Lisa!
Feb 02 14:59:34 <rgrunber>	steveg: you're going to be in tomorrow ?
Feb 02 14:59:43 <rgrunber>	oh... nvm
Feb 02 14:59:44 <rgrunber>	misread that.
Feb 03 09:14:00 <patrickm>	fche: smooth travels back?
Feb 03 09:14:24 <fche>	yeah, just long long ... and the stopover at Boston Logan was as unpleasant as you hinted
Feb 03 09:14:35 <fche>	place = plague :)
Feb 03 09:15:16 <patrickm>	fche: there's only so many dunkin donuts you can consume
Feb 03 09:15:42 <fche>	or one too many sweaty-back patdowns after that 2km walk from one terminal to the other
Feb 03 10:13:17 <dcheung>	steveg: do you know if anyone in the RHEV team is working on a jenkins plugin for RHEV?
Feb 03 10:13:52 <steveg>	dcheung, honestly not sure - i would ask in #rhev-dev or on rhev-tech@redhat.com
Feb 03 10:14:08 <steveg>	dcheung, i know they have build new ansible modules but i have to  complete the move to RHV 4.0 for that
Feb 03 10:14:21 <steveg>	(which means we have to install rhel 7 on torrecelli at some point)
Feb 03 10:14:40 <dcheung>	steveg: if not, maybe I'll bug them to make the one I have become 'supported' by them
Feb 03 10:15:08 <dcheung>	I got it to connect to toner, grab the IP of the VM and then ssh to it
Feb 03 10:28:24 <steveg>	dcheung, connect via the api i assume?
Feb 03 10:30:21 <dcheung>	steveg: yeah connect to toner via the ovirt api
Feb 03 10:30:28 <dcheung>	to bring up/down the vm
Feb 03 10:30:31 <steveg>	dcheung, ok
Feb 03 10:30:43 <steveg>	dcheung, fyi i think in 4 they change the api but i think there is backwards compat until 4.1
Feb 03 10:32:38 <dcheung>	steveg: ohh thanks for the warning! I'm using an old client from 2014 I think
Feb 03 10:32:45 <dcheung>	will bump the version
Feb 03 10:32:52 <steveg>	dcheung, dont worry about it for now
Feb 03 10:32:57 <steveg>	dcheung, we wont be on 4 for a while :)
Feb 03 10:33:18 <steveg>	dcheung, to do the torrecelli upgrade i will need to move another host in that cluster to put the VMs on temporarily
Feb 03 10:33:54 <dcheung>	steveg: can you just bring them offline, backup, then do the upgrade?
Feb 03 10:36:25 <steveg>	dcheung, technically yes (the storage is already external) but it's safer/easier to do it with a  spare host
Feb 03 10:36:42 <steveg>	dcheung, just because if anything goes wrong and it takes longer than expected the workloads stay up
Feb 03 10:37:08 <steveg>	dcheung, do you folks have anything running directly on torricelli itself that i need to worry about?
Feb 03 10:37:15 <steveg>	(read: not in VMs)
Feb 03 10:39:25 <dcheung>	steveg: to my knowledge, no. LG: ^^ ?
Feb 03 10:40:47 <LG>	steveg, No
Feb 03 10:40:57 <LG>	steveg, what are you planning?
Feb 03 10:41:06 <steveg>	LG, basically:
Feb 03 10:41:22 <steveg>	1) move all VMs off one of to-virt3 or 4 (i have enough capacity free to do this)
Feb 03 10:41:30 <steveg>	2) move the now empty host to the EAP cluster
Feb 03 10:41:47 <steveg>	3) move VMs from torrecelli to new host in EAP cluster
Feb 03 10:41:55 <steveg>	4) reinstall torrecelli with RHEL 7
Feb 03 10:42:04 <steveg>	5) add torrecelli to RHEV again
Feb 03 10:42:11 <steveg>	6) move VMs back to torrecelli
Feb 03 10:42:18 <steveg>	7) move borrowed host back to default cluster
Feb 03 10:42:30 <steveg>	8) do the manager upgrade to RHV 4
Feb 03 10:42:33 <LG>	hum..
Feb 03 10:42:35 <steveg>	EOM
Feb 03 10:42:42 <LG>	when?
Feb 03 10:42:54 <steveg>	whenever really
Feb 03 10:42:59 <steveg>	the whole idea is there is no VM outage
Feb 03 10:44:07 <LG>	am waiting on fnasser to tell me when I can deactivate tomentum, so i can upgrade it to rhel 7 and add it to RHEV
Feb 03 10:44:42 <LG>	so, hopefully do it all in one haul ? ;-)
Feb 03 10:45:50 <fnasser>	LG steveg We need tomentum for a little more.  EAP 7.1 was delayed so we are still going on with 6.4.x.  Will look into using tonga though
Feb 03 10:46:14 <steveg>	fnasser, not sure that directly impacts what im talking about here
Feb 03 10:46:35 <steveg>	read: i do not need tomentum to complete any of the above
Feb 03 10:46:43 <LG>	steveg, fnasser yeah... i'll hold off tomentum and we can go for what needs be done with torricelli then
Feb 03 10:47:20 <steveg>	also a Q that came up after the other day's shenanigans
Feb 03 10:47:29 <steveg>	do those machines have the remote management interface configured?
Feb 03 10:47:42 <steveg>	if not i will set that up as well
Feb 03 10:47:54 <steveg>	it's v. handy if you need to reboot or get a console remotely
Feb 03 10:48:19 <LG>	hum...  i can't remember..  some things are still fuzzy... am guessing no
Feb 03 10:49:55 <LG>	I agree
Feb 03 10:50:58 <dcheung>	steveg: by that do you mean: the guest rhev agent rpm + service you install in the vms?
Feb 03 10:51:08 <steveg>	dcheung, nah im talking about the physical boxes
Feb 03 10:51:16 <dcheung>	ah!
Feb 03 10:51:44 <steveg>	dcheung, they have a management module that if it's wired up to ethernet and configured you can use to perform some management/maintenance tasks even if the box itself is stuck for some reason
Feb 03 10:51:58 <dcheung>	fancy!

Feb 03 13:23:00 <rgrunber>	damn that hurts the ears!
Feb 03 14:35:57 <dcheung>	steveg: what do I need to do to make some of the RHEV templates available in the EAP_Productization cluster?
Feb 03 14:52:33 <steveg>	dcheung, existing ones?
Feb 03 14:53:31 <steveg>	dcheung, it's a bit clunky but basically you want to attach the ExportNew domain to the Default cluster, export the templates to it
Feb 03 14:53:49 <steveg>	dcheung, then detach the ExportNew domain and attach it to EAP_Productization and import them there
Feb 03 14:54:11 <dcheung>	steveg: ok, will try!
Feb 03 14:54:38 <steveg>	dcheung, if you have any issues let me know, it does take a while as it is actually making complete copies of the templates
Feb 03 14:55:07 <steveg>	dcheung, so at the end of the process there will be a version of the template on both the NFS that backs the Default cluster and the SAN that backs the EAP cluster
Feb 03 14:55:45 <steveg>	i need to script the template creation so it does both at the same for when we get a new RHEL release but it's not something i've gotten around to
Feb 03 14:57:44 <dcheung>	gotcha
Feb 03 15:31:41 <rgrunber>	does anyone know offhand why /vol/engarchive2 won't mount.. on vtap-eng01.storage.rdu2.redhat.com ?
Feb 03 15:34:24 <rgrunber>	phew.. so it's not just me..
Feb 03 15:35:47 <dcheung>	rgrunber: they changed the NFS drive
Feb 03 15:35:49 <dcheung>	one momento

Feb 08 13:59:26 <dcheung>	steveg: weird question: what permissions does the eapbatch user need to have to talk to toner via its API?
Feb 08 13:59:41 <dcheung>	does it actually require superuser permissions?
Feb 08 14:23:15 <steveg>	dcheung, it actually depends what functions it wants to execute
Feb 08 14:23:26 <steveg>	dcheung, that is, going through the api it has the same permissions it has via the UI
Feb 08 14:23:32 <dcheung>	steveg: just listing vms
Feb 08 14:23:34 <dcheung>	hmmmm
Feb 08 14:23:46 <steveg>	dcheung, should be able to do that with just the user level perms
Feb 08 14:23:56 <steveg>	dcheung, but perhaps you are listing VMs it doesnt have perms on?
Feb 08 14:24:26 <steveg>	dcheung, say i log in on my normal user account, i can list VMs, but i cant list *your* VMs unless you explicitly added me in the permissions?
Feb 08 14:25:42 <dcheung>	I'm just doing api.getVMs().list()
Feb 08 14:26:09 <dcheung>	so I don't know, maybe the 'getVMs()' call does list vms I don't have permissions
Feb 08 14:29:08 <dcheung>	I think I removed some scary permissions on eapbatch and that's why this is now failing. will investigate more
Feb 08 14:29:12 <steveg>	mmm it should be smart enough to just not show them
Feb 08 14:45:33 <dcheung>	oh it's failing at 'GET /api' with basic auth
Feb 08 14:45:51 <dcheung>	code  : 400
Feb 08 14:45:51 <dcheung>	reason: Bad Request
Feb 08 14:45:52 <dcheung>	detail: query execution failed due to insufficient permissions.
Feb 08 14:49:20 <steveg>	dcheung, can you auth using its creds at https://toner.yyz.redhat.com/ovirt-engine/api
Feb 08 14:49:21 <steveg>	?
Feb 08 14:49:46 <steveg>	dcheung, guess not, i cant with my regular user account either
Feb 08 14:50:36 <dcheung>	steveg: url I'm hitting is: https://toner.yyz.redhat.com:443/api
Feb 08 14:53:27 <steveg>	ends up in the same place ;)
Feb 08 14:55:57 <steveg>	let me ask in sbr-virt
Feb 08 15:00:29 <steveg>	dcheung, https://access.redhat.com/solutions/431653
Feb 08 15:00:35 <steveg>	Needs one of:
Feb 08 15:00:36 <steveg>	HostAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:36 <steveg>	Cluster Admin
Feb 08 15:00:36 <steveg>	DC Admin
Feb 08 15:00:36 <steveg>	GlusterAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:36 <steveg>	HostAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:38 <steveg>	NetworkAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:40 <steveg>	StorageAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:42 <steveg>	SuperUser
Feb 08 15:00:44 <steveg>	TemplateAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:46 <steveg>	VmPoolAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:54 <steveg>	i would suggest give it Cluster Admin on the EAP cluster specifically
Feb 08 15:01:32 <steveg>	and you know, use a super secure password... ;p
Feb 08 15:05:40 <dcheung>	well we're not using the most common secure password as password this time
Feb 08 15:05:49 <dcheung>	we're using the 2nd most common one
Feb 08 15:06:12 <yobshans>	dcheung, hi, if you use REST API call to /ovirt-engine/api/vms you have to provide "Authorization" in http header as encrypted password such as YWRtaW5AaW50ZXJuYWw6cXVtNW5ldA==
Feb 08 15:06:36 <dcheung>	yobshans: I'm using the ovirt java sdk
Feb 08 15:07:00 <dcheung>	I see something like that when I run the api in debug mode
Feb 08 15:07:14 <yobshans>	dcheung: should b e similar, no?
Feb 08 15:07:59 <dcheung>	yup I guess the sdk is just a wrapper for the REST APIs
Feb 08 15:09:54 <yobshans>	https://www.base64encode.org/
Feb 08 15:10:48 <dcheung>	there's also the base64 command, but the java sdk does the encoding for me
Feb 08 15:22:41 <steveg>	yobshans, it's not the auth that is the issue
Feb 08 15:22:53 <steveg>	yobshans, it's authing but the account needs certain permissions to access the api
Feb 08 15:23:02 <steveg>	yobshans, permissions it did not have
Feb 08 15:27:24 <yobshans>	steveg, ok, I see
Feb 08 15:29:05 <dcheung>	steveg: so I added the Cluster Admin permission, but I couldn't figure out how to add it to the eapbatch user directly. If I instead click on a vm, then on its permissions tab, then I can add that ClusterAdmin permission. it's weird
Feb 08 15:29:13 <dcheung>	but it works! thanks for the help steveg ! :)
Feb 08 15:29:35 <steveg>	dcheung, yeah the permissions are tied to objects
Feb 08 15:29:48 <steveg>	dcheung, so to give it on the cluster you have to select the cluster and go to its permissions tab
Feb 08 15:29:55 <steveg>	dcheung, and add eapbatch there
Feb 08 15:29:59 <steveg>	dcheung, it's a bit roundabout
Feb 08 15:30:17 <dcheung>	ah gotcha, will do that

Feb 09 10:29:32 <patrickm>	chrisphi_: had several westvletern 12 | 8 + corsendonk christmas ales... pmuldoon knocked over a full chalice of westvletern 12... broke the chalice too... it was a sad day
Feb 09 10:29:54 <chrisphi_>	:-(
Feb 09 10:31:09 <chrisphi_>	patrickm: How was the  corsendonk christmas ale?
Feb 09 10:32:19 <patrickm>	chrisphi_: it's one of my favourite ales... not a fan of their pater though
Feb 09 10:32:54 <chrisphi_>	Have to try it sometime....
Feb 09 10:34:35 <patrickm>	chrisphi_: i had to pay out 10 EUR to pmuldoon, I bet him he couldn't drink a full serving of Mort Subite's house gueuze... never bet against a Welshman when beer is concerned, no matter how bad it is 
Feb 09 10:35:06 <patrickm>	[well. 10 EUR == next two rounds]
Feb 09 10:35:18 <chrisphi_>	Ah no wonder he knocked over the chalice, ;-)
Feb 09 11:15:33 <patrickm>	mwringe: https://about.mattermost.com/  to further the conversation
Feb 09 11:16:39 <mwringe>	so its basically a slack clone which is opensource
Feb 09 11:19:16 <steveg>	patrickm, do i need to reserve more or less CPUs for it than the slack client?
Feb 09 11:20:13 <patrickm>	mwringe: there seems to be a few more features as well BUT i don't know if they are useful
Feb 09 11:21:30 <patrickm>	steveg: dunno... matt and i were just talking about xchat/hexchat/slack in the kitchen and i noted that the developer program is moving to mattermost... i have no experience using it
Feb 09 11:23:21 <rgrunber>	eclipse foundation is pushing it to some extent..
Feb 09 11:24:34 <steveg>	patrickm, slack is godawful but since the k8s community is there i am somewhat stuck with it
Feb 09 11:25:31 <patrickm>	rgrunber: are you a mattermost user?
Feb 09 11:26:24 <rgrunber>	no
Feb 09 11:26:36 <patrickm>	steveg: your opinion of slack differs from mwringe's... we must settle this the "Ring of Death"
Feb 09 11:27:13 <steveg>	patrickm, it's not really the slack experience itself that bugs me
Feb 09 11:27:20 <steveg>	patrickm, it's the performance of the linux client
Feb 09 11:28:13 <dcheung>	is it worse than the web interface?
Feb 09 11:38:47 <steveg>	dcheung, it's basically the same but wrapped in its own process
Feb 09 11:39:01 <steveg>	dcheung, so i primarily use it this way so it can be killed separately
Feb 09 11:42:11 <dcheung>	gotcha
Feb 09 12:08:10 <rattapat>	has anybody played with openshift origin? willing to help with a few installation issues? :)
Feb 09 13:11:02 <steveg>	rattapat, barely
Feb 09 13:11:11 <steveg>	rattapat, i've only really used oc cluster up
Feb 09 13:12:33 <dcheung>	jlebon: ^^ ?
Feb 09 13:13:46 <jlebon>	rattapat: i can try, though i mostly use *oc cluster up* as well
Feb 09 13:14:04 <rattapat>	steveg: jlebon I'm struggling with exposing my services deployed on OS. My routing config is wrong or I'm missing a critical piece 
Feb 09 13:15:12 <jlebon>	ahh, heh. btw the kube site has a whole article dedicated to service troubleshooting
Feb 09 13:15:15 <jlebon>	https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/debugging-services/
Feb 09 13:20:29 <dcheung>	rattapat: is it about DNS re-routing to your service?
Feb 09 13:28:42 <rattapat>	dcheung: yes I think so
Feb 09 13:28:47 <rattapat>	jlebon: thanks for the link
Feb 09 13:30:47 <rattapat>	jlebon: btw my understanding is that routers and routes is an openshift concept built on top of kubernetis

Mar 09 08:54:38 <mwringe_>	is zimbra down for anyone else?
Mar 09 09:07:06 <steveg>	mwringe_, yeah
Mar 09 09:07:15 <steveg>	mwringe_, i assume IT is trying to resource starve us to gmail ;p
Mar 09 09:07:27 <mwringe_>	:)
Mar 09 09:07:45 <steveg>	mwringe_, http://post-office.corp.redhat.com/archives/outage-list/2017-March/msg00139.html
Mar 09 09:07:50 <mwringe_>	they are rebooting zimbra since they have been having intermittent issues lately -> http://post-office.corp.redhat.com/archives/outage-list/2017-March/msg00139.html
Mar 09 09:07:55 <steveg>	they are turning it off and on again
Mar 09 09:08:02 <mwringe_>	yeah
Mar 09 09:08:04 <steveg>	>:D
Mar 09 09:08:44 <mwringe_>	turning things off and on again is surprising the recommended solution for most computer issues, which is really sad
Mar 09 09:09:24 <mwringe_>	its even built into Kubernetes/OpenShift as a means of automatically trying to fix problems
Mar 09 09:10:49 <steveg>	my approach in openstack land is to reprovision it and THEN turn it off and on ;p
Mar 09 09:14:35 <rgb>	isn't that part of the the "pets vs cattle" ethos?
Mar 09 09:15:07 <rgb>	so it wasn't just me and zimbra not seeing eye to eye...

Mar 13 10:28:51 <mwringe_>	the boring machines is being brought out of the ground if anyone is interested
Mar 13 10:29:18 <rgrunber>	mwringe_: yeah i heard.. right now ? we have a decent view from your side ?

Mar 13 10:40:15 <rgrunber>	does this mean all that construction equipment will finally get off our lawn.. ?
Mar 13 10:40:24 <steveg>	rgrunber, probably not lol
Mar 13 10:40:36 <steveg>	rgrunber, just different equipment ! :P
Mar 13 10:40:44 <rgrunber>	yay.. more walking the long way around
Mar 13 10:42:09 <steveg>	rgrunber, i imagine they will fix that up
Mar 13 10:42:29 <steveg>	rgrunber, but i think the utilities relocation stuff at the yonge/eg intersection is still going to be going on for a while

Mar 27 15:49:56 <lisac>	I believe it is still 200 every 2 years

Apr 03 09:32:38 <patrickm>	Highlander: decent CDN->USD conversion rate for ESPP
Apr 03 09:33:38 <patrickm>	Highlander: i had forgotten that the amount between strike price [lower-15%] and FMV on March 31 was taxed at income tax rates... let's see how this goes ;)
Apr 03 09:37:25 <Highlander>	yeah, full on taxes since its a benefit, not a capital gain :-)
Apr 03 09:38:28 <dcheung>	Q since I'm confused: when does it count as income tax, and when does it count as capital gain?
Apr 03 09:38:43 <dcheung>	do we have the same rules as in the US?
Apr 03 09:38:54 <Highlander>	capital gain is when you own a stock.. it goe sup in value and you sell the stock.  the difference is a capital gain.
Apr 03 09:38:56 <Highlander>	different rules
Apr 03 09:39:06 <fche>	'sup dog
Apr 03 09:39:14 <Highlander>	you didnt own the stock iun the ESPP until they collect the money and buy them for you at the end of the period
Apr 03 09:40:07 <dcheung>	ah gotcha gotcha
Apr 03 09:40:09 <Highlander>	so you are receiving a benefit from the comany for the difference between what the current price is and what they are selling them to you for :-P
Apr 03 09:41:16 <fche>	so that 15% discount is only a (say) 8% benefit
Apr 03 09:41:22 <Highlander>	yueah
Apr 03 09:42:07 <fche>	and then you pay capital gains taxes on that 8% (or more or less, depending on when you sell)
Apr 03 09:42:53 <Highlander>	no, the FMV the day you get them is your price..  you bought them at the discount, paid the tax on the difference, so the closing price friday is you cost basis going forwrd
Apr 03 09:43:00 <dmsimard>	I'd wager it's just a rather safe way to buy stock -- the lowest price between start and end closing - 15%
Apr 03 09:43:10 <dmsimard>	Can't really go wrong with that
Apr 03 09:43:16 <fche>	does espp work by withholding money out of every paycheque?  so in essence one is giving RH a six-month loan?
Apr 03 09:43:18 <Highlander>	no you cat
Apr 03 09:43:27 <dmsimard>	fche: yeah it's a % out of every pay check
Apr 03 09:43:40 <Highlander>	no you cant go wrong :-)
Apr 03 09:43:59 <dmsimard>	fche: it's a % of salary before taxes
Apr 03 09:44:17 <Highlander>	yeah well its not really much of a loan :-)
Apr 03 09:44:58 <Highlander>	certainly wouldnt cover the cost of the plan :-)
Apr 03 09:55:46 <patrickm>	Highlander: it was a good investment, as long as the current price stays similar [or higher] ;)
Apr 03 09:59:21 <mjw>	patrickm, sorry for still being grumpy. But I got you a present. Well maybe. Something that gets our minds off it. Or maybe just to show I am weird.
Apr 03 09:59:28 <mjw>	Except I made a mistake... Don't I always.
Apr 03 09:59:46 <mjw>	I ordered it through amazon.ca thinking it would get to you quicker.
Apr 03 10:00:14 <mjw>	Except then the reseller was in the UK... So the delivery is early May, not early April.
Apr 03 10:00:25 <mjw>	At which point it really doesn't make any sense anymore.
Apr 03 10:00:37 <mjw>	But heay, at least you got more than 2 days notice...
Apr 03 10:02:06 <patrickm>	mjw: thanks [i think]

Apr 10 14:55:42 <fche>	aww, the weather gods are sending you the thunderstorms that just skimmed us
Apr 10 15:14:02 <alanm>	yep.. getting dark out there.
Apr 10 15:31:01 <alanm>	and ... the sky is falling ..
Apr 10 16:34:27 <Highlander>	btw...   for those interested in what ahppened after the poll:    https://goo.gl/photos/zeukydNXLEBMMMBm8
Apr 10 16:35:37 <dcheung>	you got all of them?
Apr 10 16:36:10 <Highlander>	no, all pitures of the same one.. boy #1.  the rest are all spoken for.. so no temptation to do anything crazy like that :-)
Apr 10 16:36:26 <Highlander>	name undecided yet.. another month before pickup
Apr 10 16:57:17 <mwringe>	wait, you are not going to call him "boy #1"?
Apr 10 16:58:00 <fche>	was half-expecting a less hairy creature to be called 'boy #1' :-)
Apr 10 17:09:52 <Highlander>	simply his label from the poll :-)     there will be no less-hairy boy #1. 
Apr 10 17:21:43 <patrickm>	Highlander: confirmed... a lighter than normal pay on April 15 for those that were in the ESPP period that just ended
Apr 10 17:45:38 <Highlander>	ah, actually taking it out of pay.  interesting.  I thought/hoped maybe they'd just bump the Taxable benefit number and let the chips fall at tax time :-)
Apr 10 17:54:21 <dmsimard>	patrickm: define lighter than normal
Apr 10 17:54:47 <dmsimard>	patrickm: I withdrew from the ESPP (set to 0% for next period) so I'm expecting it to be "heavier" than normal :p

Apr 12 12:54:30 <rgb>	ah, the M$ Windows tech support solution...
Apr 12 12:55:20 <steveg>	the difference is these days you reboot the browser instead of the computer
Apr 12 23:56:24 <rgb>	steveg: true enough.  :-(
Apr 13 07:54:53 <dmsimard>	Whoever forewarned that payday would be hurt by ESPP, you were right
Apr 13 08:13:06 <patrickm>	indeed
Apr 13 08:14:02 <patrickm>	i assume the paystubs will be loaded on ADP tonight so you can see just how much ESPP helps the government too!
Apr 13 08:14:42 <patrickm>	clearly a win-win... although i'd really like these taxed as cap gains ;)
Apr 13 08:31:19 <Highlander>	wouldnt we all. 
Apr 13 08:36:03 <dmsimard>	I suck at taxes -- but I guess that means you get taxed twice ? Once on pay stub and once when selling stock ?
Apr 13 08:46:46 <patrickm>	dmsimard: well, it depends on if you sell for a gain or loss
Apr 13 08:46:55 <patrickm>	dmsimard: either way, it'll be a cap gain or loss

Apr 21 11:16:20 <rgrunber>	if RH hosts it.. it's probably down.. clearly we should moved everything over to the non-RH cloud overlords
Apr 21 11:16:39 <yzhang>	time to migrate to azure

Apr 21 12:57:12 <atgreen>	is there an email outage right now?
Apr 21 13:01:14 <mwringe>	atgreen: its a lot more than just email
Apr 21 13:01:26 <efraim>	atgreen, there seems to be a phx2 networking issues since 10:30am ET... http://status.fedoraproject.org/ http://status.redhat.com/
Apr 21 13:01:48 <atgreen>	yes... the phx vpn wasn't working for me either
Apr 21 13:03:04 <rgrunber>	I saw one person in the office have email (through gmail).. however i lost my credentials (likely after reconnecting) and i'm pretty sure saml.redhat.com is managed by us.. hence down.. so basically no e-mail unless your sso ticket or w/e persisted.
Apr 21 13:03:49 <mwringe>	or if you are still on zimbra, no email at all
Apr 21 13:03:55 <atgreen>	I'm in gmail.. it's just that there hasn't been any new email for me since 10:33
Apr 21 13:04:16 <efraim>	gmail workaround is <kerbid>@gapps.redhat.com
Apr 21 13:05:03 <atgreen>	efraim: you mean if people send mail to green@gapps.redhat.com I'll get it?
Apr 21 13:06:04 <atgreen>	don't we normally get ISAAC alerts on major outages like this?
Apr 21 13:06:35 <efraim>	atgreen, it should work cause it goes to gmail, not redhat
Apr 21 13:06:52 <atgreen>	ha! I just got an ISAAC alert!
Apr 21 13:06:59 <efraim>	ISAAC alert via email ?
Apr 21 13:07:09 <rgrunber>	or txt..
Apr 21 13:07:09 <atgreen>	no.. android app
Apr 21 13:07:29 <rgrunber>	what's it say.. apocalypse ?
Apr 21 13:08:11 <atgreen>	it says that they don't know what's going on, but it's big
Apr 21 13:08:51 <atgreen>	I mean, the outage is big.  Major connectivity problems to primary DC.
Apr 21 13:09:43 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, it says happy early weekend :P
Apr 21 13:10:01 <efraim>	yeap... it's huuuuuge.... no access to sddc, bz, email, etc... end of the world as we know it

Apr 21 13:41:44 <fche>	let's talk about it on irc
Apr 21 13:41:47 <fche>	endlessly
Apr 21 13:42:10 <mjw>	actually thanks to shade (is he toronto based?) icedtea.classpath.org is finally pretty fast and responsive.
Apr 21 13:42:40 <mjw>	And who said running stuff out of your basement was a bad idea? :)
Apr 21 13:43:43 <mjw>	(OK, I am lying, that server actually is not in my basement, but it could :)
Apr 21 14:18:32 <atgreen>	@RedHatSupport on twitter says that the portal outage has been fixed.  Hopefully mail will be next.
Apr 21 14:26:35 <steveg>	if we'd been running systemd in a container this would never have happened /s
Apr 21 14:27:04 <rgrunber>	^ it wasn't system's fault.. just some random person complained about systemd on the slashdot article
Apr 21 14:27:34 <rgrunber>	i know you meant /s, but just wanted to make sure you didn't think it really was systemd :P
Apr 21 14:31:23 <efraim>	atgreen, http://status.redhat.com/ Identified - We have identified the issue and are working to resolve the problem. Apr 21, 13:52 EDT 
Apr 21 14:31:54 <chrisphi_>	Is Deepak in office today?

Apr 21 14:43:24 <steveg>	beside PHX2 is probably mostly running on like RHEL 4
Apr 21 14:43:25 *	steveg ducks
Apr 21 14:44:28 <alanm>	yeah but everybody likes to blame systemd :)
Apr 21 14:46:49 <patrickm>	chrisphi_: he's at the doctor, and he's going home after iirc
Apr 21 14:47:52 <chrisphi_>	patrickm: thx, we were mtg for 1-1/compass, I think via bj... so I'll just camp out on his bj #
Apr 21 14:48:23 <patrickm>	true story alanm... before systemd i had hair
Apr 21 14:48:37 <patrickm>	chrisphi_: he may be stuck, text him
Apr 21 14:49:06 *	chrisphi_ doesn't know his ph#
Apr 21 14:49:37 <patrickm>	chrisphi_: i txt'd for you
Apr 21 14:49:43 <alanm>	patrickm: We ALL had more hair back then. And we were 20 pounds lighter  as well. ;-)
Apr 21 14:49:52 <chrisphi_>	patrickm: thx again!
Apr 21 14:50:47 <patrickm>	alanm: yeah, but i blame systemd [and steveg a little... but mostly systemd]
Apr 21 14:52:00 <alanm>	as it continues to grow and assimilate more and more services until it becomes self aware and puts itself out of it's misery.
Apr 21 14:52:17 <patrickm>	chrisphi_: and he's on ;)
Apr 21 14:52:31 <chrisphi_>	ok
Apr 21 14:53:51 <patrickm>	alanm: nah, we'll just wrap systemd in a container and shoot it in the cloud at which time the microservices will eat it... at least if my understanding is correct
Apr 21 14:54:50 <alanm>	patrickm: decomposed into binary grey goo

Apr 25 15:47:55 <patrickm>	bryan came in via ArsDigita... i like their "employee of the month gets to drive the compay ferrari" award 
Apr 25 15:48:33 <patrickm>	fnasser: yeah, RHAPS with archit, rafi too... i wonder how many of them are left
Apr 25 15:50:22 <fnasser>	patrickm, true
Apr 25 15:51:12 <patrickm>	fnasser: dennis and jon are still around... it was a good team... and they really hated ObjectWeb
Apr 25 15:52:11 <fnasser>	We had a Vlad in that group that was good at finding JRE bugs
Apr 25 16:03:44 <steveg>	patrickm, i dunno about RHAPS but there are still at least 2 folks on the team i work with from ArsDigita
Apr 25 16:03:59 <patrickm>	steveg: whom?
Apr 25 16:04:08 <steveg>	patrickm, dan berrange and matt booth
Apr 25 16:04:38 <patrickm>	fnasser: ah yes, i forgot about vlad
Apr 25 16:05:02 <jkang>	drive the company ferrari? that sounds like something we should do :D
Apr 25 16:05:17 <patrickm>	steveg: good to know... although those 2 were never in our groups
Apr 25 16:06:01 <steveg>	patrickm, they floated through the various iterations of rhel virt until they ended up in the openstack compute team
Apr 25 16:06:07 <patrickm>	jkang: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArsDigita including the car!
Apr 25 16:08:57 <jkang>	"In 2002, ArsDigita's main assets (including the pinball machine and several pieces of artwork) were acquired by Red Hat." Pinball machine and artwork? I wonder where they are now...
Apr 25 16:09:21 <csanting>	"During the spring of 1999, for example, recruiting 5 hires would earn the employee a Honda S2000. Recruiting 10 employees would net a Ferrari F355."
Apr 25 16:09:39 <csanting>	that would be a nice bonus
Apr 25 16:09:42 <steveg>	jkang, there actually is a pinball machine in the cafeteria in westford
Apr 25 16:10:29 <steveg>	remind me to include that on this years facilities survey
Apr 25 16:10:31 <steveg>	:p
Apr 25 16:12:29 <mwringe_>	it sounds like things were a bit more lavish before the dot com bubble
Apr 25 16:19:36 <rgrunber>	did everyone have their own office hammocks ?
Apr 25 19:22:39 <fche>	the dot-com era ... will never forget the   "you can pry my aeron off my cold dead a**" slogan 
Apr 27 11:14:42 <patrickm>	looking to try something new around the office for lunch... anyone have recommendations?
Apr 27 11:15:23 <yzhang>	I feel like anything we've been to you've also been to
Apr 27 11:15:52 <dmsimard>	silly question, payday is monday right ? not tomorrow ?
Apr 27 11:16:22 <dmsimard>	silly question^2, quarterly bonus is in this payday ?
Apr 27 11:17:09 <rgrunber>	patrickm: Prohibition opened in the area a little while ago.. though it's a bar, it does have a lunch menu-ish https://static1.squarespace.com/static/560ffba5e4b01402b9023d8d/t/58ee01f01e5b6c8ff1895a1b/1491993076447/Lunch+Menu+31MAR17.pdf
Apr 27 11:18:02 <patrickm>	yzhang: honestly, that's not true... I stopped going out for lunch just over 2 years ago so most of the new places i've not hit
Apr 27 11:18:18 <lisac>	dmsimard, payday is tomorrow...last business day of the month.
Apr 27 11:18:41 <patrickm>	dmsimard: your pay will probably hit your bank tomorrow or Saturday
Apr 27 11:18:52 <lberk>	sushi burrito? http://rolltation.com/
Apr 27 11:18:55 <dmsimard>	lisac: ah, "last business day of the month", thanks -- I thought it was "first business day of the month" :)
Apr 27 11:19:16 <yzhang>	patrickm: I see, in that case I recommend the wisdom of ipun 
Apr 27 11:19:36 <rgrunber>	lberk++
Apr 27 11:19:51 <rgrunber>	never had.. but hmmm
Apr 27 11:20:21 <patrickm>	rgrunber: it's good to see the old Boston Pizza space reused... thanks
Apr 27 11:20:29 <yzhang>	rolltation is pretty good
Apr 27 11:20:31 <rgrunber>	finally
Apr 27 11:21:29 <patrickm>	rgrunber: we're have a mid size Red Hat Developer engineering meeting at the office in June, I may scope that place out for a dinner 
Apr 27 11:21:36 <patrickm>	having*
Apr 27 11:58:03 <ipun>	patrickm: theres nothing really THAT good around here unforunately :/
Apr 27 11:59:38 <rgrunber>	ipun: stuff is coming up.. i kinda wonder what's gonna go in the Spring Rolls space.
Apr 27 12:46:58 <patrickm>	rollation it was
Apr 27 12:57:25 <dcheung>	ipun: hosu
Apr 27 13:17:57 <steveg>	patrickm, chef of india it is then? :p
Apr 27 13:24:38 <rgrunber>	steveg: tempting given the number of times we had to cross to avoid construction..
Apr 27 14:01:14 <ipun>	dcheung: you LOVE hosu dont you
Apr 27 14:01:53 <patrickm>	ipun: i do like their udon... or did, haven't had it in about 10 years there ;)
Apr 27 14:02:17 <ipun>	patrickm: i only had their salad there which was alright
Apr 27 14:03:01 <dcheung>	hosu is life
Apr 27 15:01:54 <rgrunber>	hmm https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?on61#14104088510448498201704270503ww1171cwto
Apr 27 15:32:02 <steveg>	not again lol
Apr 27 15:32:20 <steveg>	thus far in a 4 week social soccer comp we have played in snow and rain only lol
Apr 27 15:36:05 <dcheung>	steveg: what position do you play?
Apr 27 15:36:20 <steveg>	goalie mostly lol
Apr 27 15:37:14 <dcheung>	a guy who can run a marathon should play like gareth bale! just keep on running
Apr 27 15:38:21 <patrickm>	hmmmm.... social soccer you say steveg 
Apr 27 15:38:36 <steveg>	i have a habit of swapping with someone else and having a run towards the end when everyone else is gassed lol
Apr 27 15:38:54 *	patrickm wonders if the office could get a team for the summer
Apr 27 15:41:22 <Jmatsuok>	patrickm, some of us played with the oldterns before they left
Apr 27 15:50:26 <patrickm>	Jmatsuok: we haven't really had any "official" office teams since the IBM baseball league either folded or kicked us out
Apr 27 15:50:43 <omajid>	which one was it? :)
Apr 27 15:51:32 <patrickm>	omajid: jjohnstn|wfh would know the answer to that question
Apr 27 16:29:43 <jkang>	I would be up for soccer :)
Apr 28 13:56:34 <rgrunber>	lisac: i would try turning it off/on again.. it's always worked for me.. it'll probably work again.. maybe i just got lucky. also if it's on right now there's definitely some networking issue as i can't reach the admin panel via web interface.
Apr 28 14:01:20 <lisac>	rg
Apr 28 14:01:32 <lisac>	rgrunber, I will put a ticket in, thanks
Apr 28 14:33:26 <rgrunber>	lisac: seems to be up again..

May 01 10:45:33 <fche>	rgrunber, you need to run that on the subnet/vlan that you are concerned about though
May 01 10:45:50 <mjw>	That was a fairly long time ago though. But I do remember visiting the Toronto office before I worked at RH :)
May 01 10:46:34 <fche>	come out screaming?    nah, only if you ran some naughty stuff like a dhcp or yp server
May 01 10:46:39 <fche>	then out would come the fire axe

May 04 12:25:40 <patrickm>	alanm: you know, the OpenShift.io training would be an excellent use of your time [ + your contract states you have to appear at the office once every 10 years]
May 04 12:26:19 <alanm>	when is it ?
May 04 12:26:20 <patrickm>	alanm: swing by Highlander's castle on the way! 
May 04 12:26:52 <patrickm>	June 5 or 6 or 7... whichever floats your boat 
May 04 12:27:56 <alanm>	Highlander still living in that palace in Markham ?
May 04 12:28:56 <patrickm>	alanm: he is... and it's a beautiful place 
May 04 12:53:53 <Highlander>	its not a castle or a palace.  They started building those in the past few years around here... but it does have a nice giant deck on it now :-)
May 04 12:55:28 <Highlander>	these are the palaces and castles...  https://goo.gl/photos/UDyJdFTsiZk31RJV7
May 04 12:55:41 <Highlander>	we are but a hovel
May 04 12:58:51 <patrickm>	Highlander: how many decks do you have?
May 04 13:17:27 <rgb>	is that how you rate palaces, like cupholders in SUVs and baby strollers?
May 04 13:26:38 <rgrunber>	either that or defense against giant rocks hurled by a trebuchet
May 04 13:31:26 <patrickm>	rgb: he has a partial mote
May 04 13:36:25 <patrickm>	ipun: new Kiva's was good, eggsalad was fresh and not too seasoned.. which means you can season to your taste... will go back
May 04 13:39:24 <Highlander>	just 2 decks if you count the little one off the master.    no wait.. there is a third one on the back of the garage
May 04 13:39:51 <Highlander>	i do not have a partial moat. 
May 04 13:40:27 <rgb>	patrickm: so that would be a really tiny speck of dust?  ;-)
May 04 13:40:51 <rgb>	Highlander: full moat!   :-D
May 04 13:42:16 <Highlander>	i suppose the pool covers about 2 degrees of approach, i dont think that counts as even partial :-)
May 04 13:48:25 <rgb>	heh
May 04 13:49:09 <patrickm>	Highlander: i was talking about the river
May 04 13:49:32 <Highlander>	ooooooo. thats a long ways away.  and still only covers the back :-)
May 04 13:50:03 <Highlander>	i suppose you could consider the cottage to have a full moat
May 04 13:50:03 <patrickm>	Highlander: right, hence partial!
May 04 13:50:42 <patrickm>	Highlander: oh, i didn't even think of your cottage/island
May 04 14:10:42 <ipun>	patrickm: nice thats good! My bagel was pretty good too, ill go back for a lox 
May 04 14:18:59 <rgb>	ok, by that metric, I have a half moat since the Rideau River is 15m from my front door.  :-)

May 19 09:37:10 <patrickm>	jwellman:  re: resolution, in general yes... but it becomes negligible as you move up due to equipment limitation... CDs are 16/44 but the new hotness, hi-def stuff is 24/192'ish... most recordings in the last decade are 24/44 or 24/48, then dropped down to 16 bit
May 19 09:37:16 <patrickm>	jwellman: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-resolution_audio
May 19 09:38:14 <patrickm>	so bit depth + sample rate... most folks can't hear the difference between 22/48 and 22/96 but can hear the difference between 24 and 16
May 19 09:40:01 <patrickm>	jwellman: i've heard this little guy, it's fun https://www.amazon.ca/Cambridge-Audio-DAC-DacMagic-Black/dp/B0078Q35PG
May 19 09:40:35 <jwellman>	most of my collection would be coming off CDs, I have a few SACD. 24/96 would probably be the right balance
May 19 09:41:33 <jwellman>	Ah, I've heard of this guy before.  Do you know any shops that can meet this price point or is amazon.ca the best bet?
May 19 09:43:36 <patrickm>	jwellman: executive audio [which used to be just south of eglinton / yonge is a cambridge distributor]... they moved though
May 19 09:44:40 <patrickm>	jwellman: hmmm executive stereo https://executivestereo.com/
May 19 09:45:19 <jwellman>	tks patrick
May 19 09:45:49 <patrickm>	jwellman: not a recommendation... but a suggestion
May 19 09:46:03 <stooke_>	I know I'll get laughed at (because the NAD of today is _not_ the NAD of yesteryear), but I use a D7050
May 19 09:46:24 <patrickm>	stooke_: yeah, but I do like NAD
May 19 09:47:34 <patrickm>	jwellman: i have this one, but that may be overkill -> http://bryston.com/products/digital_audio/BDA-3.html
May 19 09:48:20 <stooke_>	patrickm, do you colour the edges of your CDs green?
May 19 09:49:48 <patrickm>	jwellman: but i do have a spare BDA-1 dac if you want to give it a try https://www.stereophile.com/digitalprocessors/bryston_bda-1_da_converter
May 19 09:50:42 <patrickm>	stooke_: i don't have a cd player hooked up to my main system actually 
May 19 09:52:12 <patrickm>	jwellman: try as in "just to see if you need / want a DAC" before you drop money
May 19 09:52:14 <stooke_>	patrickm, I'm not surprised - I haven't for ages either.  I rip once to lossless, then put the CD away.
May 19 09:54:02 <jwellman>	patrickm - lets chat about the BDA-1 on Tuesday - I'd love to try a DAC before spending, but I wouldn't want to risk breaking anything of that caliber. 
May 19 09:54:29 <jwellman>	patrickm - you mentioned a simpler way to rip well? anything you can point me to on that front?
May 19 09:54:54 <patrickm>	jwellman: ripping of CDs or SACDs?
May 19 09:55:16 *	patrickm is obliged to state that ripping of SACDs is illegal and shouldn't be done
May 19 09:55:30 <jwellman>	….in that case, mainly CDs 
May 19 09:55:31 <jwellman>	:)
May 19 09:57:46 <patrickm>	for CDs i used to use EAC in secure mode or dBpoweramp but now i just use JRiver as it's my media software
May 19 09:59:27 <jwellman>	Any CD ripping hardware will suffice if used with Jriver?
May 19 10:00:17 <patrickm>	Jriver will rip it for you
May 19 10:00:40 <patrickm>	but i haven't ripped a cd in a looooooooooooong time
May 19 10:01:31 <stooke_>	I remember EAC! That take me back...
May 19 10:02:08 <patrickm>	jwellman: i still purchase music though... but mainly through outlets such as http://www.prostudiomasters.com/ 
May 19 10:19:18 <patrickm>	lberk: received notification that Monday/Tuesday have sold out... Wednesday is the only open date
May 19 10:19:51 <dcheung>	7 seats remaining on wed when I registered 30 minutes ago
May 19 10:21:37 <lberk>	patrickm: thanks, will pass that along
May 19 10:21:55 <steveg>	it'll be fuunnnn
May 19 10:23:04 <patrickm>	dcheung: steveg registered for wednesday so i immediately registered for that day too!
May 19 10:23:36 <rgrunber>	a full day with steveg ..
May 19 10:23:43 <dcheung>	<3
May 19 11:50:25 *	rgb still is a bryston fan, 35 years later.  :-)
May 19 13:04:36 <steveg>	rgrunber, you're welcome
May 19 13:06:21 <rgrunber>	shouldn't the wednesday group be the judge of that :P
May 19 13:07:02 <rgrunber>	just yesterday you were trying to get lberk to build you a wall.. not just any wall.. a hyperwall
May 19 13:10:23 <steveg>	rgrunber, are you telling me if you had the opportunity to get lberk to build you a hyperwall you would say no?
May 19 13:14:03 <rgrunber>	tough call.. honestly. i have one monitor, never gone with 2.. but would i explicitly tell him to stop building the well.. hmm
May 19 13:14:18 <rgrunber>	wall*
May 19 15:57:59 <patrickm>	lberk: to continue with our discussion yesterday, this *should* be on my desk -> https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00LYHXGM2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
May 19 15:58:17 <patrickm>	lberk: unless someone stole it at reception
May 19 15:58:17 <lberk>	oh nice!
May 19 15:59:37 <lberk>	actually, that's one album I haven't yet listened to at 24/96 ... time to throw that on
May 19 16:00:15 <dcheung>	patrickm: I put it on your desk
May 19 16:00:17 <patrickm>	lberk: nice, i'm on Orion at the moment... 24/96
May 19 16:00:48 <patrickm>	dcheung: thanks... you're my favourite JBoss'ian
May 19 16:07:53 <amisevsk>	aren't vinyl recordings the equivalent of 10 bit or something?
May 19 16:08:45 <lberk>	amisevsk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3xFmN8sYig 
May 19 16:09:38 <amisevsk>	now this is what i call music!
May 19 16:10:05 <amisevsk>	this is actually pretty good
May 19 16:11:42 <patrickm>	hmmm... the 8bit Orion sounds like Kraftwerk
May 19 16:14:00 <patrickm>	amisevsk: something around there... iirc, 8 track was about 1/2 that
May 19 16:14:31 <amisevsk>	patrickm: oh well, I've never owned quality enough audio equipment for it to make a difference :)
May 19 16:15:20 <jwellman>	let me get this straight, patrickm: which is your money on: vinyl or FLAC?
May 19 16:16:28 <dcheung>	mp3 for life!
May 19 16:16:57 <patrickm>	jwellman: why not both!
May 19 16:17:15 <patrickm>	jwellman: this is my vinyl collection at the moment -> https://www.discogs.com/user/scott_blackula/collection?page=1&sort=artist%2Casc&folder=0&limit=250&sort_order=asc&layout=big
May 19 16:18:51 <jwellman>	Right now I run about 50:50 vinyl:CD. I'm just trying to deduce whether ripping and FLAC are going to give better sound or just better music library management….
May 19 16:19:23 <jwellman>	…..yeah, thats a good amout of vinyl *gulp*
May 19 16:20:18 <amisevsk>	jwellman: starting down a dark path. I used to try to rip all my cds to FLAC, before giving up and being happy with LAME V2 mp3s
May 19 16:20:25 <patrickm>	jwellman: i have [apparently, according to JRiver] 11,566 CDs or higher level rips
May 19 16:20:50 <jwellman>	which is  your favourite :)
May 19 16:21:42 <patrickm>	jwellman: ;) the funny things is, you can take a look at the vinyl collection and look for the duplicates/triplicates/etc
May 19 16:22:26 <patrickm>	jwellman: i like them both, digital is easier, vinyl is more of an experience
May 19 16:22:30 <jwellman>	I was noticing that. Are you researching/hunting each pressing or just buying when you come across them?
May 19 16:22:44 <patrickm>	jwellman: plus it's a different transport 
May 19 16:22:56 <patrickm>	jwellman: i hunt for specific pressings
May 19 16:23:52 <jwellman>	Mostly online or do you frequent places like Sonic Boom etc?
May 19 16:24:52 <patrickm>	online most of the time... elusivedisc, ebay [most of the time]... sealed only though
May 19 16:25:09 <patrickm>	jwellman: they don't have to be "audiophile" pressings either
May 19 16:26:16 <patrickm>	jwellman: i purchased a sealed regular pressing of Frampton Comes Alive last month... pressed in 1976 [although you can get a new remastered to vinyl version at Sunrise]
May 19 16:27:28 <patrickm>	jwellman: invest in http://vinylflat.com/vinylflatproducts.html
May 19 16:27:42 <patrickm>	it works
May 19 16:37:30 <lberk>	was there a particular pressing of Nick Drake's stuff you'd recommend?
May 19 16:37:45 <lberk>	or is his stuff on psm?
May 19 16:38:23 <patrickm>	lberk: i have a recent pressing because I couldn't find this stuff in good condition
May 19 16:39:17 <patrickm>	lberk: i have 3 albums in hi def digital as well... if you want them... Five Leaves Left++
May 19 16:39:57 <lberk>	actually, psm seems to have it, but thanks for the offer
May 19 16:40:29 <patrickm>	lberk: metallica and nick drake make strange bedfellows 
May 19 16:40:41 <patrickm>	but they're both great
May 19 16:41:01 <lberk>	heh, ya, not typically on the same playlist
May 19 16:43:00 <patrickm>	lberk: i picked up the nick drake files from HDtracks when they had a sale
May 19 16:43:41 <lberk>	ah I always forget to check them, thanks
May 19 17:04:52 <patrickm>	lberk: thanks for bringing up nick drake... just listened to "Day is Done", good way to end the week ;)

May 23 13:12:49 *	alanm wonders if that 'spoon' is about the size of a large farming implement
May 23 13:21:09 *	steveg is going to have to keep coming in this week until icecream appears

May 24 12:09:19 *	rgb pickles freshly-foraged ramps
May 24 15:40:54 <patrickm>	PSA: I just sent out the 2016-2017 Canadian Government SR&ED requests... good times
May 24 15:41:36 <patrickm>	jlebon: ^^^ i'm crafting a note to the folks that own a project that hasn't been claimed yet... you're on the list ;)
May 24 15:42:03 <patrickm>	jlebon: please control your excitement 
May 24 15:42:32 <omajid_wfh>	we definitely dont want the excitement to overflow and wrap around
May 24 15:43:33 <jlebon>	patrickm: ouhhh goody! it's like christmas again! :)
May 24 16:00:55 <rgrunber>	it feels like just yesterday i was looking through status reports compiling a list of projects.. good times
May 24 16:01:10 <rgrunber>	for 2015-2016

May 24 17:01:42 <dcheung>	we need this
May 25 11:48:49 <pwouters>	does everyone get a hockey puck, or only canadian redhatters ? :)
May 25 11:48:57 *	pwouters got one in the mail yesterday :)
May 25 11:49:19 <lisac>	I believe they still go out to everyone in the company
May 25 11:51:24 <pwouters>	:)
May 25 11:51:40 <steveg>	they make excellent coasters
May 25 11:56:36 <rgrunber>	i figured it's still a global company thing..
May 25 12:33:28 <ipun>	lisac: are interns part of the "everyone"
May 25 12:33:47 <lisac>	ipun...as in receiving a puck?
May 25 12:33:52 <ipun>	urd
May 25 12:33:54 <ipun>	yes*
May 25 12:34:20 <lisac>	first one comes at 5 years...not sure you can stay as an intern that long...questions may be asked?
May 25 12:35:36 <ipun>	hahahah yeah definitely not 
May 25 12:43:16 <alanm>	they materialize in increments of 5 years 
May 25 12:53:22 <dcheung>	pwouters: congrats on your 5 or 10 or 15 years at redhat!!!
May 25 12:54:21 <alanm>	haha

May 25 12:56:12 <alanm>	there other two are a drawer somewhere 
May 25 12:56:13 <lisac>	alanm, I have a hard time convincing people you actually exist...
May 25 12:56:21 <alanm>	lol
May 25 12:56:45 <lisac>	alanm, very few have actually ever seen you 
May 25 12:56:59 <alanm>	True.. not since Jim Lemke
May 25 12:57:26 <lisac>	alanm, i think he has retired now...
May 25 12:58:02 <alanm>	btw, I'm looking for a decent landscape architect
May 25 12:58:53 <lisac>	alanm, you have given up on gardening?
May 25 13:01:06 <alanm>	The front needs to be cleaned out totally, the shrubs are over 30 years old 
May 25 13:02:36 <alanm>	The back needs to be properly planned out. I've got to call an arborist to get the trees in the back properly thinned out 
May 25 13:03:06 <lisac>	alanm, sorry i don't know of anyone
May 25 13:03:57 <alanm>	The trees in the back are part of a designated heritage forest by the city so they're protected.
May 25 13:05:14 <alanm>	This part of the  Rouge valley area is Carolinian forest 
May 25 13:06:27 <alanm>	We have to find plant species that aren't going to be eaten by our resident groundhog (Sonic) and the rabbits and the deer that come in the back to graze every now and then.
May 25 13:10:45 <alanm>	lisac: https://goo.gl/photos/ywda3sKYmwe5kWBu6

May 25 14:19:32 <ipun>	thank you to hwoever gave me that hockey puck :)
May 25 14:34:39 <patrickm>	lisac: carpet cleaning++...  good timing really, dcheung came by my office today and made me spill oatmeal on the floor [at least that's my excuse]
May 25 14:35:56 <dcheung>	and it was really good oatmeal too
May 25 14:37:39 <rgrunber>	there's really good oatmeal?
May 25 14:44:07 <steveg>	looks like a hydro vault caught fire down the road
May 25 14:44:16 <steveg>	eglinton is closed (even more closed than usual! :P)
May 25 14:44:49 <yzhang>	steveg seems too happy about it
May 25 14:45:20 <patrickm>	steveg: east or west of the office?
May 25 14:46:13 <lisac>	*maybe that is why ISAAC called me to see if we had lost power....apparently there are 11. 000 without power somewhere around here
May 25 14:47:11 <patrickm>	http://www.torontohydro.com/sites/electricsystem/poweroutages/pages/outagemap.aspx
May 25 14:48:33 <steveg>	patrickm, west - closer to the intersection
May 25 14:48:55 <patrickm>	steveg: boooo.. and not boooo-urns 
May 25 14:48:57 <steveg>	patrickm, there are two firetrucks blocking the street between just past the second cup and yonge st itself
May 25 14:49:26 <steveg>	patrickm, i dont know what vault the building is actually in because even the buildings right there seemed to have power
May 25 14:49:29 <ltulloch_>	we can still access the subway @ eglinton station, right?
May 25 14:49:29 *	steveg shrugs

May 25 14:57:55 <alanm>	ugh.. skunks... Haven't seen too many of them .. yet.
May 25 15:00:12 <rgb>	I don't mind 'em.  it is the squirrels that are driving me bonkers...  chewing solar panel wires and denuding the top storey of my front cedar
May 25 15:00:47 <dcheung>	are they driving you nuts?
May 25 15:02:47 <alanm>	there are times I'd swear that they were having a convention next door to us.
May 25 15:04:27 <alanm>	the problem with the deer around here is that the ticks they carry have tested positive for Lyme disease
May 25 15:05:56 <rgrunber>	dcheung: seriously that comment actually had me checking if i had ops to kick you.. and i'm the king of corny jokes.
May 25 15:07:45 <rgrunber>	you might even say i'm the colonel of corny jokes.. boom.

May 25 15:09:29 <rgrunber>	it was well (horribly) deserved.
May 25 15:09:58 <lberk>	yzhang: you mean you're going to start kicking yourself?
May 25 15:10:27 <yzhang>	lberk: I'm not csanting I don't do bad puns
May 25 15:15:15 <csanting>	Im trying to kick that habit
May 25 15:17:30 <yzhang>	4.5/10 no real context
May 25 15:38:02 *	rgb comes from a family of punsters, so welcomes them.  :)
May 25 15:40:24 <ipun>	i heard my (sur)name
May 25 15:40:29 <rgb>	hung, drawn and quoted?
May 26 09:33:54 <pabelanger>	Greetings, looking at mojo page for toronto office, but some links for hotels are not working. Is there a preferred hotel that is close to the office?
May 26 09:34:16 <pabelanger>	I'll be coming up for a 2 day for some training in a few weeks
May 26 09:35:51 <lberk>	pabelanger: Best Western is just around the corner from the office; 808 Mt Pleasant Rd, Toronto, ON M4P 2L2
May 26 09:37:10 <pabelanger>	lberk: thanks, I'll look into that
May 26 09:47:50 <mwringe>	pabelanger: are you flying in or driving?
May 26 09:49:02 <pabelanger>	mwringe: train
May 26 09:49:09 <pabelanger>	coming down from Ottawa
May 26 09:52:15 <mwringe>	pabelanger: ah, ok, I just going to mention that Toronto is a very pedestrian and public transit friendly city. I don't know if you are planning to rent a car, but it might be easier to just get around on the subway (the train station has an adjacent subway stop and the office is on the same line)
May 26 09:53:41 <pabelanger>	mwringe: Ya, was planning on getting subway from Union station. Office looks to be a straight north
May 26 09:54:47 <steveg>	lisac, will we having icecream to celebrate pabelanger's arrival?
May 26 09:54:52 <steveg>	*we be
May 26 09:55:36 <lisac>	steveg, was thinking of ordering pizza for the manulife presentation...does that work?
May 26 09:57:19 <alanm>	really healthy.. especially with double cheese 
May 26 10:05:40 <mwringe>	pabelanger: yep, that would be my recommendation for how to get here
May 26 10:13:29 <patrickm>	alanm: will double cheese get you to the office... or do we need cheese filled crust too?
May 26 10:14:00 <alanm>	haha
May 26 11:16:41 <dsoukhov>	does anyone know the guest wifi password?

May 26 12:52:29 <rgb>	dang, completely forgot about the manulife meeting...
May 26 13:11:15 <yzhang>	rgb: you didn't miss much, or is there something specific you wanted to ask?
May 26 13:11:22 <yzhang>	Otherwise it was pretty much the same as last time
May 26 13:11:36 <yzhang>	A tutorial on how to use the website and mobile app.
May 26 13:13:10 <rgb>	I didn't see the last time.  I have no mobile.  I've been waiting until the kinks got ironed out by all the other eager beavers...

May 29 09:12:56 <yzhang>	also dcheung: I think he goes by zmhassan
May 29 09:13:12 <dcheung>	yzhang: gotcha
May 29 09:15:21 <patrickm>	now that's a nick you don't see too often: thauser|gettingmarried^^ 
May 29 10:14:43 <dcheung>	patrickm: 2 packages arrived for you
May 29 10:16:50 <rgrunber>	50 emails in inbox.. all from pnt-jira.. oh yeah
May 29 10:16:56 <rgrunber>	(among others)
May 29 10:17:10 <patrickm>	dcheung: niiiiiiiiiiice, thanks!... similar size packages?
May 29 10:17:24 <rgrunber>	let's play the how far in is the first 'please stop replying' message
May 29 10:17:39 <rgrunber>	oo, 2nd message
May 29 10:17:55 <dcheung>	patrickm: one slightly bigger than the other one
May 29 10:18:06 <dcheung>	and one had an attempted 1st delivery of May 27
May 29 10:18:11 <patrickm>	ohhh... i like mystery!
May 29 10:18:34 <ericwill>	rgrunber I unsubscribed immediately having been reminded of the QUARTER END PUSH fiasco from last year
May 29 10:18:58 <rgrunber>	i intend to read each and every single one... just not yet..
May 29 11:23:11 <rgb>	rgrunber: not, me, I unsubscribed...  and was told that my subscription was tied to my jira account.  WTH?  David acknowledged a number of problems with the way this was executed...
May 29 11:26:15 <fche>	rgb, there was an indication that we were auto-signed-up this time, and that this may reoccur in the future
May 29 11:28:22 <steveg>	yes it seems likely it is on some kind of automatic sync on a regular basis
May 29 11:28:29 <steveg>	so unsubscribing is only a temporary reprieve
May 29 11:28:57 <fche>	and thus the annoying-them-back-with "unsubscribe me" seems not entirely disproportional
May 29 11:29:04 <mjw>	yeah, that one was weird. I was sure I unsubscribed last time a flood of jira-foo-bar stuff hit my inbox and did again now. Will see if it reappears.
May 29 11:31:25 <rgb>	David referred me to a posting on may 2nd that explained the reasoning...  only, I never got that, and wonder how many others annoyed by this didn't either.
May 29 11:33:26 <steveg>	i can kind of understand them wanting an announcement list for all jira users
May 29 11:33:37 <steveg>	but it probably shouldnt be set so that anyone can respond and you cant unsub
May 29 11:37:37 <mjw>	and it probably shouldn't include people who aren't really jira users but just added to some jira ticket by someone else
May 29 11:45:43 <rgb>	and they should probably have another list for the jira admins
May 29 11:47:49 <rgrunber>	steveg: well if the new announcement list guidelines get pushed through, you will not be able to unsubscribe from a *-announce list to which you are registred by default no ?.. but at least the reply-all hell won't happen.
May 29 11:47:54 <rgrunber>	so.. close enough i guess.
May 29 11:51:59 <rgb>	rgrunber: I'm fine with that as long at the list of approved posters is short and vetted.
May 29 11:52:15 <steveg>	thats a little different though rgrunber 
May 29 11:52:26 <steveg>	in that the proposal is only for 4 geo-specific announce lists iirc
May 29 11:52:46 <steveg>	wouldnt necessarily apply to this kind of one...
May 29 12:02:30 <rgrunber>	steveg: really?.. hmm 
May 29 12:04:25 <rgrunber>	steveg: to me it doesn't seem like they're saying it only applies to geo-specific locations.. i think they're just using the geo-specific ones as examples.
May 29 12:04:49 <rgrunber>	https://mojo.redhat.com/projects/email-list-improvement-project/pages/large-group-list-proposal
May 29 12:05:25 <rgrunber>	s/locations/lists
May 29 12:25:32 <steveg>	rgrunber, not quite
May 29 12:25:52 <steveg>	rgrunber, they are included in "formal lists" as a specific type of announce list that will be based on region or employee type
May 29 12:26:04 <steveg>	rgrunber, using jira is not a region or employee type
May 29 12:26:26 <steveg>	rgrunber, on the other side the various region lists (e.g. canada list) are used as examples of open lists
May 29 12:26:32 <steveg>	rgrunber, those are basically as they are today
May 29 12:26:43 <steveg>	(under the proposal)
May 29 12:27:12 <rgrunber>	employee type is what's vague for me.. certainly users of jira could fall under things like devtools.. since a lot of the sprint planning is done on there, as an example.
May 29 17:16:30 <rgb>	I'm *still* getting stuff from that pnt-jira thread even though I'm unsubscribed from the list...
May 30 16:01:12 <steveg>	http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/05/30/giant-rubber-duck-toronto_n_16882646.html
May 30 16:01:24 <steveg>	i for one welcome our new rubber duck overlord
May 30 16:07:16 <rgb>	cluster loon doesn't have quite the same ring...
May 30 16:08:55 <omajid_wfh>	$120,000... oh my.
May 30 16:36:14 <rgrunber>	steveg: you always welcome our overlords! I want to take a chance and be mean to them.
May 30 16:39:11 <steveg>	yeah im a sucker for a new overlord
May 30 18:16:53 <fche>	for those who run workstations that use NIS for the passwd/group databases, they can now direct them to tofan.yyz
May 30 18:17:11 <fche>	   #  echo domain redhat.com server tofan.yyz.redhat.com   > /dev/yp.conf
May 30 18:17:27 <fche>	it now gets updates from ldap, unlike the IT server over in RDU(?)
May 30 18:23:15 <omajid_away>	fche: do you still maintain the setup instructions on intranet? (is it mojo now?) could you add them there?
May 30 18:23:27 <fche>	will try, yeah
May 30 18:23:40 <omajid_away>	thanks!
May 30 18:29:10 <fche>	https://home.corp.redhat.com/wiki/toronto-machine-setup  <-- still exists, has lots of obsolete bits, edit at will!

May 31 11:03:08 <rgrunber>	it used to be just 'lisac'
May 31 11:03:11 <jkang>	;p
May 31 11:22:11 <patrickm>	lisac: for the OpenShift training next week, we may need a few laptops for folks that don't have laptaps... are there a handful of machines that we can commandeer for Mon->Wed?
May 31 11:22:28 <yzhang>	patrickm: we have intern 1,3,4,5,6,7
May 31 11:22:32 <yzhang>	so 6 laptops on f25
May 31 11:22:44 <patrickm>	hmmmm
May 31 11:22:48 <yzhang>	er well maybe I should update them beforehand
May 31 11:23:17 <lisac>	patrickm, will the intern machines work?
May 31 11:23:19 <patrickm>	6 is good, we'll need to take a poll to see if that is enough
May 31 11:23:28 <patrickm>	lisac: absolutely
May 31 11:23:43 <yzhang>	dibs intern3
May 31 11:24:08 <jkang>	yzhang, what day are you doing training?
May 31 11:24:20 *	yzhang checks
May 31 11:25:33 <yzhang>	jkang: monday
May 31 11:25:47 <csanting>	dibs personal laptop
May 31 11:26:08 <yzhang>	patrickm: does the machines need anything specific? I can set them up beforehand
May 31 11:27:10 <patrickm>	yzhang: you should have received a note from marizol... but in the interest of time:
May 31 11:27:14 <yzhang>	nvm only a browser is needed
May 31 11:27:15 <patrickm>	1) Bring a laptop that gives you access to a browser. It could be running any Linux distro (Fedora, CSB, RHEL, etc...), MacOS, or even Windows =-o ;-).
May 31 11:27:15 <patrickm>	2) If you don't already have one, please create a github account prior to the class.
May 31 11:27:24 <yzhang>	Yep, thanks patrickm
May 31 11:28:19 <patrickm>	although your choice of OS could be publicly mocked... choose wisely 
May 31 11:29:37 *	dcheung buys a macbook pro for the openshift training
May 31 11:37:29 <steveg>	patrickm, i have two spares i can set up with a basic desktop if needed
May 31 11:41:59 <csanting>	is anyone familiar with adding rh vpn on android?
May 31 11:52:12 <patrickm>	steveg: thanks for the offer, i think we should be good
May 31 12:06:00 <rgb>	csanting: yes, hint: don't let it save your password or you'll get locked out of your token...
May 31 12:06:46 <patrickm>	lisac: remember to get a few loaves of bread + some peanut butter and jam for lunches next week 
May 31 12:07:18 <alanm>	loaves and fishes ? :-D
May 31 12:08:57 <patrickm>	alanm: close... loaves and Jif... building communities and friendships since 1957
May 31 12:09:12 *	rgb looks at his 4.1kg pail of crunchy PB that just arrived from Toronto yesterday...  (ONFC)
May 31 12:09:53 <lisac>	patrickm, if i don't get your credit card that might be all you get:-)
May 31 12:12:12 <alanm>	that's true.. Skippy hasn't been around for ages... My grandfather was a big fan of Skippy
May 31 12:12:57 <patrickm>	lisac: honestly, a free peanut butter and jam sandwich is perfectly fine for me
May 31 12:13:06 <alanm>	with bananas 
May 31 12:14:10 <patrickm>	... but others may have a different opinion [they're wrong of course, but they have a right to their wrong opinion]
May 31 12:16:14 <alanm>	that's a polite way of saying "Opinions are like a***oles. Everybody's got one but nobody wants to look at the other guy's" 
May 31 12:16:47 <patrickm>	alanm: that's an odd way of putting it... but that's just my opinion ;)
May 31 12:17:05 <alanm>	haha
May 31 12:21:29 <rgb>	why do you need any sweetener with skippy?  there's so much icing sugar in it it crunches under your teeth...
May 31 12:22:30 <rgb>	alanm: I'd heard that one as "nobody wants to *hear* the other guy's"  ;-)
May 31 12:22:46 <alanm>	that too
May 31 12:23:07 <rgb>	isn't that a dirty harry line?
May 31 12:24:41 *	alanm looks.. yeah but it looks like it's origins are from somewhere else
May 31 12:25:23 <rgb>	quite possible...

May 31 12:25:53 <alanm>	remember fortune(6) ?
May 31 12:27:57 <rgb>	alanm: sounds like "look at" is the canonical one...
May 31 12:28:10 <alanm>	yeah
May 31 12:29:25 <rgb>	I had my login script give me a random definition from the jargon file for a long time...  that was edifying.
May 31 12:31:09 <alanm>	I think I first saw that one on BSD 4.1 on a Vax
May 31 12:31:25 <alanm>	It might have been in V7 Unix but I don't think so.
May 31 12:51:48 <rgb>	I may have been first running it on ultrix around 1990...
May 31 13:48:13 <csanting>	rgb, thanks
May 31 13:48:25 <csanting>	did you use any certificates? or just manually enter the details
May 31 13:54:25 <csanting>	ah, nevermind, I found a recent mojo article which has some other info I was looking for as well
May 31 17:33:29 <patrickm>	boooo... i was hoping LG would have a singularly awesome sign off on irc today!

Jun 01 10:08:11 <fnasser>	Anyone here know how to claim a lab exam in Manulife?  It was trivial to do in the Grewt-West site.

Jun 13 09:24:07 <mrobson>	mrobson no, I haven't done anything there yet - I have CF running with my Openshift instance, but I haven't tested the TP monitoring for EAP yet 
Jun 13 09:27:46 <efraim>	mrobson, ok thx... it seems there was a doc update and something got remove and I wanted to understand more... let me contact Content Services
Jun 13 09:28:25 <mrobson>	efraim ah.. well it's a tech preview feature for EAP so maybe it was removed on purpose.. 
Jun 13 09:29:10 <efraim>	yes, understood ;)

Jun 15 14:50:36 <ltulloch>	woah
Jun 15 14:58:00 <steveg>	are we having icecream to celebrate the great netsplit of 2017?
Jun 15 14:58:07 <steveg>	asking for a friend
Jun 15 14:59:11 <lisac>	steveg, the friend can make it any time they wish:-)
Jun 15 14:59:43 <steveg>	damn that's...cold
Jun 15 14:59:45 *	steveg ducks
Jun 15 15:00:08 <lisac>	steveg, just like ice cream
Jun 15 15:01:37 <rgb>	heh
Jun 15 15:02:21 <amerey>	lisac++
Jun 15 16:04:21 <ltulloch>	lisac++
Jun 16 13:39:27 <steveg>	against my better judgment, who here is an avid ts24 user?
Jun 16 13:39:49 <steveg>	do you login at https://atgtravel.com/portal/redhat24/  or https://www.concursolutions.com/ ?
Jun 16 13:39:57 <steveg>	i have always used the former and selected canada without issue
Jun 16 13:40:13 <steveg>	there is now an issue with my account, and their support are trying to tell me i should use the latter link
Jun 16 13:40:34 <steveg>	even though the issue is not related to login (i can login on the former) but actually booking travel (which results in an error)
Jun 16 13:56:45 <rgrunber>	steveg: i get 500 when i try to click the former link..
Jun 16 13:57:03 <rgrunber>	according to https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-16375, it points to the redhat24 one..
Jun 16 14:01:11 <steveg>	rgrunber, yeah it throwing a 500 started more recently - e.g. last 30 mins or so
Jun 16 14:01:31 <steveg>	the support people our travel@redhat.com folks redirected my query to claim "We took over the Canadian employees  portion of the online bookings this past year 
Jun 16 14:01:31 <steveg>	I have sent the issue to second level support.  As soon as we have a reply we will let you know 
Jun 16 14:01:31 <steveg>	Thank you."
Jun 16 14:05:18 <steveg>	this seems like a lot of hoops to jump through to regain access to a provider we're dropping anyway but ho hum
Jun 16 14:12:10 <steveg>	rofl
Jun 16 14:12:36 <steveg>	rgrunber, 95% sure it was down to reboot their coldfusion app to put the maintainence warning up for an *upcoming* maintenance outage lol
Jun 16 14:12:53 <rgrunber>	yeah i saw it now..
Jun 16 14:13:33 <rgrunber>	tbh i don't really use it that often.. barely remember my credentials.. i need my employee id?! really.. bah
Jun 16 14:14:36 <rgrunber>	i could try logging in one sec.. for a sec i thought i'd have to book a trip to get the error...
Jun 16 14:18:54 <rgrunber>	bah.. might be a while fishing out my old credentials (the password mainly).. so if anyone wants to try it out, feel free..
Jun 16 14:19:40 <steveg>	rgrunber, to get the error i was originally complaining about you would have to search for one but at this point i cant get that far anymore lol
Jun 16 14:19:46 <steveg>	rgrunber, they have "fixed" my account
Jun 16 14:20:32 <rgrunber>	so it's all good now.. or you can't get that far..
Jun 16 14:20:54 <steveg>	yeah, problem solved - will never use it again
Jun 16 14:21:01 <rgrunber>	bahaha
Jun 16 14:21:33 <rgrunber>	it's a good strategy for figuring out who's still using some legacy app/link..
Jun 16 14:30:14 <rgrunber>	ok weird.. now i'm seeing it's unavailable.. for like an hour, but was up like 5min ago.
Jun 16 15:32:03 <jjohnstn|wfh>	rgrunber: how do I connect to the docker daemon on Windows?  I notice in the Docker General settings there is an option to allow tcp://localhost:2375...is that how you do your testing?
Jun 16 15:37:50 <jjohnstn|wfh>	rgrunber: that setting worked
Jun 16 15:38:20 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn|wfh: yes, it should be enabled though.. and the daemon should start automatically
Jun 16 15:52:07 <jjohnstn|wfh>	rgrunber: it wasn't, but it is now :)
Jun 16 15:52:25 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn|wfh: hmm maybe it's user specific.. but i thought the daemon is the same for everyone.
Jun 16 16:06:11 <rgrunber>	steveg: the 2-3pm outage is now a 2-5pm outage. i guess things are going well.

Jun 26 10:32:31 <rgrunber>	steveg: in the past however, we were able to dismantle the tables and move them into the closet..
Jun 26 10:32:53 <rgrunber>	steveg: more recently (as of the remodel) i don't think the tables can be easily dismantled..
Jun 26 10:33:56 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, hey
Jun 26 10:34:31 <lufimtse>	JUG? steveg

Jun 26 10:35:25 <steveg>	lufimtse, JUG = Java Users Group, Jug = what you drink beer in after a JUG
Jun 26 10:35:35 <lufimtse>	steveg, +1 to your definition. 
Jun 26 10:35:56 <lufimtse>	steveg, I think we can host such a meeting
Jun 26 10:37:09 <steveg>	i've had the openstack group there before but that was pre-reno

Jul 13 09:22:52 <steveg>	dcheung, there is but we will change it's behavior at random based on the cake backend in use
Jul 13 11:24:28 <patrickm>	steveg: more importantly, thank you for donating the left over beer ;)
Jul 13 11:27:18 <steveg>	patrickm, just one man trying to make a difference
Jul 13 11:27:43 <steveg>	patrickm, i actually think that is the one area of the catering where the guy who organized it might have under done it if we had actually gotten 25
Jul 13 15:11:55 <mbenitez>	almost time to update: https://home.corp.redhat.com/wiki/torontointernlineage
Jul 13 15:58:36 <jkang>	that intern list reminds me of the good old days... :) hahah
Jul 13 16:05:58 <lisac>	I think the dates are off a bit. I have Faisal as our first intern....2000-2001 followed by Alan Woo. They were not here together?
Jul 13 16:09:47 <jkang>	lisac, I'm not sure how to edit it atm but I'd be happy to fix any discrepancies if you'd like to give me a list of them!
Jul 13 16:10:38 <lisac>	will do jie
Jul 13 16:12:54 <ltulloch>	jkang++
Jul 13 16:20:23 <rubao>	jkang++
Jul 13 16:33:19 <patrickm>	lisac: faisal was alone the first year... and I thought it was 1999
Jul 13 16:34:40 <lisac>	patrickm, maybe?
Jul 13 16:34:53 <lisac>	I just know he was her by himself
Jul 13 16:34:57 <lisac>	here
Jul 13 16:36:48 <yobshans_>	openstack
Jul 13 16:37:19 <patrickm>	lisac: my pre-2002 email perished in the great fire of 2002 [oddly enough]
Jul 13 16:42:03 <lisac>	ahhh...found his file:-) Faisal started May 3, 1999 and ended January 4, 2000

Jul 19 11:18:38 <dmsimard>	steveg: how's the screen on that new laptop of yours ? I like to work outside during the summer and the sun likes to remind me that the brightness on my laptop sucks
Jul 19 11:19:02 <steveg>	dmsimard, i honestly dont know yet - like i said still using my previous one till i set it up
Jul 19 11:19:17 <dmsimard>	bummer
Jul 19 11:19:20 <dcheung>	dmsimard: are you interested in the t470s or x270?
Jul 19 11:19:25 <steveg>	dmsimard, currently i have an x240 but it's my personal machine so it has the touch screen - that wasnt an option for the RHT x270
Jul 19 11:19:51 <dmsimard>	dcheung: I would tend to go for the larger screen real estate (so t470), I,m sporting a w541 right now.
Jul 19 11:20:30 <dmsimard>	but my refresh isn't due for a while still anyway so mostly just contemplating what I'm missing out on :p
Jul 19 11:20:54 <dcheung>	dmsimard: I'll test it at noon. I have the t470s. but the 1080 screen does have low nit screen :( 
Jul 19 11:20:57 <dcheung>	https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470s-What-is-the-best-display-option.223460.0.html
Jul 19 11:21:09 <dcheung>	if you're going for t470, don't get the TN display!!!
Jul 19 11:22:57 <dmsimard>	TN ? /me looks
Jul 19 11:23:26 <dmsimard>	wow that review is super in-depth lol
Jul 19 11:23:43 <dcheung>	yeah notebookcheck does  really technical reviews, even checks for pwm
Jul 19 11:24:04 <dmsimard>	so higher nits is brighter, yeah ?
Jul 19 11:24:08 <dcheung>	dmsimard: yup
Jul 19 11:24:36 <dmsimard>	Hm, do we get to choose, though ? It's provided by Red Hat ?
Jul 19 11:24:52 <dmsimard>	I had my first laptop sent to me from Toronto so didn't really get to be picky on the specific SKU
Jul 19 11:24:59 <dcheung>	if it's provided by RH, I don't think you can choose which screen you'll get for a particular model
Jul 19 11:25:13 <dmsimard>	yeah..
Jul 19 11:25:20 <dmsimard>	do some people get theirs expensed instead ?
Jul 19 11:25:52 <dmsimard>	gotta admit the 14" 2560x1440 display looks dope
Jul 19 11:26:35 <dcheung>	sadly on the screen side, macbook pros are still king in terms of brightness and srgb %
Jul 19 11:27:33 <steveg>	dmsimard, not sure that people expense for that - i think you have to choose one of the RH bases
Jul 19 11:27:43 <dmsimard>	steveg: yeah that's what I thought too
Jul 19 11:27:45 <steveg>	dmsimard, folks do however expense ram/hdd if their manager is ok with it
Jul 19 11:28:12 <steveg>	dmsimard, because in my experience CDW the approved reseller often doesnt actually have the RAM upgrades for all of the laptops RH provides...
Jul 19 11:28:35 <dmsimard>	dcheung: macbooks are so darn expensive though, and tends to not play nice with linux distros still (usually power/heat)
Jul 19 11:29:29 <dcheung>	dmsimard: yup :( if only lenovos would put nice screens on their thinkpads. I heard the wqhds on x1 carbons are on par with macbook pros, but lenovo seems to be having manufacturing issues with it
Jul 19 11:29:51 <dmsimard>	dcheung: x1 carbons are too small for me :D
Jul 19 11:30:08 <dmsimard>	had a macbook air at $oldjob, never again
Jul 19 11:30:08 <dcheung>	it's 14" though
Jul 19 11:30:09 <rgrunber>	https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1075120
Jul 19 11:30:50 <dmsimard>	dcheung: oh I thought x1's were smaller than that

Jul 20 10:50:48 <jkang>	it's a little depressing needing to turn on lights at 10-11 AM in July

Aug 03 15:56:05 <alanm>	patience Grasshopper
Aug 03 15:56:34 <cchianel>	Then buy bananas in a way such that as soon as the yellows are done, the greens turn yellow\
Aug 03 15:56:46 <cchianel>	Then you can just buy greens
Aug 03 15:57:03 <cchianel>	Or you could dye the bananas yellow
Aug 03 15:57:11 <patrickm>	cchianel: sounds like a reasonable plan... talk to lisac_ about implementing it
Aug 03 15:57:40 <ericwill>	I suspect cchianel  will be "volunteering"  for this task soon
Aug 03 15:58:02 <alanm>	buy a bunch of these https://www.amazon.ca/Yellow-Banana-Protector-Camping-School/dp/B0094AJC5G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1501790209&sr=8-2&keywords=banana+case put them on a bandolier at home, stuff your bananas in them and THEN come to work
Aug 03 15:58:08 <patrickm>	alanm: speaking of time... when will we see your smiling face in the office?   i'll make sure there is plenty of tap water, no name tea and green bananas for you
Aug 03 15:58:27 <alanm>	ugh.. green bananas are enough to keep me away

Aug 03 15:59:28 <patrickm>	alanm: i have one of those!

Aug 03 16:00:40 <ericwill>	from the amazon page: "It is very suit for your children as it is shaped as a banana"

Aug 03 16:02:12 <alanm>	hmm.. the staircase as well... 40 steps .. all covered in algae .. getting a mite slick in the rain.
Aug 03 16:03:07 <lisac_>	alanm, I guess that's a no...
Aug 03 16:04:06 <alanm>	while I'm up there, you can remind Josh to keep cleaning his room.

Aug 10 10:47:22 <lufimtse_>	clessard, I've had to deal with some stuff related to that.
Aug 10 10:52:22 <clessard>	lufimtse_: thanks for the reply. ive lived in my apart for two years now; after first year one of my roomates switched out and we signed a new lease. the landlord applied a typical 2% rent increase. our lease is for september-september, and two of my roomates have now left with two other (currently subleting) replacing them. we were asked in june if we wanted to renew, to which we said yes
Aug 10 10:52:24 <clessard>	and I let the landlord know the tenants had changed. 
Aug 10 10:53:01 <clessard>	last night my landlord told me out of the blue that with new tenants she can form a new lease and new rent, asking for 400$ more. she said that given the late notice, the lowest she could discuss was about 200$ more. is she allowed to do this ? 
Aug 10 10:54:10 <clessard>	lets discuss in private chat. 
Aug 10 10:54:22 <hukhan>	:(
Aug 10 10:54:40 <ericwill>	AFAIK you are not obligated to renew a lease in Ontario, it goes to month-to-month after a lease expires
Aug 10 10:59:22 <lufimtse_>	clessard, if the increase is more than 1.5%, then usually landlord needs permission I think
Aug 10 10:59:32 <lufimtse_>	(but should be checked)
Aug 10 11:07:46 <jkang|wfh>	I'd probably find someone to call who can give advice on these matters, e.g. Lukas' suggestion with sjto
Aug 10 11:11:29 <jkang|wfh>	clessard, I'm pretty sure, even if it switches to month-to-month, it is still covered by the Residential Tenancies Act, and they can only increase up to the guideline unless they submit a L5 request
Aug 10 11:12:19 <jkang|wfh>	or you both sign a N10
Aug 10 11:16:37 <jkang|wfh>	clessard, once it's month to month they are able to give 60 day notice of termination with good reason. Given your lease is ending Sept. and it's Aug. they probably can't legally get you evicted any time soon
Aug 10 11:23:41 <jkang|wfh>	clessard, also rent increase notice must be 90 days. I think your landlord seems pretty fishy atm. *shrugs*
Aug 10 11:26:01 <clessard>	yeah. shes certainly trying to make it seem like this is a brand new lease and justify the rent increase that way.
Aug 10 11:27:36 <clessard>	im not really sure what shes going to say.. i called and they said that technically neither of us are obliged to contract a new lease
Aug 10 11:27:37 <jkang|wfh>	clessard, if she wants to offer a new lease, she is allowed to do that. You need not accept. And the 60 day termination notice does apply if she wants to evict you. When your lease ends, it automatically becomes month-to-month and you can be removed with 60 day notice and good reason
Aug 10 11:28:17 <clessard>	ahh thats bad
Aug 10 11:36:48 <jkang|wfh>	clessard, also in Ontario, you cannot be evicted without good reason: http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/documents/ltb/Brochures/How%20a%20Landlord%20Can%20End%20a%20Tenancy%20(EN)%20Revised_Bill140_June15_2015.pdf
Aug 10 11:37:27 <jkang|wfh>	though they can just say they'll be using it personally for a month or two or something; and then put it back on the market after. It's generally just a pain for both sides to go this way though...
Aug 10 11:38:08 <clessard>	yeah i agree. i sent her an email about it so ill see what she says. if it needs to be a 5% hike then ill live with it and find something new next year cuz its still a better deal than most places
Aug 10 11:39:04 <jkang|wfh>	clessard, also; even if it's a 'new lease' there are restrictions on what can be changed if it's made with the same tenant. Having new tenants seems pretty shaky since you're still there.
Aug 10 11:39:14 <jkang|wfh>	have to read up on that though...
Aug 10 11:45:30 <lbullen>	 clessard I know that if 50% or more of the tenants leave a place the "only can raise it by X%" rules don't apply. Had to deal with that last year
Aug 10 11:47:18 <clessard>	ah i see.
Aug 10 12:06:36 <jkang|wfh>	clessard, I have yet to find anything concrete on subset of tenants leaving and new lease in the Residential Tenanices Act. I'd probably ask for legal advice..
Aug 10 12:07:57 <clessard>	I cant either. I'll have to wait and see what she says
Aug 14 10:54:25 <dcheung>	lisac: that's an appropriate amount of bananas
Aug 14 10:54:27 <dcheung>	lisac++

Sep 25 16:37:23 <alanm|afk>	whoa !
Sep 25 16:38:26 <alanm>	been a while since I last looked
Sep 25 16:40:49 <patrickm>	if it stays at this level, the ESPP will be interesting [well, for those that participated]
Sep 25 16:50:14 <rgrunber>	http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/7e/7eab3f075e03695e2e5402574097567847dc3dc5cf85235d3b35f150eb44584f.jpg
Sep 25 17:40:37 <fche>	holy moly
Sep 25 22:32:04 *	rgb maxed in.  :-)
Sep 26 10:34:51 <dmsimard>	I was in the first ESPP window but opted out of the second, needed more on each of those paychecks.. but damn, yeah, two awesome quarters back to back
Sep 26 10:35:07 <rgrunber>	pew pew pew
Sep 26 10:35:53 <dmsimard>	What are the dates for the bonuses ? I know it's once per quarter but never really added them to my calendar..
Sep 26 10:36:24 <dmsimard>	I'm okay with "some time after quarterly results" but thinking there might be a more precise rule to it
Sep 26 10:39:48 <rgrunber>	dmsimard: i would say mid-way through the next quarter-ish.. ?
Sep 26 10:43:45 <mbenitez>	end of October [a month after the company mtg]
Sep 26 10:44:37 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: would that be for previous quarter.. or this quarter.. ?
Sep 26 10:45:11 <rgrunber>	*i guess i mean quarter being discussed now..
Sep 26 10:46:13 <dmsimard>	ok so about a month after quarter results, sure
Sep 26 10:46:52 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, we're already in Q3 but this call is about Q2 results, the bonus will be for Q2
Sep 26 10:47:26 <rgrunber>	k, yeah that's what i meant.. so it's Q2 cool :)
Sep 26 10:47:30 <mbenitez>	dmsimard, yes, Quarters end in month X, results are announced month X+1, bonuses X+2
Sep 26 10:50:58 <patrickm>	dmsimard: VC bonuses: end of Jan, Apr, July, Oct [if the company meets the stated goals of course... there's no sure thing]
Sep 26 10:51:39 <patrickm>	well, that's when they are distributed in Canada... other geos have different timings depending on their pay schedule

Sep 26 11:16:44 <dmsimard>	I set up a slack to IRC bridge for one of my channels on freenode. Works nicely and allows people in one to chat with people from the other seamlessly
Sep 26 11:17:24 <dmsimard>	I don't like slack but you have to pick your battles and recognize that IRC is not for everyone
Sep 26 11:17:59 <dmsimard>	Slack vs Rocketchat vs Mattermost vs Discord is another topic of course
Sep 26 11:20:28 <jkang>	hmm apparently heat warning for southern Ontario, wow

Sep 26 13:59:25 <steveg>	dcheung, so belatedly responding i did see your message some time ago about the virtual disks
Sep 26 13:59:35 <steveg>	dcheung, it seems possible (likely) that SAN might be being flaky?
Sep 26 13:59:49 <steveg>	dcheung, i dont seem to be having any issues with the VM disks in the other cluster
Sep 26 14:00:05 <steveg>	dcheung, even though they are on a consumer grade system held together by baling twine that is serving up NFS...
Sep 26 14:00:09 <dcheung>	steveg: possible really. we do revert to snapshots a lot though. so I don't know if that causes issues
Sep 26 14:00:22 <steveg>	dcheung, yeah well that is the other side of it
Sep 26 14:00:28 <steveg>	dcheung, we're now a long way behind in RHV versions
Sep 26 14:00:41 <steveg>	dcheung, i need to sit down and plan out how to get us from 3.6->4
Sep 26 14:01:01 <dcheung>	that SAN setup for the migration will be interesting :)
Sep 26 14:01:05 <steveg>	dcheung, it may end up being easier to schedule an outage for it than trying to do it online
Sep 26 14:01:10 <steveg>	dcheung, hah, yeah :/
Sep 26 14:01:21 <dcheung>	steveg: yup, I'm ok with outage
Sep 26 14:01:29 <steveg>	doing it online requires a bit of a shell game to move the hypervisors around
Sep 26 14:06:23 <steveg>	dcheung, i think the scariest part is yeah, replicating that local networking setup between torricelli and the SAN
Sep 26 14:06:48 <steveg>	dcheung, in ideal world i think we would make it go through the switch instead but not sure how easy it is to change that from RHVs POV
Sep 26 14:08:34 <dcheung>	steveg: if you set the SAN via the switch, we can then *just* setup authentication on the rhev master right? and then the wiring to torricelli will automagically happen?
Sep 26 14:09:09 <steveg>	dcheung, yeah - the thing is it's not clear to me how easy it is to change the storage domain in place in RHV and keep the mapping to all the disks
Sep 26 14:09:27 <steveg>	dcheung, when i look at the edit domain screen it has those 172.* IPs in there but not clear they can be edited
Sep 26 14:09:58 <steveg>	dcheung, it might be because the domain is active tho
Sep 26 14:10:09 <steveg>	dcheung, it may become available for edit when in maintenance mode

Sep 28 10:36:41 <nboldt>	dcheung: thanks. you recommend workstation over server version?
Sep 28 10:36:58 <nboldt>	... or client?
Sep 28 10:37:07 *	nboldt has no idea how they're different 
Sep 28 10:37:50 <dcheung>	nboldt: I don't know the difference between them :(
Sep 28 10:38:00 <omajid-wfh>	if you need docker, go server
Sep 28 10:38:07 <omajid-wfh>	workstation doesnt have docker :(
Sep 28 10:39:01 <nboldt>	omajid-wfh: yep, I'll need docker
Sep 28 10:39:05 <nboldt>	thanks!
Sep 28 10:39:50 <rgrunber>	or you can get workstation and install the server packages #troublemaker
Sep 28 10:40:36 <omajid-wfh>	if you want to have fun all around, just use fedora!
Sep 28 10:42:16 <nboldt>	omajid-wfh: I prefer fedora but I can't test DevTools subscription stuff with that as it requires actual RHEL

Oct 13 09:59:29 <lberk>	because it couldn't be used to buy a whole share at discount?

Nov 06 12:35:23 <rgrunber>	did we get a new microwave ?.. or did the toaster bring me to a subtly different reality..
Nov 06 12:42:39 <thauser>	rgrunber, it's new 
Nov 06 12:43:06 <rgrunber>	..nice
Nov 07 10:28:37 <patrickm>	lisac: with the arrival yesterday of the santa claus parade form, i was thinking back to the very successful Stollen Bake-off of 2016
Nov 07 10:29:48 <patrickm>	lisac: this year, perhaps we'l change it up to a Cookie Bake Off or a Local Bakery Showdown [as I don't know if I could eat just gingerbread cookies for six weeks]
Nov 07 10:31:25 <patrickm>	lisac: i'm liking the Local Bakery Showdown... Robyn's, Rahier, Grodzinski, etc
Nov 07 10:31:56 <patrickm>	lisac: i'm away for the next 2 weeks, so when I get back, we'll start [whatever we choose]
Nov 07 10:32:50 <lisac>	patrickm, or we could have an office bake off:-)
Nov 07 10:32:57 <dcheung>	lisac: +1000
Nov 07 10:32:58 <patrickm>	lisac: and maybe, just maybe, we can bring mwringe out of retirement
Nov 07 10:33:05 <patrickm>	hmmmm
Nov 07 10:34:05 <lisac>	we could have one day when the cookies are brought in and those who bake are the judges...
Nov 07 10:34:13 <patrickm>	lisac: i'm up for that... but in a no judgment way... as in "I don't what you to feel bad when the entire office loves my cookies more than yours" 
Nov 07 10:34:48 <lisac>	patrickm, won't be a problem:-)
Nov 07 10:34:54 <mwringe>	it has to be a double blind trial
Nov 07 10:35:31 <patrickm>	lisac: i'm totally up for it, but would spread it out so that we don't have 1 day where we have 1000 cookies
Nov 07 10:36:00 <lisac>	patrickm, then we would have cookies for the week...
Nov 07 10:36:21 <patrickm>	lisac: and, by the way, i won't be in the office if you were planning on making an Apple Crumble for my birthday... just thought I'd let you know
Nov 07 10:36:38 <lisac>	patrickm, shoot...had it all set to go...
Nov 07 10:37:17 <dcheung>	lisac: you can still make it. I see no problem with that
Nov 07 10:37:20 <patrickm>	lisac: i have delegated my consumption of said Apple Crumble to dcheung and/or rgrunber 
Nov 07 10:37:21 <lisac>	patrickm, when are you back in the office so we don't have the cookie bake off while your gone
Nov 07 10:37:42 <rgrunber>	yay
Nov 07 10:38:34 <cchianel>	Do cookie pizzas (giant cookies the size of a pizza) count for the bakeoff?
Nov 07 10:38:35 <dcheung>	lisac: the interns also need to experience this delicacy before the end of their term
Nov 07 10:39:00 <patrickm>	cchianel: they do!  speaking of which, that's my prop for the santa claus parade
Nov 07 10:42:04 <cchianel>	BTW, lisac, question: According to https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1101579, we get Monday November 13th off, but Remembrance day is not a statutory holiday in Ontario. Do we get the day off, or does the document need to be updated to include statutory holiday exclusions?
Nov 07 10:45:01 <lisac>	cchianel, we get Remembrance Day...no update necessary:-)
Nov 07 10:45:39 <cchianel>	Redhat++
Nov 07 10:46:47 <rgrunber>	Red\ Hat++
Nov 07 10:52:05 <patrickm>	lisac: i'll be back on Nov 28
Nov 07 10:54:34 <ltulloch>	mmm cookiessss :D
Nov 07 12:20:54 <patrickm>	Highlander: congratulations on your 20th year at Red Hat! 
Nov 07 12:55:53 <rgrunber>	Highlander: mwhaha https://i.imgur.com/Sd7AQsG.gif
Nov 07 12:56:41 <Highlander>	yeah, I think I got one of those for my 15 year anniversary "present"
Nov 07 13:40:49 <chkoehle>	chocolate ice cream is delayed :/ apparently you need to stir it because the outsides touching the bowl turn into proper ice cream, but it shields the center from freezing so the center was just really cold milk... hopefully it'll turn into it properly in ~1 hr
Nov 07 13:42:09 <clessard>	did you ask lisa ?
Nov 07 13:42:18 <clessard>	is it supposed to be fully frozen ? 
Nov 07 13:43:24 <chkoehle>	i figure it has to be like the consistency of the stuff attached to the bowl, cause the center was basically pure liquid
Nov 07 13:43:31 <chkoehle>	unless that ice cream machine freezes things further
Nov 07 13:43:40 <chkoehle>	:(
Nov 07 13:43:51 <clessard>	uhm
Nov 07 13:43:52 <clessard>	im not sure 
Nov 07 13:43:56 <clessard>	you should check with lisa though
Nov 07 13:44:06 <chkoehle>	i was going to bring her the bowl but shes out right now
Nov 07 13:44:09 <clessard>	cuz youre gonna put it in the ice cream maker 
Nov 07 13:44:11 <chkoehle>	but i will do that
Nov 07 13:44:16 <clessard>	id ask to check
Nov 07 13:44:18 <chkoehle>	oh i was going to wait until she comes back
Nov 07 13:44:24 <chkoehle>	and then see what the next step is
Nov 07 13:44:25 <clessard>	true true true true
Nov 07 13:44:36 <clessard>	the next step is to debug the ice cream maker
Nov 07 13:44:37 <chkoehle>	shes the ice cream expert
Nov 07 13:44:39 <chkoehle>	rofl yes
Nov 07 13:45:32 <mwringe>	if the bowl is already frozen and your ingredients are cold, you just need to leave it stirring for a while 
Nov 07 13:46:07 <mwringe>	the more its stirred, the more the liquid ingredients get in contact with the cold bowl and freeze
Nov 07 13:47:44 <chkoehle>	think stirring it every 15-20 minutes is good enough?
Nov 07 13:51:45 <patrickm>	many thanks to whomever placed that package on my chair
Nov 07 13:52:36 <dcheung>	patrickm: np!
Nov 07 13:52:51 <dcheung>	I did shake the box a little bit cause there was 'Fragile' on it
Nov 07 13:52:54 <patrickm>	dcheung: thanks... and thanks for not eating the contents
Nov 07 13:53:20 <patrickm>	dcheung: Christmas cake + coffee from Murchies in BC... delicious
Nov 07 13:53:59 <dcheung>	enjoy! :)
Nov 07 13:54:56 <chkoehle>	20 minutes
Nov 07 13:54:58 <chkoehle>	dun dun dun
Nov 07 14:16:19 <chkoehle>	it is time...
Nov 07 14:26:04 <dcheung>	we have an icecream emergency situation
Nov 07 14:26:31 <lisac>	dcheung, what's up...sorry i'm on a call
Nov 07 14:27:42 <dcheung>	lisac: icecream is too frozen :p
Nov 07 14:28:11 <lisac>	dcheung, you will have to scoop it out..carefully
Nov 07 14:28:47 <dcheung>	we're having lots of engineers trying to fix the situation right now. let's see how many more we need
Nov 07 14:42:26 <dcheung>	chkoehle++
Nov 07 14:45:08 <rgrunber>	icecream is great success.
Nov 07 14:45:22 <rgrunber>	needs to be warmed up once again.. got cold fast..
Nov 07 18:37:50 <rgb>	congrats to the Wellmans, but am I the only one wondering why so many MUAs quote that entire 1MB imaage attachment in the all the replies?
Nov 07 18:38:20 <rgb>	I'd normally archive all this traffic automatically, but that's one thread I'll purge...
Nov 08 09:15:16 <mmillson>	hi lisac, good morning. What is the pto policy in Canada? Can people carry over unused days? In the US we cannot carry over days, and we have until feb 15 to use them. 
Nov 08 09:16:13 <lisac>	mmillson, in Canada we still carry over days as long as you have not hit your maximum accural
Nov 08 09:17:05 <lisac>	mmillson, once you hit your maximum accrual you stop accruing PTO till you take some time off
Nov 08 09:20:13 <mmillson>	ok, ty lisac :-)
Nov 08 09:52:41 <shaym>	lisac, is the max accural listed in orange ?   or we simply follow this mojo https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1044403
Nov 08 09:54:38 <lisac>	shaym, the mojo document is accurate. I don't believe Orange alerts you when you have reached the maximum
Nov 08 09:55:30 <shaym>	lisac, that would be a very  nice feature , if they have it 
Nov 08 09:55:55 <shaym>	saves the need to check every month 
Nov 08 09:56:19 <lisac>	shaym, I will inquire if it can be incorporated
Nov 08 09:56:35 <shaym>	lisac, awesome , thank you !
Nov 08 10:02:03 <jkang>	lisac, do we need to rsvp for the RH Holiday Party?
Nov 08 10:05:23 <rgb>	huh, maximum accrual for India is 42 days
Nov 08 11:45:09 <alanm>	42 ? 
Nov 08 11:46:40 <lisac>	jkang..if you did it on the calendar invite I can see it there...if not then sure let me know...just so we have an estimation on numbers, thanks
Nov 08 12:27:14 <rgb>	alanm: yeah, just over 2 years
Nov 08 12:27:17 <rgb>	2.5...
Nov 08 15:58:25 <patrickm>	lisac: did you receive a note from Staples about the Red Hat Linux shirts [Female] being reshipped?
Nov 08 15:59:17 <lisac>	I did...and i'm glad they made the mistake otherwise the shirts would have been impossible to distinguish
Nov 08 16:03:03 <patrickm>	patrickm: ok, I guess new shirts are on the way 
Nov 08 16:05:03 <sergiodj>	patrickm: thinking aloud?
Nov 08 16:05:34 <patrickm>	sergiodj: no, wanted to make sure it wasn't a scam as they request information 
Nov 08 16:05:56 <sergiodj>	patrickm: it's because you said the last phrase to yourself
Nov 08 16:05:58 <sergiodj>	:-P
Nov 08 16:06:02 <patrickm>	sergiodj: yeah, i know
Nov 08 16:06:22 <sergiodj>	sergiodj: there, you see, he knew it, I told you
Nov 08 16:06:52 <patrickm>	patrickm: you know, you should do something about that sergio guy
Nov 08 16:07:13 <patrickm>	sergiodj: i guess i was thinking aloud!
Nov 08 16:07:40 <sergiodj>	at RH we can all hear everybody's thoughts.  glad we're open like that!
Nov 08 16:07:44 <sergiodj>	;)
Nov 08 20:50:14 <fche>	tofan.yyz appears down; hope someone can give it a kick tomorrow 'morn
Nov 08 20:51:56 <fche>	hm must have been a switch problem or something, the machine seems fine now
Nov 08 21:58:17 <xdcheung>	fche: Italo has been setup a zabbix server to monitor our packet drops this morning. hopefully he'll capture some good data to improve the internet connectivity in our office
Nov 08 21:58:26 <xdcheung>	has been setting up
Nov 09 21:13:41 <rgb>	wow, that changed fast!  went from +6C to -1C in about 10 minutes, thunder storm with rain going sideways to swirling snow in less than 5 minutes.
Nov 10 09:42:57 <alanm>	yeah. it's  -8C with 35KPH winds gusting to 50 around here
Nov 10 09:43:55 <dcheung>	lisac: are we going to get 'winter is coming' pizza today?
Nov 10 09:51:56 <rgrunber>	rhdb represent :P
Nov 10 09:57:39 *	rgb has a layer of snow/frost on his solar panels...
Nov 10 09:58:58 <rgb>	it went to -11C here, wind chill -21
Nov 10 10:11:15 <lisac>	dcheung....not a snow day yet....going to get colder with more white stuff on the ground
