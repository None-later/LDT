Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Hello All:
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Just wanted to let you know that after 26 years Brian and I have decided to retire.
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	We are closing Hannahâ€™s at the close of business today, Fri July 29th.
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Wanted to thank all of you for being such loyal customers over the past years
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	The corporation will continue until we wrap up all of our affairs, but
Jul 29 14:32:29 <lisac>	the restaurant and catering will stop today.
Jul 29 14:32:31 <lisac>	We want to wish you all the best in the years to come.
Jul 29 14:32:33 <lisac>	Regards
Jul 29 14:32:35 <lisac>	Ray &  Brian
Jul 29 14:33:49 *	patrickm shall miss their soup 
Jul 29 14:42:47 <patrickm>	lisac: this could be like Seinfeld's Soup Nazi episode where they are giving away soup in any container you bring in... very tempting
Jul 29 14:45:19 <lisac>	only till the end of today..
Jul 29 14:47:53 <patrickm>	lisac: although, nothing topped Mr Chan's wonton soup
Jul 29 14:48:40 <lisac>	patrickm, very true...i think we are showing our age now:-)
Jul 29 14:54:06 <patrickm>	lisac: yeah, i should install astroturf outside my office so i can yell at the interns to "get off my lawn"

Aug 03 10:05:51 <jooho>	lisac: GM I have a question about flight ticket 
Aug 03 10:06:04 <lisac>	sure
Aug 03 10:06:54 <jooho>	last Friday my flight was canceled and I got refund it. how to apply it to expense?
Aug 03 10:07:35 <lisac>	Have you already been reimbursed for the amount?
Aug 03 10:07:42 <jooho>	not yet
Aug 03 10:07:53 <lisac>	have you submitted the expense?
Aug 03 10:08:54 <jooho>	not yet.. I am trying but need to know ...how to apply it... itemize?
Aug 03 10:09:22 <lisac>	is it on a bank of america card or your personal card?
Aug 03 10:11:15 <jooho>	boa
Aug 03 10:12:11 <lisac>	so then both the expense and the reimbursement should show up in your expense statement.
Aug 03 10:12:30 <jooho>	right
Aug 03 10:12:52 <lisac>	I will confirm with Jeanine but I think you just have to state that the flight was cancelled and reimbursed
Aug 03 10:13:50 <jooho>	should i apply both statement?
Aug 03 10:14:30 <lisac>	I am going to send your question into the help page...will let you know when I hear back

Aug 08 11:37:14 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey
Aug 08 11:37:33 <strykerawb>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-21744
Aug 08 11:37:40 <strykerawb>	we have no idea what to dooooOooOooo
Aug 08 11:38:54 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to pwouters
Aug 08 11:39:53 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   basically we have no API to modify a connection once it's created?
Aug 08 11:41:15 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i believe there should be a way now.. at least we ran into a similar issue when cdk restart meant different certificate so it needed to be reloaded.
Aug 08 11:41:51 <strykerawb>	how did you fix your issue?  is this something i'll need to fix in my code?  or does your code automatically apply?
Aug 08 11:43:03 <strykerawb>	DockerCOnnection doesn't have a setTCPCertPath
Aug 08 11:43:37 <strykerawb>	has a getter but no setter
Aug 08 11:48:24 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: apparently there is a DockerConnectionManager.updateConnection(..) used from EditDockerConnection (wizard)

Aug 11 16:29:07 <yselkowitz>	anyone had issues bringing encrypted phones and/or laptops across the usa/can border?
Aug 11 16:31:01 <sergiodj>	I just crossed the border twice (round-trip), but I did not have any issues
Aug 11 16:40:43 <fche>	yeah but you're not on the watchlist
Aug 11 16:41:16 <fche>	yaakov, both sets of border police can in principle search through your stuff, and not let you cross if you don't cooperate
Aug 11 16:41:26 <sergiodj>	is yselkowitz on the watchlist?
Aug 11 16:41:32 <fche>	shouldn't he be?
Aug 11 16:41:41 <sergiodj>	I don't know, I'm just asking.
Aug 11 16:41:57 <yselkowitz>	I sure hope not
Aug 11 16:41:59 <sergiodj>	or is it something everybody should know?
Aug 11 16:42:11 <fche>	did you not hear about the unfortunate pretzel incident?
Aug 11 16:42:21 <yselkowitz>	I'm talking about my company laptop, which by policy must be encrypted
Aug 11 16:42:26 <yselkowitz>	pretzel incident?
Aug 11 16:43:27 <fche>	or that time, on the danube, with a butler, in the library, with a lead pipe?
Aug 11 16:45:10 <sergiodj>	obvious, right?
Aug 11 16:58:10 <rgrunber>	fbricon: i miss working on that.
Aug 11 17:03:32 <fbricon>	rgrunber: how is DockerConnectionManager detecting I have a running docker daemon?
Aug 11 17:04:58 <rgrunber>	fbricon: assuming you're running a nightly, there is new functionality to automatically look for some standard locations (eg unix://var/run/docker.sock, 127.0.0.1:2375, anything in environment variables like DOCKER_HOST, ...)
Aug 11 17:05:21 <rgrunber>	.. and add them as connections as opposed to just autofill them ..
Aug 11 17:06:18 <rgrunber>	there's also now an extension point so one could write separate plugins that contribute connection settings.. docker.core will discover them and automatically add them.
Aug 11 17:11:08 <fbricon>	rgrunber: thanks, that explains why my CLI build sees an extra connection, compared to my eclipse-run tests. The former uses a more recent docker tools build

Aug 16 10:52:04 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  hi roland :D
Aug 16 10:52:11 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey
Aug 16 10:52:28 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   im sure xavier will ping you shortly
Aug 16 10:52:29 <strykerawb>	but https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-23011 
Aug 16 10:53:00 <strykerawb>	they want this fixed yesterday ;)   
Aug 16 10:53:24 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: there's a fix for it in the upstream bug on review.. i could push it..
Aug 16 10:56:17 <strykerawb>	if im not annoying you, why is a return of object[]{null} possible?  where is that?
Aug 16 10:57:16 <strykerawb>	"a return of a list with a single null entry is possible."
Aug 16 10:58:16 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: it's not intended, but on windows, the script that checks for some environment variables returns 0 even if it fails.
Aug 16 10:58:51 <strykerawb>	where's that code?
Aug 16 10:59:02 <strykerawb>	i vaguely remember such weird environment variable loading script
Aug 16 10:59:14 <rgrunber>	script.bat is the resource.
Aug 16 11:00:13 <rgrunber>	i mean i should be clear, i haven't confirmed it, but it's the only way to get the behaviour observed. and it makes sense because the other providers do the right thing afaict.
Aug 16 11:01:14 <strykerawb>	[rob@rawbdor resources] (master)$ cat script.bat 
Aug 16 11:01:14 <strykerawb>	@echo off
Aug 16 11:01:14 <strykerawb>	SET DOCKER
Aug 16 11:01:19 <strykerawb>	thats the whole script?
Aug 16 11:02:15 <rgrunber>	yeah that's whats run..
Aug 16 11:03:41 <strykerawb>	wtf does that even do? 
Aug 16 11:04:29 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i figure it prints all env variables containing 'DOCKER' as a term.
Aug 16 11:05:05 <rgrunber>	http://ss64.com/nt/set.html
Aug 16 11:05:14 <rgrunber>	'The SET command invoked with a string (and no equal sign) will display a wildcard list of all matching variables'
Aug 16 11:05:54 <strykerawb>	ok so is the issue that the return value of the process is 0 (ie success) even if no such env vars are found?
Aug 16 11:06:30 <strykerawb>	i wouldn't consider that a bug at all... and whatever code you have that runs this batch script and loads it into a list should account for the fact that it may still provide an empty list
Aug 16 11:06:39 <strykerawb>	where's the code that runs the script?
Aug 16 11:07:12 <rgrunber>	ShellConnectionSettingsProvider
Aug 16 11:07:57 <rgrunber>	i have a fix i'll be pushing in + kicking a build, just need to modify how values are returned.
Aug 16 11:09:10 <strykerawb>	i mean xavier's comments are true.  This method just shouldn't be able to return a list with a null value
Aug 16 11:09:11 <strykerawb>					IDockerConnectionSettings setting = createDockerConnectionSettings(dockerSettings);
Aug 16 11:09:11 <strykerawb>					return Arrays.asList(new IDockerConnectionSettings [] { setting });
Aug 16 11:09:17 <strykerawb>	just check if setting is null first?
Aug 16 11:09:52 <strykerawb>	o
Aug 16 11:09:54 <strykerawb>	your patch does that
Aug 16 11:09:55 <strykerawb>	.........
Aug 16 11:10:09 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: yeah empty list would have solved this.. he wants to also return an empty list..
Aug 16 11:10:33 <rgrunber>	ideally i would have just pushed the smallest change that fixes it, but i don't mind also changing the returns to be proper.
Aug 16 11:10:43 <strykerawb>	eh, null vs empty list, your choice.  the question is who's using that api
Aug 16 11:10:59 <strykerawb>	if the caller is expecting a null or a list with 1 element,   then empty list might cause arrayindex shit 
Aug 16 11:11:12 <strykerawb>	or list index
Aug 16 11:11:14 <strykerawb>	whatever it is
Aug 16 11:11:32 <strykerawb>	so i'd advise you do a call heirarchy and see what the assumptions are here
Aug 16 11:12:04 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i can make all my providers return an empty list.. i really think it should be ok.. but i still need to check nulls because someone could just dump a plugin that uses that extension point and returns null.
Aug 16 11:12:36 <strykerawb>	yep
Aug 16 11:12:43 <strykerawb>	ok seems you've got this under control
Aug 16 11:13:59 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: yeah, for now.. just an fyi i've been swamped with eclipse upstream related work so i've not had much time lately to work on the docker tooling.
Aug 16 11:14:23 <rgrunber>	i guess i mean non-docker upstream work :P
Aug 16 11:14:30 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  what stuff you working on now?   
Aug 16 11:15:05 <rgrunber>	Eclipse Orbit.. moving it over to git and ebr (new way of contributing 3rd party libraries)
Aug 16 11:15:36 <strykerawb>	that sounds like pure work :|

Aug 29 11:15:39 <mbenitez>	#toronto free t-shirts and openshift books across from Lisa's office
Aug 29 11:16:00 <jkang>	nice, thanks!
Aug 29 12:11:18 <fche>	mbenitez, are those openshift books on topic for devtools peeps?
Aug 29 12:12:31 <mbenitez>	what I've seen is an introduction to OpenShift 3, how to install it, configure, get your first apps running
Aug 29 14:17:45 <rgb>	is that the free T-shirts from linuxcon?  the monster ones?
Aug 29 14:18:03 *	rgb only saw XL and larger and declined...
Aug 29 14:19:12 <mbenitez>	yes, the ones from linuxcon
Aug 30 10:31:23 <patrickm>	cookies in the kitchen from Honolulu Cookie Company... the chocolate dipped lilikoi is the best  [http://www.honolulucookie.com/] 
Aug 30 10:34:50 <jkang>	thanks!
Aug 30 11:43:08 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  hi roland :D
Aug 30 11:43:20 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey, any luck ?
Aug 30 11:43:26 <strykerawb>	nope!  :D
Aug 30 11:43:41 <strykerawb>	i mean i got it to work in principle but it still doesn't work ;) 
Aug 30 11:44:06 <strykerawb>	the problem is that most vagrant commands i issue this way end up saying that vagrant is trying to talk to the process as if it was a TTY terminal
Aug 30 11:44:23 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i had some suggestions a little while ago for that.
Aug 30 11:44:39 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i didn't have a chance to try them out..
Aug 30 11:44:59 <rgrunber>	(see the jira)
Aug 30 11:45:39 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   yeah...  we're only using machine-readbale during vagrant service-manager env  calls
Aug 30 11:45:43 <strykerawb>	so thats not relevant 
Aug 30 11:45:59 <strykerawb>	and as for wrapping in a call to bash,  um... this stuff needs to work in windows too
Aug 30 11:46:05 <strykerawb>	so we can't really wrap it in bash 
Aug 30 11:47:34 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   is there an official vagrant syntax to avoid the vagrant commands trying to treat the caller as a tty terminal?
Aug 30 11:47:36 <rgrunber>	can you wrap it in bash for just linux ?.. i could have sworn the vagrant code said something like "if not on windows and stdin.tty is false then error"
Aug 30 11:47:38 <strykerawb>	or is it on a per-command basis? 
Aug 30 11:51:22 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i don't think its possible. vagrant expects the stdin stream to be from a tty when not on windows.
Aug 30 11:51:50 <strykerawb>	that seems absolutely horrible as an assumption
Aug 30 11:51:55 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey so.. can you just try running this on windows and see if it works.. i mean.. it seems like it should.
Aug 30 11:52:17 <rgrunber>	'# We can't ask questions when the output isn't a TTY.'
Aug 30 11:52:27 <strykerawb>	where's that from? link?
Aug 30 11:52:35 <rgrunber>	ah one sec.. vagrant sources
Aug 30 11:53:08 <rgrunber>	https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/lib/vagrant/ui.rb#L161
Aug 30 11:54:48 <strykerawb>	see the thing that gets me is the wording in the error itself
Aug 30 11:54:58 <strykerawb>	Most actions in Vagrant that require a TTY have configuration
Aug 30 11:54:58 <strykerawb>	switches to disable this requirement. Please do that or run Vagrant
Aug 30 11:54:58 <strykerawb>	with TTY.
Aug 30 11:55:23 <strykerawb>	so this begs the question:  is there a way to ask questions without tty and its up to the plugins (ie vagrant service-manager) to implement properly a flag?
Aug 30 11:55:35 <strykerawb>	sorry i mean vagrant registration
Aug 30 11:57:27 <strykerawb>	rgrunber, the reason i ask this question is because,  running a simple java program that reads standard in / standard out doesn't require a TTY terminal
Aug 30 11:57:27 <rgrunber>	do they mean that there are configuration switches to answer the 'question' .. rather than.. there's a way to get the questions without TTY requirement.. i mean this is supposed to be a string message geared towards a user.. not a developer who cares about the internals.
Aug 30 11:57:43 <strykerawb>	so i can't see any technical reason they can't ask questions without a tty
Aug 30 11:57:45 <strykerawb>	it makes no sense
Aug 30 11:59:57 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  who do you think we can ask? =P 
Aug 30 12:00:01 <rgrunber>	maybe they send terminal codes through.. and try to confirm the stream is attached to something that could read them.. seems like it's not their problem but meh.
Aug 30 12:00:55 <rgrunber>	you might get a better answer on devtools (hopefully).. if not i'd love to play around with it because i think this is the right approach.. also you're so close.
Aug 30 12:00:57 <strykerawb>	now again, if i simply open a terminal view, connect to the local host, and send to the terminal's stream "vagrant up" it will work
Aug 30 12:01:08 <strykerawb>	bc then it IS a tty terminal
Aug 30 12:01:17 <strykerawb>	but then i can't get a reference to the IProcess
Aug 30 12:01:35 <strykerawb>	or even a java.lang.Process
Aug 30 12:01:42 <rgrunber>	a stream from bash -i should also be a tty though.. if i could get that to work.
Aug 30 12:02:29 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  do you have time to do some pair coding today or tomorrow? not sure on your current work load
Aug 30 12:02:44 <strykerawb>	i suspect the current impl "just works" in windows already
Aug 30 12:02:49 <strykerawb>	when run as admin
Aug 30 12:03:01 <strykerawb>	but to get it to work on both windows and linux is the hard part
Aug 30 12:04:41 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: so weird for me to be like 'yay it works on windows, that's .. actually the really important case' :(
Aug 30 12:05:28 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i'll be in tomorrow. tbh i just wanna tinker with wrapping the call in bash.. that should let isatty() pass.

Sep 01 12:00:00 <patrickm>	i have 4 of the "Code is My Spirit Animal" tshirts left... size men's large... if you want one [even if you have one already] they'll be on the cabinet in my office
Sep 01 12:02:22 <patrickm>	stooke: do you take a mens large?
Sep 01 12:17:13 <rgb>	patrickm: nice SRED numbers!
Sep 01 12:21:06 <patrickm>	rgb: indeed.  it's a relatively small effort [spread over many engineers] that really makes a bottom line difference
Sep 01 14:03:42 <rgb>	patrickm: what's the average percentage of salary saved?
Sep 01 14:04:03 <rgb>	I'm guessing somewhere between 10% and 30%?
Sep 01 14:25:39 <patrickm>	rgb: yes, in that range... total compensation as well, just not straight salary
Sep 01 14:26:37 *	patrickm doesn't see the formulation... i just received the final numbers [federal and provincial]
Sep 01 14:47:43 <patrickm>	lisac: is that cake for any special reason or is it a consume at will?
Sep 01 14:53:15 <rgrunber>	it's probably a social experiement in how long an unopened cake can remain that way in our office.
Sep 01 15:00:54 <patrickm>	rgrunber: i opened them
Sep 01 15:04:44 <steveg>	it's a good policy
Sep 01 15:04:47 <steveg>	when in doubt cake
Sep 01 15:05:10 <patrickm>	steveg: my policy is simpler... "cake"
Sep 01 15:06:16 <rgrunber>	ACCEPT *
Sep 02 10:52:39 <rgrunber>	PSA: careful when using the sink in the kitchen. that little rod that acts as the handle seems to have come off (again?)
Sep 02 10:53:16 <lisac>	Plan on buying a new tap next week...that should solve the problem:-)
Sep 02 10:53:49 <steveg>	i for one welcome our new tap overlord
Sep 02 10:54:42 <rgrunber>	steveg: i guess you could even say we are ruled by some.. number of taps greater than 1.. a grouping of taps.. a ... tapset.
Sep 02 10:55:15 <rgrunber>	.. SystemTap!!
Sep 02 10:55:40 <lisac>	we will have to rename the sink
Sep 02 10:56:17 <rgrunber>	Red Hat SystemTap Online
Sep 02 10:56:30 <rgrunber>	Enterprise Edition
Sep 02 10:56:34 <fche>	with containers
Sep 02 10:56:41 <fche>	that open
Sep 02 10:56:42 <rgrunber>	v3
Sep 02 10:56:43 <fche>	or may shift
Sep 02 10:56:49 <steveg>	not in the sink, containers go in the dishwasher
Sep 02 10:56:56 <fche>	or may the wrath of matt be upon you

Sep 07 14:31:38 <mbenitez>	lisac, thanks for the msg
Sep 07 14:38:27 <dbhole>	lisac: thanks for the heads up, got a text as well
Sep 07 17:49:44 <patrickm>	sweet, sweet hydro
Sep 07 17:50:09 <omajid_away>	glad to hear you have power now :)
Sep 07 17:51:49 <patrickm>	yeah, outage in etobicoke... 5000+ customers hit
Sep 07 17:51:59 <patrickm>	good times on a hot day ;)
Sep 07 17:52:23 <omajid_away>	yikes...
Sep 09 09:25:50 <cdrage>	omg, there's dozens of us! i just joined this channel
Sep 09 09:25:52 <cdrage>	what up from waterloo
Sep 09 09:26:31 <jkang>	morning :)
Sep 09 09:26:42 <dcheung>	you discovered our super secret channel
Sep 09 09:26:46 <yzhang>	Greetings fellow Canadian
Sep 09 09:26:49 <yzhang>	minus dcheung 
Sep 09 09:27:00 <dcheung>	yzhang--
Sep 09 09:27:06 <yzhang>	dcheung++
Sep 09 09:27:07 <cdrage>	hahahah, i just found it while trying to setup kerberos, saw a comment about #toronto channel
Sep 09 09:27:30 <steveg>	this is how it ends isnt it
Sep 09 09:31:47 <patrickm>	steveg: i haven't been down to westford in a month or two... are you still down there constantly?
Sep 09 09:32:15 <steveg>	not in a while
Sep 09 09:32:20 <steveg>	im going to brno on sunday
Sep 09 09:32:26 <steveg>	and was in sweden last week
Sep 09 09:32:27 <steveg>	lol
Sep 09 09:32:32 <steveg>	patrickm, ^^
Sep 09 09:32:51 <patrickm>	steveg: niiiiice
Sep 09 09:33:02 <steveg>	i probably havent been in westford since some time in june or july, but that was like 3 weeks in a row
Sep 09 09:33:13 *	patrickm goes over to steveg's desk to steal his stapler 
Sep 09 09:33:33 <steveg>	gotta work out how to put ye old openstack thingy in them container-roos
Sep 09 09:34:04 <steveg>	i dont have a stapler but you can definitely steal my books :P
Sep 09 09:34:34 <patrickm>	steveg: pffffft... openstack, that's for hipsters!  but that would explain your fondness for skinny jeans and old timey moustaches 
Sep 09 09:36:08 <patrickm>	steveg: but on a more serious side, there is an OpenStack Day in Montreal [November 22]... are you heading to that?
Sep 09 09:36:46 <patrickm>	i was thinking about taking a road trip for that
Sep 09 09:39:10 <steveg>	patrickm, unclear atm
Sep 09 09:39:21 <steveg>	patrickm, i havent specifically put my hand up but probably will
Sep 09 09:40:20 <patrickm>	steveg: fair enough, let me know
Sep 09 11:28:28 *	rgb wonders if steveg also has a fixie...
Sep 09 12:22:25 *	alanm wonders if rgb wants to add more wheels to said fixie 
Sep 09 12:38:14 *	rgb wants an original fixie, aka a 60" penny-farthing.
Sep 09 13:49:22 *	alanm wonders about attempting a track stand on a penny-farthing... it's a loonnggg way down to the ground.
Sep 09 14:21:02 *	rgb has ridden a penny-farthing several times and quite enjoyed the sensation, but has otherwise no interest in owning a matching-wheel chain-driven fixie...
Sep 09 14:24:35 *	alanm has never wanted a fixie. I'd rather get a cyclo-cross bike that I can take up to the cottage with me and use it as a rain bike when I'm in town
Sep 09 15:05:24 <strykerawb>	rgrunber, please kill me
Sep 09 15:05:27 <strykerawb>	i'll provide the weapon
Sep 09 15:05:34 <strykerawb>	i'll instruct my family to dispose of the weapon afterwards too
Sep 09 15:38:35 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: whatsup?
Sep 09 15:38:54 <strykerawb>	so was testing my QE's complaints of our nice terminal solution on windows
Sep 09 15:39:09 *	alanm suggests that a barrel of napalm(TM) works well
Sep 09 15:39:11 <strykerawb>	first problem was easy to solve:  he said when he typed intput it didnt show.  easy fix, boolean somewhere. 
Sep 09 15:39:19 <strykerawb>	however.........
Sep 09 15:39:29 <strykerawb>	vagrant's output is something like this
Sep 09 15:39:41 <strykerawb>	Do you want to register the CDK? [y/n]:   {you type here}
Sep 09 15:39:47 <strykerawb>	so i type y,  enter.  and wait
Sep 09 15:39:54 <strykerawb>	nothing.   i press enter again.  then it says
Sep 09 15:39:56 <strykerawb>	"Username:  "
Sep 09 15:40:06 <strykerawb>	i type "rst" and it cuts me off, somehow recognizing my 2nd enter 
Sep 09 15:40:09 <strykerawb>	and says "Password:  " 
Sep 09 15:40:29 <strykerawb>	i type a password, press enter,  nothing.   Press enter a 2nd time,  craps out again in similar fashion
Sep 09 15:41:01 <strykerawb>	so then i thought well this is really weird, so instead of running "vagrant up" i had it run "java SimpleIO"  (some shtity main class i made that does i/o... asks questions, you type response, etc)
Sep 09 15:41:04 <strykerawb>	worked 100% as expected
Sep 09 15:41:07 <strykerawb>	fails 100% with vagrant
Sep 09 15:41:09 <strykerawb>	kill me
Sep 09 15:41:11 <strykerawb>	with fire
Sep 09 15:41:14 <strykerawb>	napalm even 
Sep 09 15:41:23 <strykerawb>	buy it from alanm .... he sounds like the kinda guy with a stockpile
Sep 09 15:41:38 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: so the bug is with vagrant, and specifically on windows ?
Sep 09 15:42:05 <strykerawb>	i would assume thats the situation. i mean i haven't tested 30 or 40 scenarios or anything
Sep 09 15:42:19 <strykerawb>	im not sure what other windows commands ask for user input
Sep 09 15:42:26 <strykerawb>	so i can test in other frames
Sep 09 15:43:19 <alanm>	it's only a suggestion ... I was going to suggest ammonium nitrate (fertilizer) and some dynamite but there are laws about that sort of thing.
Sep 09 15:43:42 <strykerawb>	depends on the country
Sep 09 15:43:43 <rgrunber>	alanm: Rob doesn't get hung up on these 'laws' you speak of.
Sep 09 15:44:17 <rgrunber>	i think you'd probably know more if you could see the raw stream in the linux case, and the windows case..
Sep 09 15:44:17 <strykerawb>	if you're about to kill yourself, what right do mortal men have to stop me from doing it in a blaze of glory?
Sep 09 15:45:01 <stooke>	strykerawb i know nothing  of what you're trying to solve with vagrant, is it a Java util, and could it be using the jline library to do console input?
Sep 09 15:45:24 <dcheung>	also there's aesh
Sep 09 15:45:34 <dcheung>	but vagrant is for vm setup
Sep 09 15:45:36 <strykerawb>	vagrant itself is a VM-runner basically.   runs virtualbox or others... has plugins, etc.   
Sep 09 15:45:47 <strykerawb>	all in ruby i believe
Sep 09 15:48:15 <jkang>	supposedly targeted at consistent dev environments for a team to reduce cases of "works on my machine"
Sep 09 15:49:03 <rgrunber>	jkang: you're supposedly lacks any element of sarcasm.
Sep 09 15:49:06 <rgrunber>	your*
Sep 09 15:49:30 <alanm>	how about a one way shipping box to Redmond ? 
Sep 09 15:49:56 <jkang>	oh yes no sarcasm at all :D though I admit it's a nice concept
Sep 09 15:50:22 <jkang>	and "works on my machine but not yours" does happen more than enough to be annoying
Sep 09 15:50:40 <alanm>	haha
Sep 09 15:50:40 <strykerawb>	utopia is also a nice concept
Sep 09 15:50:53 <alanm>	so what else is new ?
Sep 09 15:51:12 <strykerawb>	this is obama's fault
Sep 09 15:51:14 <strykerawb>	thanks obama
Sep 09 15:51:17 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i still think the answer is in the vagrant code somewhere.. and in seeing the raw stream.. might bring some clues.
Sep 09 15:51:24 <strykerawb>	(sorry, im muhrikan, interoping in your socialist paradise)
Sep 09 15:51:29 *	alanm will leave you young'uns to figure things out.
Sep 09 15:51:33 <strykerawb>	interloping
Sep 09 15:59:52 <patrickm>	fche: which engineer is planning on giving the FSOSS talk?
Sep 09 16:00:12 <fche>	I gather csanting mainly
Sep 09 16:00:36 <fche>	may his soul survive unscathed
Sep 09 16:01:36 <patrickm>	godspeed csanting
Sep 09 16:04:32 <fche>	we might want to pre-reserve a cemetery plot, just in case
Sep 09 16:05:06 <alanm>	what ? no exorcisms or burning at the stake ? That's no fun
Sep 09 16:07:43 <rgb>	if you are talking about burning, an urn takes a lot less space than a coffin...
Sep 09 16:08:05 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: fwiw if i find some spare cycles i wouldn't mind having a look.. although step 1 would literally be get my hands on a windows box..
Sep 09 16:08:33 <strykerawb>	and then getting vagrant... and cdk... and lots of other stuff up ;) 
Sep 09 16:08:38 <fche>	rgrunber is trying out for defenestration
Sep 09 16:08:50 <strykerawb>	CDK:  Coder Defenestration Kit
Sep 09 16:08:58 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hah.. don't wanna think about it..
Sep 09 16:09:21 <strykerawb>	the europeans all know that word... apparently there was a war called the defenestration war or something
Sep 09 16:09:36 <strykerawb>	The Defenestrations of Prague
Sep 09 16:10:46 <alanm>	lol
Sep 09 16:13:03 <rgrunber>	i've heard it's a great city.. should definitely add it on my list to .. czech it out.
Sep 09 16:17:13 <strykerawb>	i hear its a great place to defenestrate people and things
Sep 09 16:32:38 <alanm>	just remember to keep that surplus T-72 tank in the barn where it belongs
Sep 09 16:43:57 *	rgb plans to visit prague after devconf.cz with luiz.
Sep 09 16:45:49 *	rgb being francophone loves the word defenestration
Sep 09 16:55:28 *	rgb discovers there was more than one defenestration in prague!

Sep 12 15:53:14 *	patrickm was just looking at the Red Hat Course selection.... RHCSA offered in Toronto Oct 31-Nov 04 and Jan 30-Feb 03
Sep 12 15:53:46 <patrickm>	and they are close by... 40 Eglinton Ave East
Sep 12 15:54:38 <patrickm>	[interns are allowed as well]
Sep 13 03:26:11 <steveg>	patrickm, i actually think they have a kiosk at exit certified now as well so if people just want to do the exam that is an option too
Sep 13 07:44:35 <patrickm>	steveg: good to know, thanks
Sep 13 12:05:44 <patrickm>	dbhole, lberk, thauser|gym: did you guys get the  Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)  blast from UofT? 
Sep 13 12:06:46 <dbhole>	patrickm: yeah, got one a few min ago
Sep 13 12:07:21 <patrickm>	dbhole: ok, as long as one of you guys got it
Sep 13 12:23:51 <lberk>	patrickm: any change in our end of things in regards to recruiting from that program? (iirc the 15K stipend from the program itself helps)
Sep 13 12:25:16 <patrickm>	lberk: that's for you to decide... part of the internship co-ordination is investigating new opportunities  
Sep 13 12:26:13 <lberk>	will do
Sep 13 13:51:41 <patrickm>	lisac: is there a specific one for Canada?  This one, while claiming to be for North America, seems to be US centric -> https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1032763

Sep 14 12:28:30 <strykerawb>	rgrunber, whatcha doin today? ;) 
Sep 14 12:29:35 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: not sure if i'll have time to look into it.. we'll see.. it's on my list.
Sep 14 12:30:33 <rgrunber>	i did set up a windows box with vagrant+virtualbox so should be ready once we download devstudio + your plugin.
Sep 14 13:45:39 <chrisphi_>	FYI: Down the street (140 Eglinton Ave, where Filthy McNasty's was?) is now a branch of  "La Carnitas" which has good taco's etc . I regularly eat  at the one at 501 College and recommend it (of course they have good beers too... 8-)
Sep 14 13:46:13 <lisac>	chrisphi_, and ice cream next door....
Sep 14 13:46:23 <chrisphi_>	{thats 140 Eglinton Ave East....}
Sep 14 13:46:29 <chrisphi_>	:-)
Sep 14 13:49:20 <dbhole>	chrisphi_: no takeout though :(
Sep 14 13:50:35 <chrisphi_>	dbhole: Hmm maybe they will figure that out if enough people suggest it ;-)
Sep 14 13:50:41 <dbhole>	:)
Sep 14 13:53:15 <dcheung>	I think lisac mises the icecream
Sep 14 13:53:19 <dcheung>	misses
Sep 14 15:19:13 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  ping
Sep 14 15:19:21 <strykerawb>	found out CDT has a "Spawner" class which extends Process 
Sep 14 15:19:27 <rgrunber>	hey
Sep 14 15:19:28 <strykerawb>	launches commands through a PTY
Sep 14 15:19:38 <strykerawb>	pty = pseudo-tty
Sep 14 15:19:48 <strykerawb>	i'll try that solution i guess 
Sep 14 15:19:52 <strykerawb>	but it adds a dep on us to CDT
Sep 14 15:19:56 <strykerawb>	worst case i can copy the class i guess
Sep 14 15:20:16 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hmm so using that instead of runtime.getruntime() you mean ?
Sep 14 15:20:23 <strykerawb>	yes
Sep 14 15:20:30 <rgrunber>	worth a shot.. 
Sep 14 15:20:57 <rgrunber>	assuming the problem is is vagrant being unable to detect certain things from java-side.
Sep 14 15:22:35 <strykerawb>	the problem is vagrant just thinks its talking to a tty
Sep 14 15:22:40 <strykerawb>	vagrant really should fix their side
Sep 14 15:22:47 <strykerawb>	there's no reason they need to treat it as a pty/tty
Sep 14 15:22:50 <rgrunber>	and it moves the point of failure to cdt's win32 x86_64 code.
Sep 14 15:22:52 <rgrunber>	:P..
Sep 14 15:35:40 <patrickm>	dcheung: are you suggesting ice cream tomorrow?
Sep 14 15:36:24 <lisac>	patrickm, great....your turn to make it:-)
Sep 14 15:37:16 <patrickm>	lisac: i'll give it a go... as long as i don't have to clean up ;)
Sep 14 15:37:48 *	patrickm can be more "experimental and creative" that way
Sep 14 15:38:07 <lisac>	patrickm, oh NO....that is all part of it:-)
Sep 14 15:38:45 <patrickm>	lisac: then, alas, I must decline due to your restrictions on my creative freedom
Sep 14 15:39:58 <lisac>	patrickm, i did not restrict that....
Sep 14 15:45:33 *	patrickm will just bring in $10 for Sweet Jesus instead
Sep 14 20:58:16 *	rgb would make ice cream if he were around to do it...

Sep 22 10:52:49 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: https://post-office.corp.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo :P
Sep 22 10:54:42 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, there are 4611 lists out there.
Sep 22 10:54:59 <rgrunber>	https://post-office.corp.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/brno-ddr-list
Sep 22 10:56:09 <rgrunber>	i honestly never gave too much of a thought about memo-list having tech-list topics until that thread.. and then said yeah..
Sep 22 16:10:19 <patrickm>	just got a call from the Mothership [Raleigh], apparently the round phone in the video conference room on the Sales side is unplugged.  
Sep 22 16:11:11 <patrickm>	i just got home to beat the traffic, if there is someone in the office that could wander over and plug it in, Raleigh would appreciate it
Sep 22 16:11:19 <patrickm>	[and let me know]
Sep 22 16:13:17 <jwellman>	Someone is in there filming a presentation; I'll check in again in a little bit
Sep 22 16:13:43 <patrickm>	jwellman: thanks
Sep 22 16:14:13 <jwellman>	np
Sep 22 17:26:58 <patrickm>	jwellman: did you complete your task?
Sep 23 11:52:29 <fnasser>	Highlander, Hi Andrew, it is Friday, maybe it is time for us to educate us a bit on the tax implications of the ESPP participation?  :-)
Sep 23 11:53:13 <fnasser>	Highlander, When is the tax over that percentage taken?  Is that percentage taken after tax in the payroll?
Sep 23 13:11:01 <Highlander>	fnasser:  THe way this normnally works :  whatever the market price is when you get the shares minus whatever you paid for them is charged to you as a taxable benefit.
Sep 23 13:11:35 <Highlander>	so you'll pay your normal tax rate on that difference.     I havent seen any documentation on our plan, but Id be surprised if they did it any other way
Sep 23 13:12:54 <Highlander>	they may use different words for the benefit, but it's likely to be that way.
Sep 23 13:14:42 <Highlander>	Karen was in IBM's ESPP for a while and it boiled down to that, althogh they did some funny calculations every pay cheque that I never really understood so that you didnt get a bit tax hit twice a year on your paycheque when they were issued for the benefit.  
Sep 23 13:24:25 <rgb>	I know it isn't open until Monday, but has anyone got any idea what to put in username/password or SSN in "register now"?
Sep 23 13:36:21 <rgb>	sorry, under "outside US", "participant number"
Sep 23 13:49:15 <fnasser>	Highlander, That makes sense at the end, but how does it affect the tax in each pay date -- that amount, lets say 10% was stil earninsg, so subject to tax right?
Sep 23 13:50:08 <fnasser>	Highlander, So we pay tax on the money we "saved" on each paycheck, then pay a bit more on the profit we made by buying below marked when the stocks are bought every 6 months
Sep 23 13:50:48 <fnasser>	Highlander, In other words, the 10% wil come from your net pay each payroll
Sep 23 13:50:52 <Highlander>	that I don't know.     I expect you'll pay tax on "income" of 15% of your deduction amount since that is guaranteed.
Sep 23 13:51:18 <Highlander>	maybe they amortize the rest over the next 6 months or do it all at once at 6 month, although that woudl siurprise me.
Sep 23 13:51:32 <fnasser>	Like 10% of the gross is taken from the net 
Sep 23 13:51:56 <Highlander>	I never did figure IBMs out.. they may have been "guessing" based on the current stock price.  not sure. It was rarelty the sameamount
Sep 23 13:52:46 <fnasser>	Highlander, I guess there is only oe way to find out -- try it for 6 months
Sep 23 13:53:16 <fnasser>	Highlander, I wonder if with the taxes and all it is still worth of "saving" this way
Sep 23 13:53:40 <fnasser>	Highlander, The profits increase if the market goes up but then the stock funds will also go up
Sep 23 13:53:51 <Highlander>	they know you will get at least 15% of a benefit from your deducated amount, so they will likely tax you on at least that amount each cheque I would think
Sep 23 13:54:20 <fnasser>	Above the regular tax on salary income?
Sep 23 13:54:21 <Highlander>	its like RSUs.. you only see half of what the benefit is :-P
Sep 23 13:54:30 <fnasser>	That is where the money is comming from anyway
Sep 23 13:54:33 <Highlander>	it ought to be taxed like regular salary
Sep 23 13:55:30 <Highlander>	when you get a taxable benefit, that number is added to your salary for that paycheque, and the federal tax tables are used on that number for your deducation that cheque
Sep 23 13:55:37 <fnasser>	Highlander, We have to decide to take part and how much next week, and I am still not fully convinced it is worth doing it
Sep 23 13:55:45 <Highlander>	so its effectively taxing you like a salary increase :-P
Sep 23 13:56:05 <fnasser>	Highlander, Shouldn't it be capital gain?  Lower tax 
Sep 23 13:56:20 <Highlander>	well, in theory your after tax profit is guatranteed to be at least 7.5% of whatever you put in :-)
Sep 23 13:56:20 <fnasser>	Highlander, Well, at least any gains above the 15% is capital gain
Sep 23 13:56:50 <fnasser>	Highlander, So a savings account with a 6 month return of 7.5% ?
Sep 23 13:56:58 <fnasser>	after tax
Sep 23 13:57:01 <Highlander>	depends on whetehr they categorize it as a stock benefit. if they do, then you'll pay even less tax.. but IM not convinced.  gains on RSus are taxed at your salary rate
Sep 23 13:57:32 <Highlander>	I dont think capital gains will come into it until after you own the stock
Sep 23 13:57:53 <fnasser>	Highlander, but whatever I make when I sell the RSU stock I've got is taxed as capita gain (or los)
Sep 23 13:57:55 <fnasser>	loss
Sep 23 13:58:11 <Highlander>	yes. once you own it, its all capital gain/loss
Sep 23 13:58:37 <fnasser>	Highlander, Ah, that is true, so the percentage above 15% is still before I got the stocks
Sep 23 13:58:44 <fnasser>	in the case of the ESPP
Sep 23 13:58:45 <Highlander>	but they tax you on it before they issue it to you.. so its at salary rate.  I would expect the ESPP to be similar.. but we can hope not. 
Sep 23 13:59:23 <fnasser>	Nah, fat chance, you are right, we are buying it below marked price and that can be more than 15% if the stocks went up
Sep 23 13:59:34 <fnasser>	But... maybe there is a bit of law specifically for that case
Sep 23 13:59:44 <fnasser>	To incentive investing or something
Sep 23 13:59:58 <Highlander>	I suspect the tax law works such that if they did it any other way, the company is on the hook for the difference .  THis way, it all on us
Sep 23 14:00:33 <fnasser>	Highlander, Anyway, bottom line is that it is still a savings account on steroids given the currently interest paied around, right?
Sep 23 14:01:12 <Highlander>	indeed. Its basically some free money
Sep 23 14:01:23 <fnasser>	Highlander, Got it!
Sep 23 14:01:26 <Highlander>	unles you are incredibly unlucky and the stock price drops by more than 15% before you can sell it :-)
Sep 23 14:01:35 <Highlander>	so there is still a TINY risk.
Sep 23 14:02:26 <Highlander>	if we had a black monday on exactly the wrong day.    I'd guess we'd have more pressing concerns if that happened tho :-) 
Sep 23 14:02:56 <fnasser>	Highlander, Rigt, I even think it happened when we had it a long time ago, but I just hung to my shares for a bit and they came back up.
Sep 23 14:02:59 <fnasser>	Highlander,   Thanks again Andrew! 
Sep 23 14:04:15 <Highlander>	np.  Glad to make stuff up anytime!
Sep 23 14:05:35 <fnasser>	:-)
Sep 23 14:10:17 <patrickm>	fnasser, Highlander: https://mojo.redhat.com/servlet/JiveServlet/previewBody/1091225-102-1-1838864/Canada%20ESPP.pdf
Sep 23 14:10:27 <patrickm>	[specific to Canada]
Sep 23 14:11:47 <fnasser>	patrickm, Thanks, will read that
Sep 23 14:12:18 <patrickm>	it answers some of the questions your were asking, not that Highlander's direction was incorrect
Sep 23 14:12:40 <patrickm>	rgb: what's the issue?  do you not have an existing Fidelity account?
Sep 23 14:13:47 <Highlander>	it doesnt address when they will take the amount., If they charge you tax on the full amount for 6 months of discount on one chqeue, that could really hurt that cheque a lot.  
Sep 23 14:15:22 <Highlander>	and they imply thats when you get charged.. we shall see.
Sep 23 14:15:43 <Highlander>	unless they issue you less shares to cover the tax due... which I suppose is possible since thats what they do with RSUs
Sep 23 14:16:36 <Highlander>	and that mechanism is already in place.. so thats probably what they'll do...  its the path of least work for them :-)
Sep 23 15:16:01 <rgb>	patrickm: do I have a fidelity account?
Sep 23 15:18:57 <patrickm>	rgb: yeah, do you have an existing account.  on monday, you'll just log in using the Ixxxxxxx userid / password combo and sign up there
Sep 23 15:19:25 <patrickm>	<rgb> sorry, under "outside US", "participant number"
Sep 23 15:25:34 <rgb>	patrickm: where do I find that number?
Sep 23 15:26:13 <rgb>	is it called something else?
Sep 23 15:27:02 <rgb>	related to dpsp?
Sep 23 15:27:13 <patrickm>	rgb: no, that's sunlife
Sep 23 15:27:48 <patrickm>	rgb: do you receive snail mail notifications from fidelity?   
Sep 23 15:28:04 <patrickm>	if so, it's on there as Participant Number
Sep 23 15:32:09 <rgb>	that doesn't ring a bell.  the only snail mail I receive is sunlife, for several different plans.
Sep 23 15:34:14 <rgb>	why would I have a fidelity number?
Sep 23 15:34:37 <fche>	you haven't received any stock-oriented benefits ever?
Sep 23 15:35:03 <rgb>	never.  it wasn't offered at hire.  I asked about it, but it wasn't available.
Sep 23 15:35:56 <fche>	ok ... I'm sure your manager etc. can tweak the right knobs to get things set up for you if you want to participate in the new program
Sep 23 15:36:15 <fche>	I don't recall whether we could sign up for the fidelity system on our own initiative and associate it with the RH company 
Sep 23 15:36:22 <stooke>	Ther's a line in the "Important ESPP Enrollment Information" email: "You will receive a separate enrollment communication from Fidelity on or about September 26th"
Sep 23 15:36:29 <fche>	at worst, ping the hr helpdesk?
Sep 23 15:37:06 <stooke>	So perhaps we get the number on Monday?
Sep 23 15:37:23 <fche>	could be!
Sep 23 15:37:24 <patrickm>	rgb: so the answer to the question is "i don't have an account"... both fche and stooke have provided good direction
Sep 23 15:41:58 <rgb>	ok, so I may see something monday.  I wish that were in the FAQs.

Sep 29 09:40:51 <green>	has anyone looked in detail at the ESPP program?  Specifically... when does our CAD get converted to USD?  Per pay period?  Or at the end of the 6 month period?
Sep 29 09:44:09 <green>	If it's done in bulk just before purchasing the stock, do we have the option to pull out if there's a huge negative swing in the exchange rate?
