Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Hello All:
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Just wanted to let you know that after 26 years Brian and I have decided to retire.
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	We are closing Hannahâ€™s at the close of business today, Fri July 29th.
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Wanted to thank all of you for being such loyal customers over the past years
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	The corporation will continue until we wrap up all of our affairs, but
Jul 29 14:32:29 <lisac>	the restaurant and catering will stop today.
Jul 29 14:32:31 <lisac>	We want to wish you all the best in the years to come.
Jul 29 14:32:33 <lisac>	Regards
Jul 29 14:32:35 <lisac>	Ray &  Brian
Jul 29 14:33:49 *	patrickm shall miss their soup 
Jul 29 14:42:47 <patrickm>	lisac: this could be like Seinfeld's Soup Nazi episode where they are giving away soup in any container you bring in... very tempting
Jul 29 14:45:19 <lisac>	only till the end of today..
Jul 29 14:47:53 <patrickm>	lisac: although, nothing topped Mr Chan's wonton soup
Jul 29 14:48:40 <lisac>	patrickm, very true...i think we are showing our age now:-)
Jul 29 14:54:06 <patrickm>	lisac: yeah, i should install astroturf outside my office so i can yell at the interns to "get off my lawn"

Aug 03 10:05:51 <jooho>	lisac: GM I have a question about flight ticket 
Aug 03 10:06:04 <lisac>	sure
Aug 03 10:06:54 <jooho>	last Friday my flight was canceled and I got refund it. how to apply it to expense?
Aug 03 10:07:35 <lisac>	Have you already been reimbursed for the amount?
Aug 03 10:07:42 <jooho>	not yet
Aug 03 10:07:53 <lisac>	have you submitted the expense?
Aug 03 10:08:54 <jooho>	not yet.. I am trying but need to know ...how to apply it... itemize?
Aug 03 10:09:22 <lisac>	is it on a bank of america card or your personal card?
Aug 03 10:11:15 <jooho>	boa
Aug 03 10:12:11 <lisac>	so then both the expense and the reimbursement should show up in your expense statement.
Aug 03 10:12:30 <jooho>	right
Aug 03 10:12:52 <lisac>	I will confirm with Jeanine but I think you just have to state that the flight was cancelled and reimbursed
Aug 03 10:13:50 <jooho>	should i apply both statement?
Aug 03 10:14:30 <lisac>	I am going to send your question into the help page...will let you know when I hear back

Aug 08 11:37:14 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey
Aug 08 11:37:33 <strykerawb>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-21744
Aug 08 11:37:40 <strykerawb>	we have no idea what to dooooOooOooo
Aug 08 11:38:54 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to pwouters
Aug 08 11:39:53 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   basically we have no API to modify a connection once it's created?
Aug 08 11:41:15 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i believe there should be a way now.. at least we ran into a similar issue when cdk restart meant different certificate so it needed to be reloaded.
Aug 08 11:41:51 <strykerawb>	how did you fix your issue?  is this something i'll need to fix in my code?  or does your code automatically apply?
Aug 08 11:43:03 <strykerawb>	DockerCOnnection doesn't have a setTCPCertPath
Aug 08 11:43:37 <strykerawb>	has a getter but no setter
Aug 08 11:48:24 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: apparently there is a DockerConnectionManager.updateConnection(..) used from EditDockerConnection (wizard)

Aug 11 16:29:07 <yselkowitz>	anyone had issues bringing encrypted phones and/or laptops across the usa/can border?
Aug 11 16:31:01 <sergiodj>	I just crossed the border twice (round-trip), but I did not have any issues
Aug 11 16:40:43 <fche>	yeah but you're not on the watchlist
Aug 11 16:41:16 <fche>	yaakov, both sets of border police can in principle search through your stuff, and not let you cross if you don't cooperate
Aug 11 16:41:26 <sergiodj>	is yselkowitz on the watchlist?
Aug 11 16:41:32 <fche>	shouldn't he be?
Aug 11 16:41:41 <sergiodj>	I don't know, I'm just asking.
Aug 11 16:41:57 <yselkowitz>	I sure hope not
Aug 11 16:41:59 <sergiodj>	or is it something everybody should know?
Aug 11 16:42:11 <fche>	did you not hear about the unfortunate pretzel incident?
Aug 11 16:42:21 <yselkowitz>	I'm talking about my company laptop, which by policy must be encrypted
Aug 11 16:42:26 <yselkowitz>	pretzel incident?
Aug 11 16:43:27 <fche>	or that time, on the danube, with a butler, in the library, with a lead pipe?
Aug 11 16:45:10 <sergiodj>	obvious, right?
Aug 11 16:58:10 <rgrunber>	fbricon: i miss working on that.
Aug 11 17:03:32 <fbricon>	rgrunber: how is DockerConnectionManager detecting I have a running docker daemon?
Aug 11 17:04:58 <rgrunber>	fbricon: assuming you're running a nightly, there is new functionality to automatically look for some standard locations (eg unix://var/run/docker.sock, 127.0.0.1:2375, anything in environment variables like DOCKER_HOST, ...)
Aug 11 17:05:21 <rgrunber>	.. and add them as connections as opposed to just autofill them ..
Aug 11 17:06:18 <rgrunber>	there's also now an extension point so one could write separate plugins that contribute connection settings.. docker.core will discover them and automatically add them.
Aug 11 17:11:08 <fbricon>	rgrunber: thanks, that explains why my CLI build sees an extra connection, compared to my eclipse-run tests. The former uses a more recent docker tools build

Aug 16 10:52:04 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  hi roland :D
Aug 16 10:52:11 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey
Aug 16 10:52:28 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   im sure xavier will ping you shortly
Aug 16 10:52:29 <strykerawb>	but https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-23011 
Aug 16 10:53:00 <strykerawb>	they want this fixed yesterday ;)   
Aug 16 10:53:24 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: there's a fix for it in the upstream bug on review.. i could push it..
Aug 16 10:56:17 <strykerawb>	if im not annoying you, why is a return of object[]{null} possible?  where is that?
Aug 16 10:57:16 <strykerawb>	"a return of a list with a single null entry is possible."
Aug 16 10:58:16 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: it's not intended, but on windows, the script that checks for some environment variables returns 0 even if it fails.
Aug 16 10:58:51 <strykerawb>	where's that code?
Aug 16 10:59:02 <strykerawb>	i vaguely remember such weird environment variable loading script
Aug 16 10:59:14 <rgrunber>	script.bat is the resource.
Aug 16 11:00:13 <rgrunber>	i mean i should be clear, i haven't confirmed it, but it's the only way to get the behaviour observed. and it makes sense because the other providers do the right thing afaict.
Aug 16 11:01:14 <strykerawb>	[rob@rawbdor resources] (master)$ cat script.bat 
Aug 16 11:01:14 <strykerawb>	@echo off
Aug 16 11:01:14 <strykerawb>	SET DOCKER
Aug 16 11:01:19 <strykerawb>	thats the whole script?
Aug 16 11:02:15 <rgrunber>	yeah that's whats run..
Aug 16 11:03:41 <strykerawb>	wtf does that even do? 
Aug 16 11:04:29 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i figure it prints all env variables containing 'DOCKER' as a term.
Aug 16 11:05:05 <rgrunber>	http://ss64.com/nt/set.html
Aug 16 11:05:14 <rgrunber>	'The SET command invoked with a string (and no equal sign) will display a wildcard list of all matching variables'
Aug 16 11:05:54 <strykerawb>	ok so is the issue that the return value of the process is 0 (ie success) even if no such env vars are found?
Aug 16 11:06:30 <strykerawb>	i wouldn't consider that a bug at all... and whatever code you have that runs this batch script and loads it into a list should account for the fact that it may still provide an empty list
Aug 16 11:06:39 <strykerawb>	where's the code that runs the script?
Aug 16 11:07:12 <rgrunber>	ShellConnectionSettingsProvider
Aug 16 11:07:57 <rgrunber>	i have a fix i'll be pushing in + kicking a build, just need to modify how values are returned.
Aug 16 11:09:10 <strykerawb>	i mean xavier's comments are true.  This method just shouldn't be able to return a list with a null value
Aug 16 11:09:11 <strykerawb>					IDockerConnectionSettings setting = createDockerConnectionSettings(dockerSettings);
Aug 16 11:09:11 <strykerawb>					return Arrays.asList(new IDockerConnectionSettings [] { setting });
Aug 16 11:09:17 <strykerawb>	just check if setting is null first?
Aug 16 11:09:52 <strykerawb>	o
Aug 16 11:09:54 <strykerawb>	your patch does that
Aug 16 11:09:55 <strykerawb>	.........
Aug 16 11:10:09 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: yeah empty list would have solved this.. he wants to also return an empty list..
Aug 16 11:10:33 <rgrunber>	ideally i would have just pushed the smallest change that fixes it, but i don't mind also changing the returns to be proper.
Aug 16 11:10:43 <strykerawb>	eh, null vs empty list, your choice.  the question is who's using that api
Aug 16 11:10:59 <strykerawb>	if the caller is expecting a null or a list with 1 element,   then empty list might cause arrayindex shit 
Aug 16 11:11:12 <strykerawb>	or list index
Aug 16 11:11:14 <strykerawb>	whatever it is
Aug 16 11:11:32 <strykerawb>	so i'd advise you do a call heirarchy and see what the assumptions are here
Aug 16 11:12:04 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i can make all my providers return an empty list.. i really think it should be ok.. but i still need to check nulls because someone could just dump a plugin that uses that extension point and returns null.
Aug 16 11:12:36 <strykerawb>	yep
Aug 16 11:12:43 <strykerawb>	ok seems you've got this under control
Aug 16 11:13:59 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: yeah, for now.. just an fyi i've been swamped with eclipse upstream related work so i've not had much time lately to work on the docker tooling.
Aug 16 11:14:23 <rgrunber>	i guess i mean non-docker upstream work :P
Aug 16 11:14:30 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  what stuff you working on now?   
Aug 16 11:15:05 <rgrunber>	Eclipse Orbit.. moving it over to git and ebr (new way of contributing 3rd party libraries)
Aug 16 11:15:36 <strykerawb>	that sounds like pure work :|

Aug 29 11:15:39 <mbenitez>	#toronto free t-shirts and openshift books across from Lisa's office
Aug 29 11:16:00 <jkang>	nice, thanks!
Aug 29 12:11:18 <fche>	mbenitez, are those openshift books on topic for devtools peeps?
Aug 29 12:12:31 <mbenitez>	what I've seen is an introduction to OpenShift 3, how to install it, configure, get your first apps running
Aug 29 14:17:45 <rgb>	is that the free T-shirts from linuxcon?  the monster ones?
Aug 29 14:18:03 *	rgb only saw XL and larger and declined...
Aug 29 14:19:12 <mbenitez>	yes, the ones from linuxcon
Aug 30 10:31:23 <patrickm>	cookies in the kitchen from Honolulu Cookie Company... the chocolate dipped lilikoi is the best  [http://www.honolulucookie.com/] 
Aug 30 10:34:50 <jkang>	thanks!
Aug 30 11:43:08 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  hi roland :D
Aug 30 11:43:20 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey, any luck ?
Aug 30 11:43:26 <strykerawb>	nope!  :D
Aug 30 11:43:41 <strykerawb>	i mean i got it to work in principle but it still doesn't work ;) 
Aug 30 11:44:06 <strykerawb>	the problem is that most vagrant commands i issue this way end up saying that vagrant is trying to talk to the process as if it was a TTY terminal
Aug 30 11:44:23 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i had some suggestions a little while ago for that.
Aug 30 11:44:39 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i didn't have a chance to try them out..
Aug 30 11:44:59 <rgrunber>	(see the jira)
Aug 30 11:45:39 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   yeah...  we're only using machine-readbale during vagrant service-manager env  calls
Aug 30 11:45:43 <strykerawb>	so thats not relevant 
Aug 30 11:45:59 <strykerawb>	and as for wrapping in a call to bash,  um... this stuff needs to work in windows too
Aug 30 11:46:05 <strykerawb>	so we can't really wrap it in bash 
Aug 30 11:47:34 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   is there an official vagrant syntax to avoid the vagrant commands trying to treat the caller as a tty terminal?
Aug 30 11:47:36 <rgrunber>	can you wrap it in bash for just linux ?.. i could have sworn the vagrant code said something like "if not on windows and stdin.tty is false then error"
Aug 30 11:47:38 <strykerawb>	or is it on a per-command basis? 
Aug 30 11:51:22 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i don't think its possible. vagrant expects the stdin stream to be from a tty when not on windows.
Aug 30 11:51:50 <strykerawb>	that seems absolutely horrible as an assumption
Aug 30 11:51:55 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey so.. can you just try running this on windows and see if it works.. i mean.. it seems like it should.
Aug 30 11:52:17 <rgrunber>	'# We can't ask questions when the output isn't a TTY.'
Aug 30 11:52:27 <strykerawb>	where's that from? link?
Aug 30 11:52:35 <rgrunber>	ah one sec.. vagrant sources
Aug 30 11:53:08 <rgrunber>	https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/lib/vagrant/ui.rb#L161
Aug 30 11:54:48 <strykerawb>	see the thing that gets me is the wording in the error itself
Aug 30 11:54:58 <strykerawb>	Most actions in Vagrant that require a TTY have configuration
Aug 30 11:54:58 <strykerawb>	switches to disable this requirement. Please do that or run Vagrant
Aug 30 11:54:58 <strykerawb>	with TTY.
Aug 30 11:55:23 <strykerawb>	so this begs the question:  is there a way to ask questions without tty and its up to the plugins (ie vagrant service-manager) to implement properly a flag?
Aug 30 11:55:35 <strykerawb>	sorry i mean vagrant registration
Aug 30 11:57:27 <strykerawb>	rgrunber, the reason i ask this question is because,  running a simple java program that reads standard in / standard out doesn't require a TTY terminal
Aug 30 11:57:27 <rgrunber>	do they mean that there are configuration switches to answer the 'question' .. rather than.. there's a way to get the questions without TTY requirement.. i mean this is supposed to be a string message geared towards a user.. not a developer who cares about the internals.
Aug 30 11:57:43 <strykerawb>	so i can't see any technical reason they can't ask questions without a tty
Aug 30 11:57:45 <strykerawb>	it makes no sense
Aug 30 11:59:57 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  who do you think we can ask? =P 
Aug 30 12:00:01 <rgrunber>	maybe they send terminal codes through.. and try to confirm the stream is attached to something that could read them.. seems like it's not their problem but meh.
Aug 30 12:00:55 <rgrunber>	you might get a better answer on devtools (hopefully).. if not i'd love to play around with it because i think this is the right approach.. also you're so close.
Aug 30 12:00:57 <strykerawb>	now again, if i simply open a terminal view, connect to the local host, and send to the terminal's stream "vagrant up" it will work
Aug 30 12:01:08 <strykerawb>	bc then it IS a tty terminal
Aug 30 12:01:17 <strykerawb>	but then i can't get a reference to the IProcess
Aug 30 12:01:35 <strykerawb>	or even a java.lang.Process
Aug 30 12:01:42 <rgrunber>	a stream from bash -i should also be a tty though.. if i could get that to work.
Aug 30 12:02:29 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  do you have time to do some pair coding today or tomorrow? not sure on your current work load
Aug 30 12:02:44 <strykerawb>	i suspect the current impl "just works" in windows already
Aug 30 12:02:49 <strykerawb>	when run as admin
Aug 30 12:03:01 <strykerawb>	but to get it to work on both windows and linux is the hard part
Aug 30 12:04:41 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: so weird for me to be like 'yay it works on windows, that's .. actually the really important case' :(
Aug 30 12:05:28 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i'll be in tomorrow. tbh i just wanna tinker with wrapping the call in bash.. that should let isatty() pass.
