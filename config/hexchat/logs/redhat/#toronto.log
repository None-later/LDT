Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Hello All:
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Just wanted to let you know that after 26 years Brian and I have decided to retire.
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	We are closing Hannahâ€™s at the close of business today, Fri July 29th.
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Wanted to thank all of you for being such loyal customers over the past years
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	The corporation will continue until we wrap up all of our affairs, but
Jul 29 14:32:29 <lisac>	the restaurant and catering will stop today.
Jul 29 14:32:31 <lisac>	We want to wish you all the best in the years to come.
Jul 29 14:32:33 <lisac>	Regards
Jul 29 14:32:35 <lisac>	Ray &  Brian
Jul 29 14:33:49 *	patrickm shall miss their soup 
Jul 29 14:42:47 <patrickm>	lisac: this could be like Seinfeld's Soup Nazi episode where they are giving away soup in any container you bring in... very tempting
Jul 29 14:45:19 <lisac>	only till the end of today..
Jul 29 14:47:53 <patrickm>	lisac: although, nothing topped Mr Chan's wonton soup
Jul 29 14:48:40 <lisac>	patrickm, very true...i think we are showing our age now:-)
Jul 29 14:54:06 <patrickm>	lisac: yeah, i should install astroturf outside my office so i can yell at the interns to "get off my lawn"

Aug 03 10:05:51 <jooho>	lisac: GM I have a question about flight ticket 
Aug 03 10:06:04 <lisac>	sure
Aug 03 10:06:54 <jooho>	last Friday my flight was canceled and I got refund it. how to apply it to expense?
Aug 03 10:07:35 <lisac>	Have you already been reimbursed for the amount?
Aug 03 10:07:42 <jooho>	not yet
Aug 03 10:07:53 <lisac>	have you submitted the expense?
Aug 03 10:08:54 <jooho>	not yet.. I am trying but need to know ...how to apply it... itemize?
Aug 03 10:09:22 <lisac>	is it on a bank of america card or your personal card?
Aug 03 10:11:15 <jooho>	boa
Aug 03 10:12:11 <lisac>	so then both the expense and the reimbursement should show up in your expense statement.
Aug 03 10:12:30 <jooho>	right
Aug 03 10:12:52 <lisac>	I will confirm with Jeanine but I think you just have to state that the flight was cancelled and reimbursed
Aug 03 10:13:50 <jooho>	should i apply both statement?
Aug 03 10:14:30 <lisac>	I am going to send your question into the help page...will let you know when I hear back

Aug 08 11:37:05 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   hi roland :D 
Aug 08 11:37:14 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey
Aug 08 11:37:33 <strykerawb>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-21744
Aug 08 11:37:40 <strykerawb>	we have no idea what to dooooOooOooo
Aug 08 11:38:54 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to pwouters
Aug 08 11:39:53 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   basically we have no API to modify a connection once it's created?
Aug 08 11:41:15 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i believe there should be a way now.. at least we ran into a similar issue when cdk restart meant different certificate so it needed to be reloaded.
Aug 08 11:41:51 <strykerawb>	how did you fix your issue?  is this something i'll need to fix in my code?  or does your code automatically apply?
Aug 08 11:43:03 <strykerawb>	DockerCOnnection doesn't have a setTCPCertPath
Aug 08 11:43:37 <strykerawb>	has a getter but no setter
Aug 08 11:48:24 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: apparently there is a DockerConnectionManager.updateConnection(..) used from EditDockerConnection (wizard)

Aug 11 16:29:07 <yselkowitz>	anyone had issues bringing encrypted phones and/or laptops across the usa/can border?
Aug 11 16:31:01 <sergiodj>	I just crossed the border twice (round-trip), but I did not have any issues
Aug 11 16:40:43 <fche>	yeah but you're not on the watchlist
Aug 11 16:41:16 <fche>	yaakov, both sets of border police can in principle search through your stuff, and not let you cross if you don't cooperate
Aug 11 16:41:26 <sergiodj>	is yselkowitz on the watchlist?
Aug 11 16:41:32 <fche>	shouldn't he be?
Aug 11 16:41:41 <sergiodj>	I don't know, I'm just asking.
Aug 11 16:41:57 <yselkowitz>	I sure hope not
Aug 11 16:41:59 <sergiodj>	or is it something everybody should know?
Aug 11 16:42:11 <fche>	did you not hear about the unfortunate pretzel incident?
Aug 11 16:42:21 <yselkowitz>	I'm talking about my company laptop, which by policy must be encrypted
Aug 11 16:42:26 <yselkowitz>	pretzel incident?
Aug 11 16:43:27 <fche>	or that time, on the danube, with a butler, in the library, with a lead pipe?
Aug 11 16:45:10 <sergiodj>	obvious, right?
Aug 11 16:58:10 <rgrunber>	fbricon: i miss working on that.
Aug 11 17:03:32 <fbricon>	rgrunber: how is DockerConnectionManager detecting I have a running docker daemon?
Aug 11 17:04:58 <rgrunber>	fbricon: assuming you're running a nightly, there is new functionality to automatically look for some standard locations (eg unix://var/run/docker.sock, 127.0.0.1:2375, anything in environment variables like DOCKER_HOST, ...)
Aug 11 17:05:21 <rgrunber>	.. and add them as connections as opposed to just autofill them ..
Aug 11 17:06:18 <rgrunber>	there's also now an extension point so one could write separate plugins that contribute connection settings.. docker.core will discover them and automatically add them.
Aug 11 17:11:08 <fbricon>	rgrunber: thanks, that explains why my CLI build sees an extra connection, compared to my eclipse-run tests. The former uses a more recent docker tools build
