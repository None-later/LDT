Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Hello All:
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Just wanted to let you know that after 26 years Brian and I have decided to retire.
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	We are closing Hannahâ€™s at the close of business today, Fri July 29th.
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	Wanted to thank all of you for being such loyal customers over the past years
Jul 29 14:32:28 <lisac>	The corporation will continue until we wrap up all of our affairs, but
Jul 29 14:32:29 <lisac>	the restaurant and catering will stop today.
Jul 29 14:32:31 <lisac>	We want to wish you all the best in the years to come.
Jul 29 14:32:33 <lisac>	Regards
Jul 29 14:32:35 <lisac>	Ray &  Brian
Jul 29 14:33:49 *	patrickm shall miss their soup 
Jul 29 14:42:47 <patrickm>	lisac: this could be like Seinfeld's Soup Nazi episode where they are giving away soup in any container you bring in... very tempting
Jul 29 14:45:19 <lisac>	only till the end of today..
Jul 29 14:47:53 <patrickm>	lisac: although, nothing topped Mr Chan's wonton soup
Jul 29 14:48:40 <lisac>	patrickm, very true...i think we are showing our age now:-)
Jul 29 14:54:06 <patrickm>	lisac: yeah, i should install astroturf outside my office so i can yell at the interns to "get off my lawn"

Aug 03 10:05:51 <jooho>	lisac: GM I have a question about flight ticket 
Aug 03 10:06:04 <lisac>	sure
Aug 03 10:06:54 <jooho>	last Friday my flight was canceled and I got refund it. how to apply it to expense?
Aug 03 10:07:35 <lisac>	Have you already been reimbursed for the amount?
Aug 03 10:07:42 <jooho>	not yet
Aug 03 10:07:53 <lisac>	have you submitted the expense?
Aug 03 10:08:54 <jooho>	not yet.. I am trying but need to know ...how to apply it... itemize?
Aug 03 10:09:22 <lisac>	is it on a bank of america card or your personal card?
Aug 03 10:11:15 <jooho>	boa
Aug 03 10:12:11 <lisac>	so then both the expense and the reimbursement should show up in your expense statement.
Aug 03 10:12:30 <jooho>	right
Aug 03 10:12:52 <lisac>	I will confirm with Jeanine but I think you just have to state that the flight was cancelled and reimbursed
Aug 03 10:13:50 <jooho>	should i apply both statement?
Aug 03 10:14:30 <lisac>	I am going to send your question into the help page...will let you know when I hear back

Aug 08 11:37:14 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey
Aug 08 11:37:33 <strykerawb>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-21744
Aug 08 11:37:40 <strykerawb>	we have no idea what to dooooOooOooo
Aug 08 11:38:54 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to pwouters
Aug 08 11:39:53 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   basically we have no API to modify a connection once it's created?
Aug 08 11:41:15 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i believe there should be a way now.. at least we ran into a similar issue when cdk restart meant different certificate so it needed to be reloaded.
Aug 08 11:41:51 <strykerawb>	how did you fix your issue?  is this something i'll need to fix in my code?  or does your code automatically apply?
Aug 08 11:43:03 <strykerawb>	DockerCOnnection doesn't have a setTCPCertPath
Aug 08 11:43:37 <strykerawb>	has a getter but no setter
Aug 08 11:48:24 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: apparently there is a DockerConnectionManager.updateConnection(..) used from EditDockerConnection (wizard)

Aug 11 16:29:07 <yselkowitz>	anyone had issues bringing encrypted phones and/or laptops across the usa/can border?
Aug 11 16:31:01 <sergiodj>	I just crossed the border twice (round-trip), but I did not have any issues
Aug 11 16:40:43 <fche>	yeah but you're not on the watchlist
Aug 11 16:41:16 <fche>	yaakov, both sets of border police can in principle search through your stuff, and not let you cross if you don't cooperate
Aug 11 16:41:26 <sergiodj>	is yselkowitz on the watchlist?
Aug 11 16:41:32 <fche>	shouldn't he be?
Aug 11 16:41:41 <sergiodj>	I don't know, I'm just asking.
Aug 11 16:41:57 <yselkowitz>	I sure hope not
Aug 11 16:41:59 <sergiodj>	or is it something everybody should know?
Aug 11 16:42:11 <fche>	did you not hear about the unfortunate pretzel incident?
Aug 11 16:42:21 <yselkowitz>	I'm talking about my company laptop, which by policy must be encrypted
Aug 11 16:42:26 <yselkowitz>	pretzel incident?
Aug 11 16:43:27 <fche>	or that time, on the danube, with a butler, in the library, with a lead pipe?
Aug 11 16:45:10 <sergiodj>	obvious, right?
Aug 11 16:58:10 <rgrunber>	fbricon: i miss working on that.
Aug 11 17:03:32 <fbricon>	rgrunber: how is DockerConnectionManager detecting I have a running docker daemon?
Aug 11 17:04:58 <rgrunber>	fbricon: assuming you're running a nightly, there is new functionality to automatically look for some standard locations (eg unix://var/run/docker.sock, 127.0.0.1:2375, anything in environment variables like DOCKER_HOST, ...)
Aug 11 17:05:21 <rgrunber>	.. and add them as connections as opposed to just autofill them ..
Aug 11 17:06:18 <rgrunber>	there's also now an extension point so one could write separate plugins that contribute connection settings.. docker.core will discover them and automatically add them.
Aug 11 17:11:08 <fbricon>	rgrunber: thanks, that explains why my CLI build sees an extra connection, compared to my eclipse-run tests. The former uses a more recent docker tools build

Aug 16 10:52:04 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  hi roland :D
Aug 16 10:52:11 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey
Aug 16 10:52:28 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   im sure xavier will ping you shortly
Aug 16 10:52:29 <strykerawb>	but https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-23011 
Aug 16 10:53:00 <strykerawb>	they want this fixed yesterday ;)   
Aug 16 10:53:24 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: there's a fix for it in the upstream bug on review.. i could push it..
Aug 16 10:56:17 <strykerawb>	if im not annoying you, why is a return of object[]{null} possible?  where is that?
Aug 16 10:57:16 <strykerawb>	"a return of a list with a single null entry is possible."
Aug 16 10:58:16 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: it's not intended, but on windows, the script that checks for some environment variables returns 0 even if it fails.
Aug 16 10:58:51 <strykerawb>	where's that code?
Aug 16 10:59:02 <strykerawb>	i vaguely remember such weird environment variable loading script
Aug 16 10:59:14 <rgrunber>	script.bat is the resource.
Aug 16 11:00:13 <rgrunber>	i mean i should be clear, i haven't confirmed it, but it's the only way to get the behaviour observed. and it makes sense because the other providers do the right thing afaict.
Aug 16 11:01:14 <strykerawb>	[rob@rawbdor resources] (master)$ cat script.bat 
Aug 16 11:01:14 <strykerawb>	@echo off
Aug 16 11:01:14 <strykerawb>	SET DOCKER
Aug 16 11:01:19 <strykerawb>	thats the whole script?
Aug 16 11:02:15 <rgrunber>	yeah that's whats run..
Aug 16 11:03:41 <strykerawb>	wtf does that even do? 
Aug 16 11:04:29 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i figure it prints all env variables containing 'DOCKER' as a term.
Aug 16 11:05:05 <rgrunber>	http://ss64.com/nt/set.html
Aug 16 11:05:14 <rgrunber>	'The SET command invoked with a string (and no equal sign) will display a wildcard list of all matching variables'
Aug 16 11:05:54 <strykerawb>	ok so is the issue that the return value of the process is 0 (ie success) even if no such env vars are found?
Aug 16 11:06:30 <strykerawb>	i wouldn't consider that a bug at all... and whatever code you have that runs this batch script and loads it into a list should account for the fact that it may still provide an empty list
Aug 16 11:06:39 <strykerawb>	where's the code that runs the script?
Aug 16 11:07:12 <rgrunber>	ShellConnectionSettingsProvider
Aug 16 11:07:57 <rgrunber>	i have a fix i'll be pushing in + kicking a build, just need to modify how values are returned.
Aug 16 11:09:10 <strykerawb>	i mean xavier's comments are true.  This method just shouldn't be able to return a list with a null value
Aug 16 11:09:11 <strykerawb>					IDockerConnectionSettings setting = createDockerConnectionSettings(dockerSettings);
Aug 16 11:09:11 <strykerawb>					return Arrays.asList(new IDockerConnectionSettings [] { setting });
Aug 16 11:09:17 <strykerawb>	just check if setting is null first?
Aug 16 11:09:52 <strykerawb>	o
Aug 16 11:09:54 <strykerawb>	your patch does that
Aug 16 11:09:55 <strykerawb>	.........
Aug 16 11:10:09 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: yeah empty list would have solved this.. he wants to also return an empty list..
Aug 16 11:10:33 <rgrunber>	ideally i would have just pushed the smallest change that fixes it, but i don't mind also changing the returns to be proper.
Aug 16 11:10:43 <strykerawb>	eh, null vs empty list, your choice.  the question is who's using that api
Aug 16 11:10:59 <strykerawb>	if the caller is expecting a null or a list with 1 element,   then empty list might cause arrayindex shit 
Aug 16 11:11:12 <strykerawb>	or list index
Aug 16 11:11:14 <strykerawb>	whatever it is
Aug 16 11:11:32 <strykerawb>	so i'd advise you do a call heirarchy and see what the assumptions are here
Aug 16 11:12:04 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i can make all my providers return an empty list.. i really think it should be ok.. but i still need to check nulls because someone could just dump a plugin that uses that extension point and returns null.
Aug 16 11:12:36 <strykerawb>	yep
Aug 16 11:12:43 <strykerawb>	ok seems you've got this under control
Aug 16 11:13:59 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: yeah, for now.. just an fyi i've been swamped with eclipse upstream related work so i've not had much time lately to work on the docker tooling.
Aug 16 11:14:23 <rgrunber>	i guess i mean non-docker upstream work :P
Aug 16 11:14:30 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  what stuff you working on now?   
Aug 16 11:15:05 <rgrunber>	Eclipse Orbit.. moving it over to git and ebr (new way of contributing 3rd party libraries)
Aug 16 11:15:36 <strykerawb>	that sounds like pure work :|

Aug 29 11:15:39 <mbenitez>	#toronto free t-shirts and openshift books across from Lisa's office
Aug 29 11:16:00 <jkang>	nice, thanks!
Aug 29 12:11:18 <fche>	mbenitez, are those openshift books on topic for devtools peeps?
Aug 29 12:12:31 <mbenitez>	what I've seen is an introduction to OpenShift 3, how to install it, configure, get your first apps running
Aug 29 14:17:45 <rgb>	is that the free T-shirts from linuxcon?  the monster ones?
Aug 29 14:18:03 *	rgb only saw XL and larger and declined...
Aug 29 14:19:12 <mbenitez>	yes, the ones from linuxcon
Aug 30 10:31:23 <patrickm>	cookies in the kitchen from Honolulu Cookie Company... the chocolate dipped lilikoi is the best  [http://www.honolulucookie.com/] 
Aug 30 10:34:50 <jkang>	thanks!
Aug 30 11:43:08 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  hi roland :D
Aug 30 11:43:20 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey, any luck ?
Aug 30 11:43:26 <strykerawb>	nope!  :D
Aug 30 11:43:41 <strykerawb>	i mean i got it to work in principle but it still doesn't work ;) 
Aug 30 11:44:06 <strykerawb>	the problem is that most vagrant commands i issue this way end up saying that vagrant is trying to talk to the process as if it was a TTY terminal
Aug 30 11:44:23 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i had some suggestions a little while ago for that.
Aug 30 11:44:39 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i didn't have a chance to try them out..
Aug 30 11:44:59 <rgrunber>	(see the jira)
Aug 30 11:45:39 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   yeah...  we're only using machine-readbale during vagrant service-manager env  calls
Aug 30 11:45:43 <strykerawb>	so thats not relevant 
Aug 30 11:45:59 <strykerawb>	and as for wrapping in a call to bash,  um... this stuff needs to work in windows too
Aug 30 11:46:05 <strykerawb>	so we can't really wrap it in bash 
Aug 30 11:47:34 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,   is there an official vagrant syntax to avoid the vagrant commands trying to treat the caller as a tty terminal?
Aug 30 11:47:36 <rgrunber>	can you wrap it in bash for just linux ?.. i could have sworn the vagrant code said something like "if not on windows and stdin.tty is false then error"
Aug 30 11:47:38 <strykerawb>	or is it on a per-command basis? 
Aug 30 11:51:22 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i don't think its possible. vagrant expects the stdin stream to be from a tty when not on windows.
Aug 30 11:51:50 <strykerawb>	that seems absolutely horrible as an assumption
Aug 30 11:51:55 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hey so.. can you just try running this on windows and see if it works.. i mean.. it seems like it should.
Aug 30 11:52:17 <rgrunber>	'# We can't ask questions when the output isn't a TTY.'
Aug 30 11:52:27 <strykerawb>	where's that from? link?
Aug 30 11:52:35 <rgrunber>	ah one sec.. vagrant sources
Aug 30 11:53:08 <rgrunber>	https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/lib/vagrant/ui.rb#L161
Aug 30 11:54:48 <strykerawb>	see the thing that gets me is the wording in the error itself
Aug 30 11:54:58 <strykerawb>	Most actions in Vagrant that require a TTY have configuration
Aug 30 11:54:58 <strykerawb>	switches to disable this requirement. Please do that or run Vagrant
Aug 30 11:54:58 <strykerawb>	with TTY.
Aug 30 11:55:23 <strykerawb>	so this begs the question:  is there a way to ask questions without tty and its up to the plugins (ie vagrant service-manager) to implement properly a flag?
Aug 30 11:55:35 <strykerawb>	sorry i mean vagrant registration
Aug 30 11:57:27 <strykerawb>	rgrunber, the reason i ask this question is because,  running a simple java program that reads standard in / standard out doesn't require a TTY terminal
Aug 30 11:57:27 <rgrunber>	do they mean that there are configuration switches to answer the 'question' .. rather than.. there's a way to get the questions without TTY requirement.. i mean this is supposed to be a string message geared towards a user.. not a developer who cares about the internals.
Aug 30 11:57:43 <strykerawb>	so i can't see any technical reason they can't ask questions without a tty
Aug 30 11:57:45 <strykerawb>	it makes no sense
Aug 30 11:59:57 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  who do you think we can ask? =P 
Aug 30 12:00:01 <rgrunber>	maybe they send terminal codes through.. and try to confirm the stream is attached to something that could read them.. seems like it's not their problem but meh.
Aug 30 12:00:55 <rgrunber>	you might get a better answer on devtools (hopefully).. if not i'd love to play around with it because i think this is the right approach.. also you're so close.
Aug 30 12:00:57 <strykerawb>	now again, if i simply open a terminal view, connect to the local host, and send to the terminal's stream "vagrant up" it will work
Aug 30 12:01:08 <strykerawb>	bc then it IS a tty terminal
Aug 30 12:01:17 <strykerawb>	but then i can't get a reference to the IProcess
Aug 30 12:01:35 <strykerawb>	or even a java.lang.Process
Aug 30 12:01:42 <rgrunber>	a stream from bash -i should also be a tty though.. if i could get that to work.
Aug 30 12:02:29 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  do you have time to do some pair coding today or tomorrow? not sure on your current work load
Aug 30 12:02:44 <strykerawb>	i suspect the current impl "just works" in windows already
Aug 30 12:02:49 <strykerawb>	when run as admin
Aug 30 12:03:01 <strykerawb>	but to get it to work on both windows and linux is the hard part
Aug 30 12:04:41 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: so weird for me to be like 'yay it works on windows, that's .. actually the really important case' :(
Aug 30 12:05:28 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i'll be in tomorrow. tbh i just wanna tinker with wrapping the call in bash.. that should let isatty() pass.

Sep 01 12:00:00 <patrickm>	i have 4 of the "Code is My Spirit Animal" tshirts left... size men's large... if you want one [even if you have one already] they'll be on the cabinet in my office
Sep 01 12:02:22 <patrickm>	stooke: do you take a mens large?
Sep 01 12:17:13 <rgb>	patrickm: nice SRED numbers!
Sep 01 12:21:06 <patrickm>	rgb: indeed.  it's a relatively small effort [spread over many engineers] that really makes a bottom line difference
Sep 01 14:03:42 <rgb>	patrickm: what's the average percentage of salary saved?
Sep 01 14:04:03 <rgb>	I'm guessing somewhere between 10% and 30%?
Sep 01 14:25:39 <patrickm>	rgb: yes, in that range... total compensation as well, just not straight salary
Sep 01 14:26:37 *	patrickm doesn't see the formulation... i just received the final numbers [federal and provincial]
Sep 01 14:47:43 <patrickm>	lisac: is that cake for any special reason or is it a consume at will?
Sep 01 14:53:15 <rgrunber>	it's probably a social experiement in how long an unopened cake can remain that way in our office.
Sep 01 15:00:54 <patrickm>	rgrunber: i opened them
Sep 01 15:04:44 <steveg>	it's a good policy
Sep 01 15:04:47 <steveg>	when in doubt cake
Sep 01 15:05:10 <patrickm>	steveg: my policy is simpler... "cake"
Sep 01 15:06:16 <rgrunber>	ACCEPT *
Sep 02 10:52:39 <rgrunber>	PSA: careful when using the sink in the kitchen. that little rod that acts as the handle seems to have come off (again?)
Sep 02 10:53:16 <lisac>	Plan on buying a new tap next week...that should solve the problem:-)
Sep 02 10:53:49 <steveg>	i for one welcome our new tap overlord
Sep 02 10:54:42 <rgrunber>	steveg: i guess you could even say we are ruled by some.. number of taps greater than 1.. a grouping of taps.. a ... tapset.
Sep 02 10:55:15 <rgrunber>	.. SystemTap!!
Sep 02 10:55:40 <lisac>	we will have to rename the sink
Sep 02 10:56:17 <rgrunber>	Red Hat SystemTap Online
Sep 02 10:56:30 <rgrunber>	Enterprise Edition
Sep 02 10:56:34 <fche>	with containers
Sep 02 10:56:41 <fche>	that open
Sep 02 10:56:42 <rgrunber>	v3
Sep 02 10:56:43 <fche>	or may shift
Sep 02 10:56:49 <steveg>	not in the sink, containers go in the dishwasher
Sep 02 10:56:56 <fche>	or may the wrath of matt be upon you

Sep 07 14:31:38 <mbenitez>	lisac, thanks for the msg
Sep 07 14:38:27 <dbhole>	lisac: thanks for the heads up, got a text as well
Sep 07 17:49:44 <patrickm>	sweet, sweet hydro
Sep 07 17:50:09 <omajid_away>	glad to hear you have power now :)
Sep 07 17:51:49 <patrickm>	yeah, outage in etobicoke... 5000+ customers hit
Sep 07 17:51:59 <patrickm>	good times on a hot day ;)
Sep 07 17:52:23 <omajid_away>	yikes...
Sep 09 09:25:50 <cdrage>	omg, there's dozens of us! i just joined this channel
Sep 09 09:25:52 <cdrage>	what up from waterloo
Sep 09 09:26:31 <jkang>	morning :)
Sep 09 09:26:42 <dcheung>	you discovered our super secret channel
Sep 09 09:26:46 <yzhang>	Greetings fellow Canadian
Sep 09 09:26:49 <yzhang>	minus dcheung 
Sep 09 09:27:00 <dcheung>	yzhang--
Sep 09 09:27:06 <yzhang>	dcheung++
Sep 09 09:27:07 <cdrage>	hahahah, i just found it while trying to setup kerberos, saw a comment about #toronto channel
Sep 09 09:27:30 <steveg>	this is how it ends isnt it
Sep 09 09:31:47 <patrickm>	steveg: i haven't been down to westford in a month or two... are you still down there constantly?
Sep 09 09:32:15 <steveg>	not in a while
Sep 09 09:32:20 <steveg>	im going to brno on sunday
Sep 09 09:32:26 <steveg>	and was in sweden last week
Sep 09 09:32:27 <steveg>	lol
Sep 09 09:32:32 <steveg>	patrickm, ^^
Sep 09 09:32:51 <patrickm>	steveg: niiiiice
Sep 09 09:33:02 <steveg>	i probably havent been in westford since some time in june or july, but that was like 3 weeks in a row
Sep 09 09:33:13 *	patrickm goes over to steveg's desk to steal his stapler 
Sep 09 09:33:33 <steveg>	gotta work out how to put ye old openstack thingy in them container-roos
Sep 09 09:34:04 <steveg>	i dont have a stapler but you can definitely steal my books :P
Sep 09 09:34:34 <patrickm>	steveg: pffffft... openstack, that's for hipsters!  but that would explain your fondness for skinny jeans and old timey moustaches 
Sep 09 09:36:08 <patrickm>	steveg: but on a more serious side, there is an OpenStack Day in Montreal [November 22]... are you heading to that?
Sep 09 09:36:46 <patrickm>	i was thinking about taking a road trip for that
Sep 09 09:39:10 <steveg>	patrickm, unclear atm
Sep 09 09:39:21 <steveg>	patrickm, i havent specifically put my hand up but probably will
Sep 09 09:40:20 <patrickm>	steveg: fair enough, let me know
Sep 09 11:28:28 *	rgb wonders if steveg also has a fixie...
Sep 09 12:22:25 *	alanm wonders if rgb wants to add more wheels to said fixie 
Sep 09 12:38:14 *	rgb wants an original fixie, aka a 60" penny-farthing.
Sep 09 13:49:22 *	alanm wonders about attempting a track stand on a penny-farthing... it's a loonnggg way down to the ground.
Sep 09 14:21:02 *	rgb has ridden a penny-farthing several times and quite enjoyed the sensation, but has otherwise no interest in owning a matching-wheel chain-driven fixie...
Sep 09 14:24:35 *	alanm has never wanted a fixie. I'd rather get a cyclo-cross bike that I can take up to the cottage with me and use it as a rain bike when I'm in town
Sep 09 15:05:24 <strykerawb>	rgrunber, please kill me
Sep 09 15:05:27 <strykerawb>	i'll provide the weapon
Sep 09 15:05:34 <strykerawb>	i'll instruct my family to dispose of the weapon afterwards too
Sep 09 15:38:35 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: whatsup?
Sep 09 15:38:54 <strykerawb>	so was testing my QE's complaints of our nice terminal solution on windows
Sep 09 15:39:09 *	alanm suggests that a barrel of napalm(TM) works well
Sep 09 15:39:11 <strykerawb>	first problem was easy to solve:  he said when he typed intput it didnt show.  easy fix, boolean somewhere. 
Sep 09 15:39:19 <strykerawb>	however.........
Sep 09 15:39:29 <strykerawb>	vagrant's output is something like this
Sep 09 15:39:41 <strykerawb>	Do you want to register the CDK? [y/n]:   {you type here}
Sep 09 15:39:47 <strykerawb>	so i type y,  enter.  and wait
Sep 09 15:39:54 <strykerawb>	nothing.   i press enter again.  then it says
Sep 09 15:39:56 <strykerawb>	"Username:  "
Sep 09 15:40:06 <strykerawb>	i type "rst" and it cuts me off, somehow recognizing my 2nd enter 
Sep 09 15:40:09 <strykerawb>	and says "Password:  " 
Sep 09 15:40:29 <strykerawb>	i type a password, press enter,  nothing.   Press enter a 2nd time,  craps out again in similar fashion
Sep 09 15:41:01 <strykerawb>	so then i thought well this is really weird, so instead of running "vagrant up" i had it run "java SimpleIO"  (some shtity main class i made that does i/o... asks questions, you type response, etc)
Sep 09 15:41:04 <strykerawb>	worked 100% as expected
Sep 09 15:41:07 <strykerawb>	fails 100% with vagrant
Sep 09 15:41:09 <strykerawb>	kill me
Sep 09 15:41:11 <strykerawb>	with fire
Sep 09 15:41:14 <strykerawb>	napalm even 
Sep 09 15:41:23 <strykerawb>	buy it from alanm .... he sounds like the kinda guy with a stockpile
Sep 09 15:41:38 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: so the bug is with vagrant, and specifically on windows ?
Sep 09 15:42:05 <strykerawb>	i would assume thats the situation. i mean i haven't tested 30 or 40 scenarios or anything
Sep 09 15:42:19 <strykerawb>	im not sure what other windows commands ask for user input
Sep 09 15:42:26 <strykerawb>	so i can test in other frames
Sep 09 15:43:19 <alanm>	it's only a suggestion ... I was going to suggest ammonium nitrate (fertilizer) and some dynamite but there are laws about that sort of thing.
Sep 09 15:43:42 <strykerawb>	depends on the country
Sep 09 15:43:43 <rgrunber>	alanm: Rob doesn't get hung up on these 'laws' you speak of.
Sep 09 15:44:17 <rgrunber>	i think you'd probably know more if you could see the raw stream in the linux case, and the windows case..
Sep 09 15:44:17 <strykerawb>	if you're about to kill yourself, what right do mortal men have to stop me from doing it in a blaze of glory?
Sep 09 15:45:01 <stooke>	strykerawb i know nothing  of what you're trying to solve with vagrant, is it a Java util, and could it be using the jline library to do console input?
Sep 09 15:45:24 <dcheung>	also there's aesh
Sep 09 15:45:34 <dcheung>	but vagrant is for vm setup
Sep 09 15:45:36 <strykerawb>	vagrant itself is a VM-runner basically.   runs virtualbox or others... has plugins, etc.   
Sep 09 15:45:47 <strykerawb>	all in ruby i believe
Sep 09 15:48:15 <jkang>	supposedly targeted at consistent dev environments for a team to reduce cases of "works on my machine"
Sep 09 15:49:03 <rgrunber>	jkang: you're supposedly lacks any element of sarcasm.
Sep 09 15:49:06 <rgrunber>	your*
Sep 09 15:49:30 <alanm>	how about a one way shipping box to Redmond ? 
Sep 09 15:49:56 <jkang>	oh yes no sarcasm at all :D though I admit it's a nice concept
Sep 09 15:50:22 <jkang>	and "works on my machine but not yours" does happen more than enough to be annoying
Sep 09 15:50:40 <alanm>	haha
Sep 09 15:50:40 <strykerawb>	utopia is also a nice concept
Sep 09 15:50:53 <alanm>	so what else is new ?
Sep 09 15:51:12 <strykerawb>	this is obama's fault
Sep 09 15:51:14 <strykerawb>	thanks obama
Sep 09 15:51:17 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: i still think the answer is in the vagrant code somewhere.. and in seeing the raw stream.. might bring some clues.
Sep 09 15:51:24 <strykerawb>	(sorry, im muhrikan, interoping in your socialist paradise)
Sep 09 15:51:29 *	alanm will leave you young'uns to figure things out.
Sep 09 15:51:33 <strykerawb>	interloping
Sep 09 15:59:52 <patrickm>	fche: which engineer is planning on giving the FSOSS talk?
Sep 09 16:00:12 <fche>	I gather csanting mainly
Sep 09 16:00:36 <fche>	may his soul survive unscathed
Sep 09 16:01:36 <patrickm>	godspeed csanting
Sep 09 16:04:32 <fche>	we might want to pre-reserve a cemetery plot, just in case
Sep 09 16:05:06 <alanm>	what ? no exorcisms or burning at the stake ? That's no fun
Sep 09 16:07:43 <rgb>	if you are talking about burning, an urn takes a lot less space than a coffin...
Sep 09 16:08:05 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: fwiw if i find some spare cycles i wouldn't mind having a look.. although step 1 would literally be get my hands on a windows box..
Sep 09 16:08:33 <strykerawb>	and then getting vagrant... and cdk... and lots of other stuff up ;) 
Sep 09 16:08:38 <fche>	rgrunber is trying out for defenestration
Sep 09 16:08:50 <strykerawb>	CDK:  Coder Defenestration Kit
Sep 09 16:08:58 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hah.. don't wanna think about it..
Sep 09 16:09:21 <strykerawb>	the europeans all know that word... apparently there was a war called the defenestration war or something
Sep 09 16:09:36 <strykerawb>	The Defenestrations of Prague
Sep 09 16:10:46 <alanm>	lol
Sep 09 16:13:03 <rgrunber>	i've heard it's a great city.. should definitely add it on my list to .. czech it out.
Sep 09 16:17:13 <strykerawb>	i hear its a great place to defenestrate people and things
Sep 09 16:32:38 <alanm>	just remember to keep that surplus T-72 tank in the barn where it belongs
Sep 09 16:43:57 *	rgb plans to visit prague after devconf.cz with luiz.
Sep 09 16:45:49 *	rgb being francophone loves the word defenestration
Sep 09 16:55:28 *	rgb discovers there was more than one defenestration in prague!

Sep 12 15:53:14 *	patrickm was just looking at the Red Hat Course selection.... RHCSA offered in Toronto Oct 31-Nov 04 and Jan 30-Feb 03
Sep 12 15:53:46 <patrickm>	and they are close by... 40 Eglinton Ave East
Sep 12 15:54:38 <patrickm>	[interns are allowed as well]
Sep 13 03:26:11 <steveg>	patrickm, i actually think they have a kiosk at exit certified now as well so if people just want to do the exam that is an option too
Sep 13 07:44:35 <patrickm>	steveg: good to know, thanks
Sep 13 12:05:44 <patrickm>	dbhole, lberk, thauser|gym: did you guys get the  Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)  blast from UofT? 
Sep 13 12:06:46 <dbhole>	patrickm: yeah, got one a few min ago
Sep 13 12:07:21 <patrickm>	dbhole: ok, as long as one of you guys got it
Sep 13 12:23:51 <lberk>	patrickm: any change in our end of things in regards to recruiting from that program? (iirc the 15K stipend from the program itself helps)
Sep 13 12:25:16 <patrickm>	lberk: that's for you to decide... part of the internship co-ordination is investigating new opportunities  
Sep 13 12:26:13 <lberk>	will do
Sep 13 13:51:41 <patrickm>	lisac: is there a specific one for Canada?  This one, while claiming to be for North America, seems to be US centric -> https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1032763

Sep 14 12:28:30 <strykerawb>	rgrunber, whatcha doin today? ;) 
Sep 14 12:29:35 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: not sure if i'll have time to look into it.. we'll see.. it's on my list.
Sep 14 12:30:33 <rgrunber>	i did set up a windows box with vagrant+virtualbox so should be ready once we download devstudio + your plugin.
Sep 14 13:45:39 <chrisphi_>	FYI: Down the street (140 Eglinton Ave, where Filthy McNasty's was?) is now a branch of  "La Carnitas" which has good taco's etc . I regularly eat  at the one at 501 College and recommend it (of course they have good beers too... 8-)
Sep 14 13:46:13 <lisac>	chrisphi_, and ice cream next door....
Sep 14 13:46:23 <chrisphi_>	{thats 140 Eglinton Ave East....}
Sep 14 13:46:29 <chrisphi_>	:-)
Sep 14 13:49:20 <dbhole>	chrisphi_: no takeout though :(
Sep 14 13:50:35 <chrisphi_>	dbhole: Hmm maybe they will figure that out if enough people suggest it ;-)
Sep 14 13:50:41 <dbhole>	:)
Sep 14 13:53:15 <dcheung>	I think lisac mises the icecream
Sep 14 13:53:19 <dcheung>	misses
Sep 14 15:19:13 <strykerawb>	rgrunber,  ping
Sep 14 15:19:21 <strykerawb>	found out CDT has a "Spawner" class which extends Process 
Sep 14 15:19:27 <rgrunber>	hey
Sep 14 15:19:28 <strykerawb>	launches commands through a PTY
Sep 14 15:19:38 <strykerawb>	pty = pseudo-tty
Sep 14 15:19:48 <strykerawb>	i'll try that solution i guess 
Sep 14 15:19:52 <strykerawb>	but it adds a dep on us to CDT
Sep 14 15:19:56 <strykerawb>	worst case i can copy the class i guess
Sep 14 15:20:16 <rgrunber>	strykerawb: hmm so using that instead of runtime.getruntime() you mean ?
Sep 14 15:20:23 <strykerawb>	yes
Sep 14 15:20:30 <rgrunber>	worth a shot.. 
Sep 14 15:20:57 <rgrunber>	assuming the problem is is vagrant being unable to detect certain things from java-side.
Sep 14 15:22:35 <strykerawb>	the problem is vagrant just thinks its talking to a tty
Sep 14 15:22:40 <strykerawb>	vagrant really should fix their side
Sep 14 15:22:47 <strykerawb>	there's no reason they need to treat it as a pty/tty
Sep 14 15:22:50 <rgrunber>	and it moves the point of failure to cdt's win32 x86_64 code.
Sep 14 15:22:52 <rgrunber>	:P..
Sep 14 15:35:40 <patrickm>	dcheung: are you suggesting ice cream tomorrow?
Sep 14 15:36:24 <lisac>	patrickm, great....your turn to make it:-)
Sep 14 15:37:16 <patrickm>	lisac: i'll give it a go... as long as i don't have to clean up ;)
Sep 14 15:37:48 *	patrickm can be more "experimental and creative" that way
Sep 14 15:38:07 <lisac>	patrickm, oh NO....that is all part of it:-)
Sep 14 15:38:45 <patrickm>	lisac: then, alas, I must decline due to your restrictions on my creative freedom
Sep 14 15:39:58 <lisac>	patrickm, i did not restrict that....
Sep 14 15:45:33 *	patrickm will just bring in $10 for Sweet Jesus instead
Sep 14 20:58:16 *	rgb would make ice cream if he were around to do it...

Sep 22 10:52:49 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: https://post-office.corp.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo :P
Sep 22 10:54:42 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, there are 4611 lists out there.
Sep 22 10:54:59 <rgrunber>	https://post-office.corp.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/brno-ddr-list
Sep 22 10:56:09 <rgrunber>	i honestly never gave too much of a thought about memo-list having tech-list topics until that thread.. and then said yeah..
Sep 22 16:10:19 <patrickm>	just got a call from the Mothership [Raleigh], apparently the round phone in the video conference room on the Sales side is unplugged.  
Sep 22 16:11:11 <patrickm>	i just got home to beat the traffic, if there is someone in the office that could wander over and plug it in, Raleigh would appreciate it
Sep 22 16:11:19 <patrickm>	[and let me know]
Sep 22 16:13:17 <jwellman>	Someone is in there filming a presentation; I'll check in again in a little bit
Sep 22 16:13:43 <patrickm>	jwellman: thanks
Sep 22 16:14:13 <jwellman>	np
Sep 22 17:26:58 <patrickm>	jwellman: did you complete your task?
Sep 23 11:52:29 <fnasser>	Highlander, Hi Andrew, it is Friday, maybe it is time for us to educate us a bit on the tax implications of the ESPP participation?  :-)
Sep 23 11:53:13 <fnasser>	Highlander, When is the tax over that percentage taken?  Is that percentage taken after tax in the payroll?
Sep 23 13:11:01 <Highlander>	fnasser:  THe way this normnally works :  whatever the market price is when you get the shares minus whatever you paid for them is charged to you as a taxable benefit.
Sep 23 13:11:35 <Highlander>	so you'll pay your normal tax rate on that difference.     I havent seen any documentation on our plan, but Id be surprised if they did it any other way
Sep 23 13:12:54 <Highlander>	they may use different words for the benefit, but it's likely to be that way.
Sep 23 13:14:42 <Highlander>	Karen was in IBM's ESPP for a while and it boiled down to that, althogh they did some funny calculations every pay cheque that I never really understood so that you didnt get a bit tax hit twice a year on your paycheque when they were issued for the benefit.  
Sep 23 13:24:25 <rgb>	I know it isn't open until Monday, but has anyone got any idea what to put in username/password or SSN in "register now"?
Sep 23 13:36:21 <rgb>	sorry, under "outside US", "participant number"
Sep 23 13:49:15 <fnasser>	Highlander, That makes sense at the end, but how does it affect the tax in each pay date -- that amount, lets say 10% was stil earninsg, so subject to tax right?
Sep 23 13:50:08 <fnasser>	Highlander, So we pay tax on the money we "saved" on each paycheck, then pay a bit more on the profit we made by buying below marked when the stocks are bought every 6 months
Sep 23 13:50:48 <fnasser>	Highlander, In other words, the 10% wil come from your net pay each payroll
Sep 23 13:50:52 <Highlander>	that I don't know.     I expect you'll pay tax on "income" of 15% of your deduction amount since that is guaranteed.
Sep 23 13:51:18 <Highlander>	maybe they amortize the rest over the next 6 months or do it all at once at 6 month, although that woudl siurprise me.
Sep 23 13:51:32 <fnasser>	Like 10% of the gross is taken from the net 
Sep 23 13:51:56 <Highlander>	I never did figure IBMs out.. they may have been "guessing" based on the current stock price.  not sure. It was rarelty the sameamount
Sep 23 13:52:46 <fnasser>	Highlander, I guess there is only oe way to find out -- try it for 6 months
Sep 23 13:53:16 <fnasser>	Highlander, I wonder if with the taxes and all it is still worth of "saving" this way
Sep 23 13:53:40 <fnasser>	Highlander, The profits increase if the market goes up but then the stock funds will also go up
Sep 23 13:53:51 <Highlander>	they know you will get at least 15% of a benefit from your deducated amount, so they will likely tax you on at least that amount each cheque I would think
Sep 23 13:54:20 <fnasser>	Above the regular tax on salary income?
Sep 23 13:54:21 <Highlander>	its like RSUs.. you only see half of what the benefit is :-P
Sep 23 13:54:30 <fnasser>	That is where the money is comming from anyway
Sep 23 13:54:33 <Highlander>	it ought to be taxed like regular salary
Sep 23 13:55:30 <Highlander>	when you get a taxable benefit, that number is added to your salary for that paycheque, and the federal tax tables are used on that number for your deducation that cheque
Sep 23 13:55:37 <fnasser>	Highlander, We have to decide to take part and how much next week, and I am still not fully convinced it is worth doing it
Sep 23 13:55:45 <Highlander>	so its effectively taxing you like a salary increase :-P
Sep 23 13:56:05 <fnasser>	Highlander, Shouldn't it be capital gain?  Lower tax 
Sep 23 13:56:20 <Highlander>	well, in theory your after tax profit is guatranteed to be at least 7.5% of whatever you put in :-)
Sep 23 13:56:20 <fnasser>	Highlander, Well, at least any gains above the 15% is capital gain
Sep 23 13:56:50 <fnasser>	Highlander, So a savings account with a 6 month return of 7.5% ?
Sep 23 13:56:58 <fnasser>	after tax
Sep 23 13:57:01 <Highlander>	depends on whetehr they categorize it as a stock benefit. if they do, then you'll pay even less tax.. but IM not convinced.  gains on RSus are taxed at your salary rate
Sep 23 13:57:32 <Highlander>	I dont think capital gains will come into it until after you own the stock
Sep 23 13:57:53 <fnasser>	Highlander, but whatever I make when I sell the RSU stock I've got is taxed as capita gain (or los)
Sep 23 13:57:55 <fnasser>	loss
Sep 23 13:58:11 <Highlander>	yes. once you own it, its all capital gain/loss
Sep 23 13:58:37 <fnasser>	Highlander, Ah, that is true, so the percentage above 15% is still before I got the stocks
Sep 23 13:58:44 <fnasser>	in the case of the ESPP
Sep 23 13:58:45 <Highlander>	but they tax you on it before they issue it to you.. so its at salary rate.  I would expect the ESPP to be similar.. but we can hope not. 
Sep 23 13:59:23 <fnasser>	Nah, fat chance, you are right, we are buying it below marked price and that can be more than 15% if the stocks went up
Sep 23 13:59:34 <fnasser>	But... maybe there is a bit of law specifically for that case
Sep 23 13:59:44 <fnasser>	To incentive investing or something
Sep 23 13:59:58 <Highlander>	I suspect the tax law works such that if they did it any other way, the company is on the hook for the difference .  THis way, it all on us
Sep 23 14:00:33 <fnasser>	Highlander, Anyway, bottom line is that it is still a savings account on steroids given the currently interest paied around, right?
Sep 23 14:01:12 <Highlander>	indeed. Its basically some free money
Sep 23 14:01:23 <fnasser>	Highlander, Got it!
Sep 23 14:01:26 <Highlander>	unles you are incredibly unlucky and the stock price drops by more than 15% before you can sell it :-)
Sep 23 14:01:35 <Highlander>	so there is still a TINY risk.
Sep 23 14:02:26 <Highlander>	if we had a black monday on exactly the wrong day.    I'd guess we'd have more pressing concerns if that happened tho :-) 
Sep 23 14:02:56 <fnasser>	Highlander, Rigt, I even think it happened when we had it a long time ago, but I just hung to my shares for a bit and they came back up.
Sep 23 14:02:59 <fnasser>	Highlander,   Thanks again Andrew! 
Sep 23 14:04:15 <Highlander>	np.  Glad to make stuff up anytime!
Sep 23 14:05:35 <fnasser>	:-)
Sep 23 14:10:17 <patrickm>	fnasser, Highlander: https://mojo.redhat.com/servlet/JiveServlet/previewBody/1091225-102-1-1838864/Canada%20ESPP.pdf
Sep 23 14:10:27 <patrickm>	[specific to Canada]
Sep 23 14:11:47 <fnasser>	patrickm, Thanks, will read that
Sep 23 14:12:18 <patrickm>	it answers some of the questions your were asking, not that Highlander's direction was incorrect
Sep 23 14:12:40 <patrickm>	rgb: what's the issue?  do you not have an existing Fidelity account?
Sep 23 14:13:47 <Highlander>	it doesnt address when they will take the amount., If they charge you tax on the full amount for 6 months of discount on one chqeue, that could really hurt that cheque a lot.  
Sep 23 14:15:22 <Highlander>	and they imply thats when you get charged.. we shall see.
Sep 23 14:15:43 <Highlander>	unless they issue you less shares to cover the tax due... which I suppose is possible since thats what they do with RSUs
Sep 23 14:16:36 <Highlander>	and that mechanism is already in place.. so thats probably what they'll do...  its the path of least work for them :-)
Sep 23 15:16:01 <rgb>	patrickm: do I have a fidelity account?
Sep 23 15:18:57 <patrickm>	rgb: yeah, do you have an existing account.  on monday, you'll just log in using the Ixxxxxxx userid / password combo and sign up there
Sep 23 15:19:25 <patrickm>	<rgb> sorry, under "outside US", "participant number"
Sep 23 15:25:34 <rgb>	patrickm: where do I find that number?
Sep 23 15:26:13 <rgb>	is it called something else?
Sep 23 15:27:02 <rgb>	related to dpsp?
Sep 23 15:27:13 <patrickm>	rgb: no, that's sunlife
Sep 23 15:27:48 <patrickm>	rgb: do you receive snail mail notifications from fidelity?   
Sep 23 15:28:04 <patrickm>	if so, it's on there as Participant Number
Sep 23 15:32:09 <rgb>	that doesn't ring a bell.  the only snail mail I receive is sunlife, for several different plans.
Sep 23 15:34:14 <rgb>	why would I have a fidelity number?
Sep 23 15:34:37 <fche>	you haven't received any stock-oriented benefits ever?
Sep 23 15:35:03 <rgb>	never.  it wasn't offered at hire.  I asked about it, but it wasn't available.
Sep 23 15:35:56 <fche>	ok ... I'm sure your manager etc. can tweak the right knobs to get things set up for you if you want to participate in the new program
Sep 23 15:36:15 <fche>	I don't recall whether we could sign up for the fidelity system on our own initiative and associate it with the RH company 
Sep 23 15:36:22 <stooke>	Ther's a line in the "Important ESPP Enrollment Information" email: "You will receive a separate enrollment communication from Fidelity on or about September 26th"
Sep 23 15:36:29 <fche>	at worst, ping the hr helpdesk?
Sep 23 15:37:06 <stooke>	So perhaps we get the number on Monday?
Sep 23 15:37:23 <fche>	could be!
Sep 23 15:37:24 <patrickm>	rgb: so the answer to the question is "i don't have an account"... both fche and stooke have provided good direction
Sep 23 15:41:58 <rgb>	ok, so I may see something monday.  I wish that were in the FAQs.

Sep 29 09:44:09 <green>	If it's done in bulk just before purchasing the stock, do we have the option to pull out if there's a huge negative swing in the exchange rate?

Oct 18 13:43:15 <stooke>	The Loblaws needs more Asian ingredients: fish sauce, wonton noodles and dumpling wrappers were missing.

Oct 25 14:09:03 <thauser>	dberry, you're looking for which patch?
Oct 25 14:09:23 <thauser>	dbhole, ^ 
Oct 25 14:09:29 <thauser>	dberry, misping sorry. 
Oct 25 14:09:48 <dbhole>	thauser: Well I installed 6.4.0 GA from the jar installer (I want to install bpms ultimately). I then tried to update to 11, which says minimum requirement is update 9, so trying to get 9 now
Oct 25 14:10:04 <thauser>	dbhole, alright, use this (thanks for using the installer woop)

Oct 25 14:10:25 <dbhole>	thauser: ah, nice.. thanks!
Oct 25 14:10:40 <thauser>	dbhole, easier than chasing a brew build down 
Oct 25 14:11:41 <dbhole>	thauser: agreed.. much faster now, thanks again
Oct 25 14:17:38 <dcheung>	thauser: does the bpms installer ship with eap?
Oct 25 14:17:47 <thauser>	dcheung, the bpms one does not, no
Oct 25 14:19:48 <dbhole>	thauser: Is there a way to download the latest update standalone without going through the patching process?
Oct 25 14:19:57 <thauser>	dbhole, absolutely: 
Oct 25 14:20:06 <thauser>	dbhole, http://download-node-02.eng.bos.redhat.com/released/JBEAP-6/6.4.11/jboss-eap-6.4.11-full-build.zip
Oct 25 14:20:39 <thauser>	dbhole, unzip that and you're good to go
Oct 25 14:21:21 <dbhole>	thauser: how come it is much smaller than the individual patches? Patch 9 for example is 607MB
Oct 25 14:22:05 <thauser>	dbhole, i'm actually not too familiar with the patching process. i always grab the latest full zip. 
Oct 25 14:22:33 <thauser>	dbhole, patch for .11 is small. .9 must contain something fundamentally different. 
Oct 25 14:24:30 <dbhole>	thauser: nice, that seems to have worked well, thanks
Oct 25 14:24:50 <thauser>	dbhole, 600 megs for a patch..i'm wondering if there's not some kind of error going on here
Oct 25 14:25:02 <thauser>	dbhole, that's only slightly smaller than the entire build maven repo $.$
Oct 25 14:25:29 <dbhole>	thauser: wonder if it contains maven artifacts too.. though it seems like too much for a patch
Oct 25 14:26:57 <mrobson>	just joined, but are you talking about EAP 6.4 CPs being really big?
Oct 25 14:27:34 <thauser>	mrobson, yes; update 9 is 600M, while update 11 is 88M; wondering about that
Oct 25 14:28:14 <mrobson>	thauser: the is a layering issue with the CPs in that each CP contains all the layers from the previous CP so they grow very quickly 
Oct 25 14:28:37 <mrobson>	thauser: CP9 is now a mandatory CP, you can;t apply CP10 or CP11 without CP 9, it was done to reset the size 
Oct 25 14:28:44 <thauser>	mrobson, i understand now
Oct 25 14:28:45 <mrobson>	thauser: this is fixed in EAP 7
Oct 25 14:29:00 <thauser>	mrobson, so for EAP 6.4.9, it contains all patches from 1 -> 8 as well. got it
Oct 25 14:29:25 <dbhole>	that explains the size.. glad to hear it is fixed in 7
Oct 25 14:29:41 <mrobson>	thauser: yep, but the size is an issue of the layering and that has been addressed 
Oct 25 14:30:00 <mrobson>	thauser: CP10 / 11 are small right now.. like CP1 / 2 but they will get big again :)
Oct 25 14:30:35 <thauser>	mrobson, thanks :D
Oct 25 14:30:39 <mrobson>	thauser: np
Oct 25 14:46:41 <dberry>	thauser, NP.  sorry, was OTP
Oct 25 14:57:11 <dcheung>	patrickm: do you have any pic of the totoro one?

Oct 31 11:04:18 <patrickm>	fnasser: just finishing off the last 1/4 round of PoilÃ¢ne... now the long wait until next Spring
Oct 31 11:08:15 <fche>	patrickm, why wait?
Oct 31 11:08:36 <fche>	btw, anyone here who went to FSOSS last week?  how did things go?
Oct 31 11:09:02 <fnasser>	patrickm, +1, or do they oly deliver in the Spring/Summer?
Oct 31 11:13:01 <yzhang>	fche, thing went pretty well
Oct 31 11:13:14 <ipun>	fche good turnout and some pretty good presentations overall
Oct 31 11:13:16 <yzhang>	notably all the speakers got cheeseboards
Oct 31 11:14:08 <fche>	("cheeseboard" -- my google is failing me -- surely they didn't get a berkeley pizza nor wood cutting boards!)
Oct 31 11:14:28 <fche>	thanks, sounds good though, looking forward to the videos
Oct 31 11:15:12 <yzhang>	"cheese cutting set" is probably how I should have phrased it
Oct 31 11:15:12 <ipun>	fche its like a charcuterie tool set, which was FSOSS branded
Oct 31 11:16:30 <fche>	aha.  interesting choice!
Oct 31 11:20:02 <patrickm>	fche: it's only special if you have it once a year... like Halloween
Oct 31 11:20:54 <patrickm>	fche: i agree with yzhang and ipun, FSOSS was good
Oct 31 11:22:14 <patrickm>	fche: the presentations from  ian/cody/josh/alex/jie/zack were well received 
Oct 31 11:23:30 <patrickm>	fnasser: if you're in to hard candy, my order from http://www.hammondscandies.com/ should be sitting on my desk
Oct 31 11:24:12 <patrickm>	fnasser: i did a trial order with some holiday candy to see how long it would take to get here
Oct 31 11:27:04 <fnasser>	patrickm, Candies have been removed from my diet by my personal dietitian :-(
Oct 31 11:27:46 <dcheung>	fnasser: when you're in the office she won't know

Oct 31 11:29:25 <fnasser>	true
Oct 31 11:29:43 <patrickm>	dcheung: you'll like next week's order -> http://ohdanishbakery.com/  [specifically the pumpkin caramel kringle]
Oct 31 11:30:29 <patrickm>	dcheung: one of our first interns was from the University of Wisconsin... and he arrived with one of these
Oct 31 11:30:46 <dcheung>	did he immediately get a full-time offer afterwards?
Oct 31 11:32:49 <patrickm>	dcheung: unfortunately, no...  i don't know where Faisal ended up... it's was long ago in a place far, far away [2323 Yonge Street]
Oct 31 11:33:07 <patrickm>	it*
Oct 31 11:33:55 <patrickm>	fnasser: my order for Murchies is coming up as well -> http://www.murchies.com/store/ , if your dietitian will allow tea ;)
Oct 31 11:35:36 <fnasser>	patrickm, Wow!  Now we can find everything on the Internet!
Oct 31 13:49:28 <mwringe>	there is a chocolate tart in the kitchen from my practising over the weekend, please help yourself. The crust is a bit cracked because the recipes instructions for time was not enough and I put it in the oven to cook some more, but after I had removed the tart ring

Nov 04 10:07:48 <patrickm>	mwringe: how much of a time commitment are these courses?  there are several interesting ones listed
Nov 04 10:08:11 *	patrickm is still on the fence for welding courses
Nov 04 10:09:06 <fche>	that's one of the few things /me misses about toronto - technicalish college courses
Nov 04 10:09:16 <fche>	er, and you all of course

Nov 04 10:10:44 <fche>	:)
Nov 04 10:29:45 <mwringe>	patrickm: I can't take that one since I wont have the prerequisite for it until part way through December. The courses are usually 1 day a week for 4 hours, over a 6 to 12 week period depending on the course.
Nov 04 10:30:27 <mwringe>	patrickm: but, I may be taking the short version of that course: https://coned.georgebrown.ca/courses-and-certificates/festive-sweets/
Nov 04 11:14:51 <fnasser>	mwringe, Angela said that the GBC hospitality courses are top-notch
Nov 04 11:15:28 <fnasser>	mwringe, A few of her colleagues from Nutrition and Food at Ryerson also took some courses there
Nov 04 11:17:38 <mwringe>	fnasser: their culinary program is great (I have taken something like 13 courses already and have my culinary arts certificate). I am just starting to their baking program, which is unfortunately (at least so far) not as good as their culinary ones, but it might just be because its their beginning course 
Nov 04 11:18:30 <patrickm>	mwringe: well, if you have to I won't stop you ;)

Nov 07 11:22:01 <mwringe>	patrickm: awesome
Nov 07 11:23:27 <mwringe>	patrickm: I am finding the culinary side to be a lot better than the baking side, 9088 is fairly basic to get everyone started and the better courses are the ones you can take after that one

Nov 07 13:18:55 <mwringe>	there is a white chocolate raspberry cake in the kitchen, please help yourself. Its from my weekend practising, hopefully its good
Nov 07 13:19:13 <dcheung>	mwringe++ it looks amazing
Nov 07 13:29:59 <rgrunber>	mwringe: it's good.
Nov 07 13:30:56 <mwringe>	its not bad, there is a bunch of things I would probably do differently if I were to make it again
Nov 07 13:31:30 <dcheung>	to do differently: make 2 cakes instead of 1
Nov 08 11:49:33 <patrickm>	received an order this morning from Murchies in BC... half of a delicious Christmas cake is in the kitchen

Nov 08 11:50:00 *	patrickm is a nice guy... but not a "whole cake" nice guy 
Nov 08 12:04:19 <rgb>	oh lovely.  this was just announced today:  http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Rs-500-and-Rs-1000-notes-pulled-out-of-circulation-immediately-PM-Narendra-Modi/articleshow/55315473.cms
Nov 08 12:05:16 *	rgb is holding Rs16,000 in 1000 and 500 notes.  (50:1 Rs:$CDN)
Nov 08 12:05:46 <rgb>	so in 1.5h this wad is worth nothing.
Nov 08 12:07:06 <yzhang>	still tradable until end of december
Nov 08 12:07:28 <yzhang>	it seems
Nov 08 12:07:38 <rgrunber>	yeah.. just need to find a bank that takes them..
Nov 08 12:08:11 <rgrunber>	also is the article translated beacause there are quite a few typos.
Nov 08 12:26:10 <rgb>	and can only exchange Rs4000 per day...
Nov 08 12:26:19 <rgb>	http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/heres-what-you-can-do-with-rs500-and-rs100-notes/listshow/55316702.cms
Nov 08 12:26:29 <rgb>	since I don't have a local bank account
Nov 08 12:28:10 <rgb>	sorry, it just says up to Rs4000, so maybe that is per transaction...  doesn't have a time window specified.
Nov 08 12:29:20 <rgb>	yzhang: yeah, I was being dramatic...  I took out enough today to pay Rs12,000 for furniture today that turned out not to be ready yet, so I'm still holding that cash.
Nov 08 12:29:51 <yzhang>	That article does make it sound very sudden though
Nov 08 12:30:05 <yzhang>	I'm sure there are people who are receiving it very negatively
Nov 08 12:32:25 <rgb>	yes, undoubtedly, but so far, none of that negativity has appeared in the media...
Nov 08 12:33:14 <rgb>	Rs1000 is the largest note now.  middle class seems to deal mostly in Rs100 notes.

Nov 29 13:15:01 <stooke>	In Japan, staff that go on vacation were thought to be "letting down the team".  While that view is changing, the custom of "omiyage" (something brought back from the travels) remains.
Nov 29 13:15:49 <stooke>	In that spirit, I am about to put a box of small mochi (rice flour balls, usually with red bean paste inside) in the kitchen.
Nov 29 13:16:31 <rgrunber>	let the custom of free food in the kitchen continue for years to come.
Nov 29 13:21:47 <stooke>	It'll probably go rock hard by the end of the day, so please eat up!
Nov 29 13:29:42 <dcheung>	stooke++
Nov 29 13:54:38 <fche>	stooke, 10 seconds microwave oomph restores dry mochi to yumminess
Nov 29 13:54:54 <fche>	40 seconds turns it into mush

Dec 14 13:56:35 <mwringe>	lisac: yeah, sort of, it was a bit strange and we just really assembled them. I don't know why a baking a class would ever use pre-made tart shells
Dec 14 14:02:51 <lisac>	mwringe, taste just fine:-)
Dec 14 14:05:14 <mwringe>	lisac: yeah, they taste good. I just think it was weird to use premade shells. But maybe it was to save time. We did the mincemeat tarts, shortbread cookies, biscotti cookies and christmas cake all last night
Dec 14 14:07:56 <mwringe>	and tonight we finish the cookies and make panettone. I think tonight should be a shorter class
Dec 14 14:09:04 <lisac>	mwringe, christmas cake..soaked in rum?
Dec 14 14:10:02 <mwringe>	lisac: yes, with the fruits being soaked for the last couple of weeks.
Dec 14 14:11:19 <lisac>	mwringe,* i should be on pto during december when mwringe is at cooking school
Dec 14 14:14:04 <mwringe>	lisac: it smells and looks really good. I shared the tarts, I don't know if I will share the better stuff with the office :)

Dec 19 15:18:34 <LG>	i go by Rio time... ;-)
Dec 19 15:23:21 <steveg>	anyway, i dont mind, the earlier the better
Dec 19 15:26:13 <LG>	ok then...
Dec 19 15:35:03 <dcheung>	I thought that was 7 PM ET?
Dec 19 15:35:34 <dcheung>	oh yeah it's AM
Dec 19 15:37:53 <steveg>	dcheung, i dont think LG wants me tinkering with his VMs at 7 PM on a Friday, the results would be interesting tho
Dec 19 15:38:09 <steveg>	>:D
Dec 19 15:39:56 <dcheung>	I genuinely thought it would be better in PM. but oh well.
Dec 19 15:40:28 <steveg>	dcheung, i assume you mean from a nobody using them perspective?
Dec 19 15:41:38 <dcheung>	steveg: yeah. 7AM eastern time: the Brno guys might be using the mead-scheduler cause it's around 1pm in Brno
Dec 19 15:42:55 <steveg>	dcheung, well, from my POV i didn't get to set the time - im just going off what LG sent out
Dec 19 15:43:08 <steveg>	dcheung, that said i cant do that evening anyway, i could do it on thursday evening potentially
Dec 19 15:43:28 <dcheung>	steveg: nah it's fine. Friday morning 7AM EST. the notice is already sent anyways
Dec 19 15:44:20 <steveg>	dcheung, the other reason i am always hesitant to schedule these things at night is if something does go wrong i dont have as many of the virt support staff to lean on
Dec 19 15:44:34 <dcheung>	yeah makes sense!
Dec 19 15:44:53 <steveg>	(which has happened before, i had issues with the 2.3->3.0 upgrade where i had to get GSS help to rescue some images)
Dec 19 15:46:26 <LG>	steveg, dcheung wasn't thinking right.. i was aiming for 9 am TO time..  ...  
Dec 19 15:46:47 <steveg>	such is life
Dec 19 15:46:59 <LG>	tell me about it!
Dec 19 15:47:02 <steveg>	like dcheung said it is probably better to just stick to it now it is sent
Dec 19 15:47:10 <steveg>	ideally i am not going to need to full time allocated anyway
Dec 19 15:47:28 <LG>	well it not like its engraved in stone...
Dec 19 15:47:34 <LG>	but still i don't mind

Dec 22 12:32:05 <rgrunber>	it's quite the consistent typo.. every date field has it.
Dec 22 12:32:39 <rgrunber>	must have been a really good burger..
Dec 22 12:32:40 <sergiodj>	that was a very good burger
Dec 22 12:36:04 <rgrunber>	at this point i'm ready to flip a coin
Dec 22 12:36:57 <rgrunber>	ok so https://datatables.net/plug-ins/sorting/date-dd-MMM-yyyy is actually a thing.. therefore seems reasonable.
Dec 22 12:47:53 <alanm>	heh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country  "All three main types are used in Canada â€“ in French and in English"

Dec 23 07:08:31 <steveg>	that's going to take a while so i am going to grab a coffee
Dec 23 07:08:44 <LG>	great idea!  me too
Dec 23 07:58:36 <steveg>	LG, toothless is back up, please verify that it is functioning as you expect
Dec 23 07:58:52 <steveg>	LG, assuming yes - that concludes the outage and you can send a response to your outage announcement confirming that
Dec 23 08:06:07 <LG>	so far, seems ok..  still checking
Dec 23 08:08:44 <LG>	steveg, yep.. all is good... :-)  Thanks Steve!!!

Jan 03 10:37:44 <patrickm>	someone dropped a BULA toque in front of my cave... i've crushed it in the hall closest door handle
Jan 03 10:40:15 <rgrunber>	scared me for a sec.. i have such a toque.. but mine is still in my bag
Jan 03 12:43:31 <LG>	steveg, is to-virt1 under your umbrella? 
Jan 03 12:48:37 <steveg>	LG, not really no - fche and deepak
Jan 03 12:48:40 <steveg>	LG, why?
Jan 03 12:49:19 <LG>	steveg, thanks!  have a VM on it (tooth) which i rebooted about an hour ago and it still hasn't come back
Jan 03 12:49:43 <steveg>	LG, VM is up 
Jan 03 12:50:01 <steveg>	LG, boot failed because it was unable to mount NFS filesystem /mnt/curly
Jan 03 12:50:07 <steveg>	LG, whatever that is when it's at home
Jan 03 12:50:26 <steveg>	actually more accurately it looks like the shutdown got stuck on this step
Jan 03 12:50:26 <LG>	oh
Jan 03 12:50:36 <steveg>	"device is busy"
Jan 03 12:50:53 <LG>	steveg, hehe..  could you take a shotgun to it?  
Jan 03 12:51:17 <steveg>	LG, sure - obviously whatever is writing to the device will not be happy - you can keep the pieces!
Jan 03 12:51:25 <LG>	:-)
Jan 03 12:51:47 <steveg>	it is booting now
Jan 03 12:51:50 <steveg>	also eww el5

Jan 03 12:52:17 <LG>	yeah...  i've been trying to get rid of this guy for the last 4 yrs!
Jan 03 12:52:49 <LG>	i even have a "replacement" on torricelli for it...  called testnewett  
Jan 03 12:56:04 <fche>	is there anything you'd like me to do with the tooth vm or to-virt1 host?
Jan 03 12:56:06 <fche>	just checking

Jan 03 13:04:47 <LG>	steveg, thanks!
Jan 03 13:32:41 <steveg>	fche, sorry was AFK - just confirming i rebooted the guest for LG and looks ok now
Jan 03 13:32:47 <fche>	righto
Jan 03 13:33:34 <steveg>	LG_lunch, im assuming that the inability to unmount the NFS share was because something in your guest was still using it and wouldn't let go - i think you would have to address that inside the guest

Jan 17 13:09:43 <rgrunber>	steveg: for Cygnus.. hmm i would guess ~30ish.
Jan 17 13:10:02 <rgrunber>	i think it could hold more but requires packing up the tables.. which has become more complicated now..
Jan 17 13:10:05 <steveg>	rgrunber, thanks yeah that is my usual guess just trying to validate im not completely off base
Jan 17 13:15:00 <rgrunber>	steveg: https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-990736 lists the capacity at 16, but i assume that's with the table as is and no stackable chairs (there's 24 of them) at the far back.

Jan 18 10:55:20 <chrisphi_>	When you are at F-Blondeel, try their hot chocolate drink (Mayan?)! I like sitting in their cafe watching the PM Brussels shuffle into the subway (or is it ) in the square  ;-) Have fun, don't drink any bad beer.

Jan 25 15:26:50 <lisac>	actuallly a few days after...as told in the presentation last week
Jan 25 15:27:26 <fche>	oh well, hoped to set it up before traveling
Jan 25 15:27:46 <lisac>	bring the zurich insurance information with you as well
Jan 25 15:28:20 <lisac>	Overall plan: https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-998657
Jan 25 15:28:20 <lisac>	Zurich Travel Assistance Info: http://www.zurich.co.uk/en/business/services/travel-assistance.   
Jan 25 15:28:54 <fche>	hm after what I read on thread, I may be better off getting something personal
Jan 25 15:29:10 <lisac>	you are covered....no need 
Jan 25 15:38:44 <mwringe>	lisac: I thought from the thread we were not adequately covered for even something relatively minor. But I wasn't paying too much attention to it. How much coverage do we have on this travel insurance?
Jan 25 15:40:48 <lisac>	mwringe, i have not read the full document however between Zurich and GWL/Manulife we have coverage for travel
Jan 25 15:41:09 *	fche doesn't think it's a simple yes/no question really
Jan 25 15:41:22 <steveg>	it's not
Jan 25 15:42:33 <steveg>	the response i eventually got from our "Treasury Risk Manager" when pressing regarding the zurich policy and pre-existing conditions involved the word "should"
Jan 25 15:42:55 <steveg>	not really that satisfactory having been left out in the cold by such a policy in a previous life
Jan 25 16:39:45 <steveg>	lisac, i posed the question on the mojo page for the zurich stuff
Jan 25 16:40:01 <steveg>	lisac, i think there is still an open question there as to which takes precedence for *business* travel
Jan 25 16:40:21 <lisac>	steveg; i know it is being worked on, such as providing a north american number in case of emergency
Jan 25 16:40:24 <steveg>	(notwithstanding the many other issues with the lack of detail on the actual zurich policy)
Jan 25 16:40:39 <steveg>	lisac, yes
Jan 25 16:40:45 <lisac>	Zurich takes precedence
Jan 25 16:40:52 <steveg>	lisac, i would think for business travel the zurich policy...yeah that
Jan 25 16:41:06 <steveg>	but as usual it would be good to have it written down rather than having folks to guess
Jan 25 16:41:22 <lisac>	they are working on a mojo page
Jan 25 16:41:23 <steveg>	the problem is im nosy so im going to ask now, but some poor sod is going to have to find all this out in an actual emergency
Jan 25 16:41:29 <steveg>	because we didnt write it down
Jan 25 16:42:16 <lisac>	I believe there is a card to print off within the given site ...is there not?
Jan 25 16:42:18 <steveg>	my other open is still about pre-existing conditions, the only answer i got was that they "should" be covered without any detail as to what that actually means
Jan 25 16:42:31 <steveg>	that is just a card with phone # / policy info
Jan 25 16:42:38 <steveg>	it doesnt help you establish what you are covered for
Jan 25 16:42:46 <lisac>	not many policies cover pre existing...even ones you buy privately
Jan 25 16:42:52 <steveg>	right
Jan 25 16:42:55 <steveg>	exactly my point
Jan 25 16:43:02 <steveg>	yet our folks tell us we are covered
Jan 25 16:43:13 <steveg>	without giving a definition for what zurich consider pre-existing
Jan 25 16:43:25 <lisac>	Manulife stated that there had to be no changes within 90 days
Jan 25 16:43:26 <steveg>	the 90 day thing mentioned by manulife is actually pretty generous
Jan 25 16:43:43 <steveg>	i have seen other policies say as much as any hospitalization/doctor/etc in 2 years
Jan 25 16:43:45 <steveg>	voids the coverage
Jan 25 16:44:39 <steveg>	lisac, anyway i know you are just the messenger :)

Jan 27 16:49:11 <patrickm>	mwringe: there was some gum stuck on my boot so i used kofola to burn it off
Jan 27 16:49:19 <mwringe>	:)
Jan 27 16:49:48 <patrickm>	mwringe: you have to admit, that stuff is at best an acquired taste
Jan 27 16:52:04 <mwringe>	patrickm: I didn't think it was that bad, there were people on my team who though it was amazing.

Jan 30 17:43:03 <patrickm>	xfnasser: i'll be back in the office thursday next week after FOSDEM
Jan 31 10:42:22 <rattapat>	guys, does anyone have access to the lab in toronto?
Jan 31 10:43:15 <steveg>	i do but im not in today
Jan 31 10:43:18 <rgrunber>	physical, yes.. myself and dcheung .. lberk too i would think.
Jan 31 10:43:22 <steveg>	lberk, and dbhole|brno are other candidates
Jan 31 10:43:30 <dcheung>	I'm not in today
Jan 31 10:43:43 <rgrunber>	i am.. if you need meet me by the lab :P
Jan 31 10:45:31 <rgrunber>	.. unless you need me to reboot/do something..
Jan 31 10:45:35 <rattapat>	rgrunber: haha .. I'm at a customer, but I have a machine that needs to be plugged in. I believe a sticker with my name "rajith" is on the box
Jan 31 10:45:57 <rattapat>	rgrunber: are you able to help out?
Jan 31 10:46:19 <rgrunber>	sure.. i'll give it a shot..
Jan 31 10:47:07 <rattapat>	rgrunber: thank you kind sir! much appreciated
Jan 31 10:47:08 <rgrunber>	is it already configured to take a static ip ?..
Jan 31 10:47:44 <rattapat>	rgrunber: I remember requesting one .. this has been out of commission for over 2 years. So can't recall
Jan 31 10:48:03 <rattapat>	rgrunber: there's a good chance it does have a static ip
Jan 31 10:55:28 <rgrunber>	rattapat: most of the machines have to- stickers.. i couldn't find any with your name. there is one that's silver iirc and about the size of a small box and couldn't find any markings on it.
Jan 31 10:56:12 <rattapat>	rgrunber: hmm... let me try to find that name ...sorry for wasting your time
Jan 31 10:56:35 <rgrunber>	np.. physical activity :P 
Jan 31 10:57:40 <rattapat>	rgrunber: iirc there was some sort of webpage that lists the toronto inventory .. do you know the link?
Jan 31 10:57:59 <dbhole|brno>	https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-983905
Jan 31 11:00:05 <rattapat>	rgrunber: to-Muditha  ... thanks Dpak!
Jan 31 11:00:32 <rgrunber>	hah.. i was just gonna say tooma2x, topke, beagle2, jck and muditha appeared to be not up.. yay muditha it is
Jan 31 11:00:58 <patrickm>	rattapat: is muditha your daughter
Jan 31 11:01:14 <rattapat>	patrickm: no my middle name :)
Jan 31 11:01:20 <patrickm>	rattapat: ok then
Jan 31 11:01:34 <rattapat>	patrickm: hahaha
Jan 31 11:02:54 <rattapat>	rgrunber: thanks again!
Jan 31 11:13:27 <rgrunber>	rattapat: tried starting it (was plugged in) but didn't start. the green light at the back on the power supply wasn't on. tried a different power cord and same thing :\
Jan 31 11:13:56 <rgrunber>	and didn't see one of those on/off switches for it so i assume it should be on the moment it's plugged in.
Jan 31 11:18:27 <rattapat>	rgrunber: ah I see

Feb 01 09:53:10 <jkang>	hi! a number of machines in the server room are inaccessible. I've checked them out and it seems the switch or router that assigns them ip addresses isn't doing so. One of the consoles on the rack shows something along the lines of 'ipv4 address acquiring dhcp'. Does anyone know what steps should be taken to resolve this?
Feb 01 09:53:52 <lisac>	all the printers were down as well..i just rebooted them
Feb 01 09:56:37 <steveg>	jkang, so it actually is handing out addresses
Feb 01 09:56:57 <steveg>	jkang, but a number of machines gave up asking so you have to ifdown / ifup the interfaces
Feb 01 09:57:00 <steveg>	jkang, or reboot
Feb 01 09:57:26 <steveg>	jkang, the rhev environment is up and between dcheung and i we should have got those VMs connecting again
Feb 01 09:57:38 <steveg>	jkang, and i can reboot any VMs on to-virt1 if required
Feb 01 09:57:44 <jkang>	steveg, okay; I'll try that out now then, thanks!
Feb 01 10:05:19 <dcheung>	jkang: yeah if you need any help let us know
Feb 01 10:09:21 <jkang>	restarting the interfaces worked out
Feb 01 10:09:33 <rgrunber>	jkang: yeah same ^
Feb 01 10:42:20 <law>	dcheung: any chance someone could look at tor & torsion?   I don't see any signs that they've come back up yet
Feb 01 10:44:26 <dcheung>	law: are they vms or physical machines?
Feb 01 10:46:26 <law>	they're physical machines
Feb 01 10:46:54 <dcheung>	jkang: could you go reboot them? I'm not in the office :(
Feb 01 10:47:23 <dcheung>	or restart their network
Feb 01 10:47:33 <jkang>	dcheung, do you know where they are? rgrunber was having trouble finding them
Feb 01 10:48:04 <dcheung>	:[ I don't know
Feb 01 10:48:22 <law>	let me see if I can find vlad on irc, he ought to know where they are
Feb 01 10:49:30 <vmakarov>	what is up
Feb 01 10:50:00 <law>	Vlad, can you tell jkang where tor/torsion are physically located?  they're looking to reboot them to get their networks running again
Feb 01 10:50:33 <vmakarov>	it is the most left cabinet (near the wall)
Feb 01 10:50:59 <vmakarov>	the both servers are dell R730
Feb 01 10:52:16 <vmakarov>	my suspicion is a router.  all my desktop computers are available.  but all my server machines are not available.
Feb 01 10:56:07 <vmakarov>	so it would be reasonable to try to reboot the servers and after that a router to which they are connected (if it is available because it might be in a cage which are not available for us).
Feb 01 10:59:58 <jkang>	the two dell r730s have been rebooted; hopefully it works out
Feb 01 11:01:19 <dcheung>	maybe we should put labels on them for the next time(tm)
Feb 01 11:03:57 <jkang>	where do the labels come from? there's another machine in there I want to label as well hahah..
Feb 01 11:04:24 <dcheung>	jkang: shout lisaccccccccccc!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Feb 01 11:05:14 <vmakarov>	jkang, dcheung: thank you.  putting labels has sense.  I'll put them my next visit to the office.
Feb 01 11:06:58 <law>	torsion seems to be up, but still doesn't have a DNS record and hasn't mounted /home...
Feb 01 11:09:10 <vmakarov>	law: /home on torsion is mounted.
Feb 01 11:09:41 <law>	and is has a DNS record now...  good :-)
Feb 01 11:10:02 <law>	I'll never remember 10.15.24.128 ;-)
Feb 01 11:12:12 <rgrunber>	jkang: if you can label toatom or whichever that was as well :P.. hard to expose the label on top..
Feb 01 11:12:37 <law>	jkang: tyvm...   
Feb 01 11:13:02 <rgrunber>	law: vmakarov also one of those machines had a PSU error.. 
Feb 01 11:13:45 <rgrunber>	flashed on scrolling display..
Feb 01 11:14:39 <vmakarov>	rgrunber: do you mean a Dell R730 server?
Feb 01 11:14:49 <rgrunber>	vmakarov: yes
Feb 01 11:15:43 <vmakarov>	rgrunber: is it a server with filled 6 disk bays?
Feb 01 11:15:55 <jkang>	vmakarov, rgrunber er; one of the cables was unplugged. I took the initiative and plugged it back in. The PSU warning disappeared... was that okay?
Feb 01 11:16:14 <jkang>	or was it unplugged on purpose..
Feb 01 11:16:27 <dcheung>	jkang: you just broke the matrix
Feb 01 11:18:38 <vmakarov>	jkang: i don't think it was unplugged on purpose.  the servers have 2 PSU.  the both PSU should be plugged.
Feb 01 11:20:28 <jkang>	vmakarov, I'm going to make a bulk request for stickers; I've added tor and torsion to the list. If you tell me which one is which I can label them for you; otherwise I'll leave the stickers with lisa and you can ask her next time you come into the office;
Feb 01 11:21:53 <vmakarov>	jkang: thanks.  I'll put the labels by myself my next office visit.
Feb 01 11:22:37 <jkang>	okay, sounds good!
Feb 01 11:24:36 <rgrunber>	vmakarov: ah ok I was there with jkang so if that fixed it, great. iirc it was for psu2..
Feb 01 11:25:13 <vmakarov>	unfortunately tor is still not responsive.  it is a server with 6 populated and 2 empty disk bays.
Feb 01 11:25:18 <rgrunber>	vmakarov: just came back though and saw : 'MEM0702 Correctable memory error rate exceeded for DIMM_A7. Reseat memory'
Feb 01 11:27:52 <vmakarov>	jkang: i think it is tor then because it is not reachable.  ok, i'll look at tor tomorrow.
Feb 01 11:29:22 <law>	vmakarov: sounds reasonable...  
Feb 01 11:37:16 <vmakarov>	law: tomorrow could be a good time to upgrade tor to FC25.  what is your opinion about that?
Feb 01 11:44:03 <law>	sure...  works for me...
Feb 01 11:44:51 <vmakarov>	law: ok. thanks.
Feb 01 12:40:23 <fnasser>	Has anyone received the promised e-mail with the "activation code" from Manulife?
Feb 01 12:40:56 <fnasser>	"Activation key" actually
Feb 01 12:42:41 <rgrunber>	fnasser: yes, it should have been in a second email. they came back to back for me.
Feb 01 12:43:05 <omajid_wfh>	fnasser: i got a mail with subject "Activate your access to the Manulife Plan Member Secure Site." that includes "Enter your personal site activation key - " followed by a bunch of letter and numbers
Feb 01 12:51:32 <lisac>	fnasser: I got mine shortly after registering as well however the code was not in their system when i went to enter it so I had to call in...they sent me a new code and all done...
Feb 01 12:53:11 <fnasser>	lisac I did not get any e-mail back yet, so I am keeping the page where it asks for the Activiation key up
Feb 01 12:53:35 <fnasser>	Maybe it will be there when I get back from lunch.  If not I will call them
Feb 01 12:54:20 <fnasser>	omajid_wfh, it seems that for me it would be more like rgrunber described.  Let me try and look again for it
Feb 01 12:54:57 <fnasser>	"An e-mail will be immediately sent to you containing your "Activation Key". Please follow the instructions contained in that e-mail."
Feb 01 12:55:26 <fnasser>	AHH!!!!  Red Hat filter considered it Junk!!!!
Feb 01 12:57:45 <fnasser>	I am in!
Feb 01 12:57:50 <fnasser>	Thanks everyone
Feb 01 15:15:39 <steveg>	rattapat, i forgot to ping you earlier - not sure if you noticed we had some residual networking issues overnight
Feb 01 15:16:00 <steveg>	rattapat, your VM is up in RHEV but you may need to log in to the portal and open a console to reset its networking if it has lost its IP
Feb 01 15:16:23 <steveg>	rattapat, the alternative hit it with a hammer approach is just to reboot it
Feb 01 15:43:31 <rattapat>	steveg: hey thanks... for some reason I was just able just ssh into it.
Feb 01 15:43:46 <rattapat>	steveg: I was never able to log into the console ...
Feb 01 15:44:03 <rattapat>	steveg: for some unfortunate reason it never recognized my credentials
Feb 01 15:46:00 <rattapat>	steveg: but at some point I want to sort that out so deepak doesn't have to keep creating vms for me :)
Feb 01 15:49:22 <steveg>	i dunno there's a lot to be said for annoying deepak
Feb 01 15:56:18 <rattapat>	steveg: hahah 
Feb 02 14:10:28 <rattapat>	rgrunber: steveg will one of you guys be around tomorrow at the office? I need access to the lab to get my machine going
Feb 02 14:15:17 <lisac>	rattapat, I can give you access if they are not here
Feb 02 14:15:36 <rattapat>	lisac thanks Lisa!
Feb 02 14:59:34 <rgrunber>	steveg: you're going to be in tomorrow ?
Feb 02 14:59:43 <rgrunber>	oh... nvm
Feb 02 14:59:44 <rgrunber>	misread that.
Feb 03 09:14:00 <patrickm>	fche: smooth travels back?
Feb 03 09:14:24 <fche>	yeah, just long long ... and the stopover at Boston Logan was as unpleasant as you hinted
Feb 03 09:14:35 <fche>	place = plague :)
Feb 03 09:15:16 <patrickm>	fche: there's only so many dunkin donuts you can consume
Feb 03 09:15:42 <fche>	or one too many sweaty-back patdowns after that 2km walk from one terminal to the other
Feb 03 10:13:17 <dcheung>	steveg: do you know if anyone in the RHEV team is working on a jenkins plugin for RHEV?
Feb 03 10:13:52 <steveg>	dcheung, honestly not sure - i would ask in #rhev-dev or on rhev-tech@redhat.com
Feb 03 10:14:08 <steveg>	dcheung, i know they have build new ansible modules but i have to  complete the move to RHV 4.0 for that
Feb 03 10:14:21 <steveg>	(which means we have to install rhel 7 on torrecelli at some point)
Feb 03 10:14:40 <dcheung>	steveg: if not, maybe I'll bug them to make the one I have become 'supported' by them
Feb 03 10:15:08 <dcheung>	I got it to connect to toner, grab the IP of the VM and then ssh to it
Feb 03 10:28:24 <steveg>	dcheung, connect via the api i assume?
Feb 03 10:30:21 <dcheung>	steveg: yeah connect to toner via the ovirt api
Feb 03 10:30:28 <dcheung>	to bring up/down the vm
Feb 03 10:30:31 <steveg>	dcheung, ok
Feb 03 10:30:43 <steveg>	dcheung, fyi i think in 4 they change the api but i think there is backwards compat until 4.1
Feb 03 10:32:38 <dcheung>	steveg: ohh thanks for the warning! I'm using an old client from 2014 I think
Feb 03 10:32:45 <dcheung>	will bump the version
Feb 03 10:32:52 <steveg>	dcheung, dont worry about it for now
Feb 03 10:32:57 <steveg>	dcheung, we wont be on 4 for a while :)
Feb 03 10:33:18 <steveg>	dcheung, to do the torrecelli upgrade i will need to move another host in that cluster to put the VMs on temporarily
Feb 03 10:33:54 <dcheung>	steveg: can you just bring them offline, backup, then do the upgrade?
Feb 03 10:36:25 <steveg>	dcheung, technically yes (the storage is already external) but it's safer/easier to do it with a  spare host
Feb 03 10:36:42 <steveg>	dcheung, just because if anything goes wrong and it takes longer than expected the workloads stay up
Feb 03 10:37:08 <steveg>	dcheung, do you folks have anything running directly on torricelli itself that i need to worry about?
Feb 03 10:37:15 <steveg>	(read: not in VMs)
Feb 03 10:39:25 <dcheung>	steveg: to my knowledge, no. LG: ^^ ?
Feb 03 10:40:47 <LG>	steveg, No
Feb 03 10:40:57 <LG>	steveg, what are you planning?
Feb 03 10:41:06 <steveg>	LG, basically:
Feb 03 10:41:22 <steveg>	1) move all VMs off one of to-virt3 or 4 (i have enough capacity free to do this)
Feb 03 10:41:30 <steveg>	2) move the now empty host to the EAP cluster
Feb 03 10:41:47 <steveg>	3) move VMs from torrecelli to new host in EAP cluster
Feb 03 10:41:55 <steveg>	4) reinstall torrecelli with RHEL 7
Feb 03 10:42:04 <steveg>	5) add torrecelli to RHEV again
Feb 03 10:42:11 <steveg>	6) move VMs back to torrecelli
Feb 03 10:42:18 <steveg>	7) move borrowed host back to default cluster
Feb 03 10:42:30 <steveg>	8) do the manager upgrade to RHV 4
Feb 03 10:42:33 <LG>	hum..
Feb 03 10:42:35 <steveg>	EOM
Feb 03 10:42:42 <LG>	when?
Feb 03 10:42:54 <steveg>	whenever really
Feb 03 10:42:59 <steveg>	the whole idea is there is no VM outage
Feb 03 10:44:07 <LG>	am waiting on fnasser to tell me when I can deactivate tomentum, so i can upgrade it to rhel 7 and add it to RHEV
Feb 03 10:44:42 <LG>	so, hopefully do it all in one haul ? ;-)
Feb 03 10:45:50 <fnasser>	LG steveg We need tomentum for a little more.  EAP 7.1 was delayed so we are still going on with 6.4.x.  Will look into using tonga though
Feb 03 10:46:14 <steveg>	fnasser, not sure that directly impacts what im talking about here
Feb 03 10:46:35 <steveg>	read: i do not need tomentum to complete any of the above
Feb 03 10:46:43 <LG>	steveg, fnasser yeah... i'll hold off tomentum and we can go for what needs be done with torricelli then
Feb 03 10:47:20 <steveg>	also a Q that came up after the other day's shenanigans
Feb 03 10:47:29 <steveg>	do those machines have the remote management interface configured?
Feb 03 10:47:42 <steveg>	if not i will set that up as well
Feb 03 10:47:54 <steveg>	it's v. handy if you need to reboot or get a console remotely
Feb 03 10:48:19 <LG>	hum...  i can't remember..  some things are still fuzzy... am guessing no
Feb 03 10:49:55 <LG>	I agree
Feb 03 10:50:58 <dcheung>	steveg: by that do you mean: the guest rhev agent rpm + service you install in the vms?
Feb 03 10:51:08 <steveg>	dcheung, nah im talking about the physical boxes
Feb 03 10:51:16 <dcheung>	ah!
Feb 03 10:51:44 <steveg>	dcheung, they have a management module that if it's wired up to ethernet and configured you can use to perform some management/maintenance tasks even if the box itself is stuck for some reason
Feb 03 10:51:58 <dcheung>	fancy!

Feb 03 13:23:00 <rgrunber>	damn that hurts the ears!
Feb 03 14:35:57 <dcheung>	steveg: what do I need to do to make some of the RHEV templates available in the EAP_Productization cluster?
Feb 03 14:52:33 <steveg>	dcheung, existing ones?
Feb 03 14:53:31 <steveg>	dcheung, it's a bit clunky but basically you want to attach the ExportNew domain to the Default cluster, export the templates to it
Feb 03 14:53:49 <steveg>	dcheung, then detach the ExportNew domain and attach it to EAP_Productization and import them there
Feb 03 14:54:11 <dcheung>	steveg: ok, will try!
Feb 03 14:54:38 <steveg>	dcheung, if you have any issues let me know, it does take a while as it is actually making complete copies of the templates
Feb 03 14:55:07 <steveg>	dcheung, so at the end of the process there will be a version of the template on both the NFS that backs the Default cluster and the SAN that backs the EAP cluster
Feb 03 14:55:45 <steveg>	i need to script the template creation so it does both at the same for when we get a new RHEL release but it's not something i've gotten around to
Feb 03 14:57:44 <dcheung>	gotcha
Feb 03 15:31:41 <rgrunber>	does anyone know offhand why /vol/engarchive2 won't mount.. on vtap-eng01.storage.rdu2.redhat.com ?
Feb 03 15:34:24 <rgrunber>	phew.. so it's not just me..
Feb 03 15:35:47 <dcheung>	rgrunber: they changed the NFS drive
Feb 03 15:35:49 <dcheung>	one momento

Feb 08 13:59:26 <dcheung>	steveg: weird question: what permissions does the eapbatch user need to have to talk to toner via its API?
Feb 08 13:59:41 <dcheung>	does it actually require superuser permissions?
Feb 08 14:23:15 <steveg>	dcheung, it actually depends what functions it wants to execute
Feb 08 14:23:26 <steveg>	dcheung, that is, going through the api it has the same permissions it has via the UI
Feb 08 14:23:32 <dcheung>	steveg: just listing vms
Feb 08 14:23:34 <dcheung>	hmmmm
Feb 08 14:23:46 <steveg>	dcheung, should be able to do that with just the user level perms
Feb 08 14:23:56 <steveg>	dcheung, but perhaps you are listing VMs it doesnt have perms on?
Feb 08 14:24:26 <steveg>	dcheung, say i log in on my normal user account, i can list VMs, but i cant list *your* VMs unless you explicitly added me in the permissions?
Feb 08 14:25:42 <dcheung>	I'm just doing api.getVMs().list()
Feb 08 14:26:09 <dcheung>	so I don't know, maybe the 'getVMs()' call does list vms I don't have permissions
Feb 08 14:29:08 <dcheung>	I think I removed some scary permissions on eapbatch and that's why this is now failing. will investigate more
Feb 08 14:29:12 <steveg>	mmm it should be smart enough to just not show them
Feb 08 14:45:33 <dcheung>	oh it's failing at 'GET /api' with basic auth
Feb 08 14:45:51 <dcheung>	code  : 400
Feb 08 14:45:51 <dcheung>	reason: Bad Request
Feb 08 14:45:52 <dcheung>	detail: query execution failed due to insufficient permissions.
Feb 08 14:49:20 <steveg>	dcheung, can you auth using its creds at https://toner.yyz.redhat.com/ovirt-engine/api
Feb 08 14:49:21 <steveg>	?
Feb 08 14:49:46 <steveg>	dcheung, guess not, i cant with my regular user account either
Feb 08 14:50:36 <dcheung>	steveg: url I'm hitting is: https://toner.yyz.redhat.com:443/api
Feb 08 14:53:27 <steveg>	ends up in the same place ;)
Feb 08 14:55:57 <steveg>	let me ask in sbr-virt
Feb 08 15:00:29 <steveg>	dcheung, https://access.redhat.com/solutions/431653
Feb 08 15:00:35 <steveg>	Needs one of:
Feb 08 15:00:36 <steveg>	HostAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:36 <steveg>	Cluster Admin
Feb 08 15:00:36 <steveg>	DC Admin
Feb 08 15:00:36 <steveg>	GlusterAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:36 <steveg>	HostAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:38 <steveg>	NetworkAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:40 <steveg>	StorageAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:42 <steveg>	SuperUser
Feb 08 15:00:44 <steveg>	TemplateAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:46 <steveg>	VmPoolAdmin
Feb 08 15:00:54 <steveg>	i would suggest give it Cluster Admin on the EAP cluster specifically
Feb 08 15:01:32 <steveg>	and you know, use a super secure password... ;p
Feb 08 15:05:40 <dcheung>	well we're not using the most common secure password as password this time
Feb 08 15:05:49 <dcheung>	we're using the 2nd most common one
Feb 08 15:06:12 <yobshans>	dcheung, hi, if you use REST API call to /ovirt-engine/api/vms you have to provide "Authorization" in http header as encrypted password such as YWRtaW5AaW50ZXJuYWw6cXVtNW5ldA==
Feb 08 15:06:36 <dcheung>	yobshans: I'm using the ovirt java sdk
Feb 08 15:07:00 <dcheung>	I see something like that when I run the api in debug mode
Feb 08 15:07:14 <yobshans>	dcheung: should b e similar, no?
Feb 08 15:07:59 <dcheung>	yup I guess the sdk is just a wrapper for the REST APIs
Feb 08 15:09:54 <yobshans>	https://www.base64encode.org/
Feb 08 15:10:48 <dcheung>	there's also the base64 command, but the java sdk does the encoding for me
Feb 08 15:22:41 <steveg>	yobshans, it's not the auth that is the issue
Feb 08 15:22:53 <steveg>	yobshans, it's authing but the account needs certain permissions to access the api
Feb 08 15:23:02 <steveg>	yobshans, permissions it did not have
Feb 08 15:27:24 <yobshans>	steveg, ok, I see
Feb 08 15:29:05 <dcheung>	steveg: so I added the Cluster Admin permission, but I couldn't figure out how to add it to the eapbatch user directly. If I instead click on a vm, then on its permissions tab, then I can add that ClusterAdmin permission. it's weird
Feb 08 15:29:13 <dcheung>	but it works! thanks for the help steveg ! :)
Feb 08 15:29:35 <steveg>	dcheung, yeah the permissions are tied to objects
Feb 08 15:29:48 <steveg>	dcheung, so to give it on the cluster you have to select the cluster and go to its permissions tab
Feb 08 15:29:55 <steveg>	dcheung, and add eapbatch there
Feb 08 15:29:59 <steveg>	dcheung, it's a bit roundabout
Feb 08 15:30:17 <dcheung>	ah gotcha, will do that

Feb 09 10:29:32 <patrickm>	chrisphi_: had several westvletern 12 | 8 + corsendonk christmas ales... pmuldoon knocked over a full chalice of westvletern 12... broke the chalice too... it was a sad day
Feb 09 10:29:54 <chrisphi_>	:-(
Feb 09 10:31:09 <chrisphi_>	patrickm: How was the  corsendonk christmas ale?
Feb 09 10:32:19 <patrickm>	chrisphi_: it's one of my favourite ales... not a fan of their pater though
Feb 09 10:32:54 <chrisphi_>	Have to try it sometime....
Feb 09 10:34:35 <patrickm>	chrisphi_: i had to pay out 10 EUR to pmuldoon, I bet him he couldn't drink a full serving of Mort Subite's house gueuze... never bet against a Welshman when beer is concerned, no matter how bad it is 
Feb 09 10:35:06 <patrickm>	[well. 10 EUR == next two rounds]
Feb 09 10:35:18 <chrisphi_>	Ah no wonder he knocked over the chalice, ;-)
Feb 09 11:15:33 <patrickm>	mwringe: https://about.mattermost.com/  to further the conversation
Feb 09 11:16:39 <mwringe>	so its basically a slack clone which is opensource
Feb 09 11:19:16 <steveg>	patrickm, do i need to reserve more or less CPUs for it than the slack client?
Feb 09 11:20:13 <patrickm>	mwringe: there seems to be a few more features as well BUT i don't know if they are useful
Feb 09 11:21:30 <patrickm>	steveg: dunno... matt and i were just talking about xchat/hexchat/slack in the kitchen and i noted that the developer program is moving to mattermost... i have no experience using it
Feb 09 11:23:21 <rgrunber>	eclipse foundation is pushing it to some extent..
Feb 09 11:24:34 <steveg>	patrickm, slack is godawful but since the k8s community is there i am somewhat stuck with it
Feb 09 11:25:31 <patrickm>	rgrunber: are you a mattermost user?
Feb 09 11:26:24 <rgrunber>	no
Feb 09 11:26:36 <patrickm>	steveg: your opinion of slack differs from mwringe's... we must settle this the "Ring of Death"
Feb 09 11:27:13 <steveg>	patrickm, it's not really the slack experience itself that bugs me
Feb 09 11:27:20 <steveg>	patrickm, it's the performance of the linux client
Feb 09 11:28:13 <dcheung>	is it worse than the web interface?
Feb 09 11:38:47 <steveg>	dcheung, it's basically the same but wrapped in its own process
Feb 09 11:39:01 <steveg>	dcheung, so i primarily use it this way so it can be killed separately
Feb 09 11:42:11 <dcheung>	gotcha
Feb 09 12:08:10 <rattapat>	has anybody played with openshift origin? willing to help with a few installation issues? :)
Feb 09 13:11:02 <steveg>	rattapat, barely
Feb 09 13:11:11 <steveg>	rattapat, i've only really used oc cluster up
Feb 09 13:12:33 <dcheung>	jlebon: ^^ ?
Feb 09 13:13:46 <jlebon>	rattapat: i can try, though i mostly use *oc cluster up* as well
Feb 09 13:14:04 <rattapat>	steveg: jlebon I'm struggling with exposing my services deployed on OS. My routing config is wrong or I'm missing a critical piece 
Feb 09 13:15:12 <jlebon>	ahh, heh. btw the kube site has a whole article dedicated to service troubleshooting
Feb 09 13:15:15 <jlebon>	https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/debugging-services/
Feb 09 13:20:29 <dcheung>	rattapat: is it about DNS re-routing to your service?
Feb 09 13:28:42 <rattapat>	dcheung: yes I think so
Feb 09 13:28:47 <rattapat>	jlebon: thanks for the link
Feb 09 13:30:47 <rattapat>	jlebon: btw my understanding is that routers and routes is an openshift concept built on top of kubernetis

Mar 09 08:54:38 <mwringe_>	is zimbra down for anyone else?
Mar 09 09:07:06 <steveg>	mwringe_, yeah
Mar 09 09:07:15 <steveg>	mwringe_, i assume IT is trying to resource starve us to gmail ;p
Mar 09 09:07:27 <mwringe_>	:)
Mar 09 09:07:45 <steveg>	mwringe_, http://post-office.corp.redhat.com/archives/outage-list/2017-March/msg00139.html
Mar 09 09:07:50 <mwringe_>	they are rebooting zimbra since they have been having intermittent issues lately -> http://post-office.corp.redhat.com/archives/outage-list/2017-March/msg00139.html
Mar 09 09:07:55 <steveg>	they are turning it off and on again
Mar 09 09:08:02 <mwringe_>	yeah
Mar 09 09:08:04 <steveg>	>:D
Mar 09 09:08:44 <mwringe_>	turning things off and on again is surprising the recommended solution for most computer issues, which is really sad
Mar 09 09:09:24 <mwringe_>	its even built into Kubernetes/OpenShift as a means of automatically trying to fix problems
Mar 09 09:10:49 <steveg>	my approach in openstack land is to reprovision it and THEN turn it off and on ;p
Mar 09 09:14:35 <rgb>	isn't that part of the the "pets vs cattle" ethos?
Mar 09 09:15:07 <rgb>	so it wasn't just me and zimbra not seeing eye to eye...
Mar 10 11:32:14 <patrickm>	lisac: Jif peanut butter is now available @ Loblaws! 
Mar 10 11:41:03 <lisac>	patrickm, there goes the waistline
Mar 10 11:45:48 <patrickm>	lisac: not a all... just means that I no longer have to stockpile + have folks mule it across the border
Mar 10 11:53:06 <fnasser>	patrickm, lisac We need a Trader Joes in Canada
Mar 10 11:53:35 <fnasser>	patrickm, lisac That is where the things I keep "importing" come from
Mar 10 12:16:59 *	chrisphi_ I think at one point when we were in Massachusetts, we determined that most of the things we bought at TJ were Canadian origin...
Mar 13 10:28:51 <mwringe_>	the boring machines is being brought out of the ground if anyone is interested
Mar 13 10:29:18 <rgrunber>	mwringe_: yeah i heard.. right now ? we have a decent view from your side ?
Mar 13 10:39:41 <steveg>	rgrunber, in pieces between 9-12
Mar 13 10:40:15 <rgrunber>	does this mean all that construction equipment will finally get off our lawn.. ?
Mar 13 10:40:24 <steveg>	rgrunber, probably not lol
Mar 13 10:40:36 <steveg>	rgrunber, just different equipment ! :P
Mar 13 10:40:44 <rgrunber>	yay.. more walking the long way around
Mar 13 10:42:09 <steveg>	rgrunber, i imagine they will fix that up
Mar 13 10:42:29 <steveg>	rgrunber, but i think the utilities relocation stuff at the yonge/eg intersection is still going to be going on for a while

Mar 21 13:57:55 <patrickm>	fche: that's why i was thinking Nov 1... it's about 3 weeks after i started
Mar 21 13:58:14 *	fche will check them email archives
Mar 21 13:59:17 <fche>	hm, even by sep. 23 (my hire date), the 2323 yonge address was known
Mar 21 13:59:49 <fche>	have some emails from karen with that in her email signature, by oct. 6
Mar 21 14:00:01 *	fche would guess Oct 1 rather than Nov
Mar 21 14:04:01 <patrickm>	fche: ok, perhaps they had to do some work on the place... i started in Oct, and used your dining room + stairs for a few weeks... depending on how long the cable was
Mar 21 14:04:13 <fche>	haha
Mar 21 14:04:17 <fche>	those were the days
Mar 21 14:06:39 *	fche seems to have zero photos of the era, bummer
