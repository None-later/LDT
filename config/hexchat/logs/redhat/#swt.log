Jul 27 11:58:48 *	Now talking on #swt
Jul 27 14:07:50 <ipun>	this may seem dumb, but is it correct to why my controlexample is running off of control.class now instead of .java?
Jul 27 14:08:40 <ipun>	my controlexample use to use the fontsize stuff that ive worked on, now its using control.class instead which i didnt touch
Jul 27 14:08:57 <ericwill>	the .class files are generated based on your changes from .java
Jul 27 14:09:11 <ericwill>	so unless you're changes aren't being reflected in the .class files you should be fine
Jul 27 14:09:19 <ericwill>	*your
Jul 27 14:13:57 <ipun>	hmm ok i might have to rebuild then thats probably the issue
Jul 27 14:14:52 <ericwill>	check the Java build path of your controlexample
Jul 27 14:15:01 <ericwill>	is the SWT project on the build path?
Jul 27 14:17:37 <ipun>	wierd enough i dont htink it is anymore...
Jul 27 15:03:46 <ipun>	ericwill looking at the commit, i copied over what its doing and its implementing it correctly with the font sizing
Jul 27 15:03:52 <ipun>	yet override_font() is still bugged
Jul 27 15:04:00 <ipun>	praying GTK looks at this seriously
Jul 27 15:04:11 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 27 15:04:17 <ericwill>	link to the commit?
Jul 27 15:07:49 <ipun>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=99c2423043f0c95a60093c618e00823e42e0ddfa
Jul 27 15:08:08 <ipun>	i implemented it the same way (to follow their way of doing it)
Jul 27 15:08:26 <ipun>	but i just realized this doesnt really have to do with override_font()
Jul 27 15:08:56 <ipun>	the guy just posted it since its just about how CSS is currently updated, but the override_font() i dont think has to do with this commit
Jul 27 15:08:59 <ericwill>	yeah so all that commit does is implement our thing
Jul 27 15:09:05 <ericwill>	i.e. convert from a pango unit to CSS
Jul 27 15:09:14 <ericwill>	which we already implemented :P
Jul 27 15:09:21 <ipun>	yup.
Jul 27 15:09:23 <ericwill>	would have been nice to know this earlier but oh well
Jul 27 15:09:47 <ipun>	sadly, i dont think we can use our code in the end =( since we're probably gonna have to use override_font() if its fixed
Jul 28 09:48:35 <ipun>	ericwill so far the comments on the GTK bug are not useful lol
Jul 28 09:48:49 <ericwill>	ipun yeah I just saw
Jul 28 09:48:59 <ipun>	not sure if Matt understands
Jul 28 09:49:18 <ericwill>	did Alex send you his Menu stuff?
Jul 28 09:50:30 <ipun>	no lemme msg him about that
Jul 28 09:52:52 <ericwill>	kk
Jul 28 10:09:11 <ipun>	should i move on to something else while i wait on GTK and alex?
Jul 28 10:09:25 <ipun>	cept my stack of things im dealing with is getting larger
Jul 28 10:13:18 <ericwill>	ipun I am going to ping them about the font thing
Jul 28 10:13:23 <ericwill>	since the comment wasn't really useful at all
Jul 28 10:14:40 <ipun>	yeah...
Jul 28 10:19:19 <ipun>	ericwill for the measured event loop bug, is this something that might be causing the signal call?
Jul 28 10:19:21 <ipun>	(GtkCellAllocCallback)get_cell_allocation
Jul 28 10:19:33 <ipun>	i forgot if we talked about that 
Jul 28 10:19:41 <ericwill>	ipun no, didn't see that
Jul 28 10:19:43 <ericwill>	looks likely
Jul 28 10:21:20 <ipun>	hmm okay. I looked deeper into that method but it doesnt have any explicit signals
Jul 28 10:21:47 <ericwill>	look in Display.initCallbacks() and see if there are any allocate callbacks
Jul 28 10:21:56 <ericwill>	also look in Tree and see there are any allocate callback methods
Jul 28 10:22:40 <ipun>	kk
Jul 28 10:32:42 <ericwill>	ipun send me the commit for that get_dpi thing
Jul 28 10:32:44 <ericwill>	from matt watson
Jul 28 10:33:04 <ipun>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=df08fc91bdc1d2e4c866122304fabe4dd298a7de
Jul 28 10:33:28 <ipun>	basically we need their override_font() to use that calculation
Jul 28 10:33:38 <ipun>	if we do that, it will fix it
Jul 28 10:33:49 <ericwill>	okay I think we are making progress
Jul 28 11:58:36 <ipun>	dispaly.initCallback has some callbacks like size_allocate
Jul 28 11:58:55 <ipun>	thats the only one though
Jul 28 12:02:05 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 28 12:04:23 <ipun>	ericwill: patch went out okay?
Jul 28 12:04:27 <ipun>	ill comment on the bug then
Jul 28 12:04:43 <ericwill>	ipun just commented lol, no need
Jul 28 12:04:46 <ipun>	okay
Jul 28 12:04:50 <ericwill>	we have a patch but I'm just waiting for him to commit it
Jul 28 12:05:37 <ipun>	how about on bugzilla?
Jul 28 12:08:39 <ericwill>	wait for the GTK bug to get fixed and then we can mark the Eclipse bug as fixed and link the commit
Jul 28 12:10:37 <ipun>	kk
Jul 28 13:57:25 <ericwill>	so that font bug is fixed and merged in GTK now
Jul 28 13:57:26 <ericwill>	all good
Jul 28 14:39:07 <ericwill>	ipun if you are ever bored/want something you don't have to think a lot about, make a bugzilla filter for all open SWT bugs and go through them
Jul 28 14:39:17 <ericwill>	close the ones which aren't relevant/can't reproduce
Jul 28 14:39:21 <ericwill>	to keep the BZ tidy
Jul 28 14:39:26 <ipun>	oaky
Jul 28 14:39:30 <ipun>	okay*
Jul 28 14:48:21 <ipun>	ericwill doesnt look like nulling the proc actually turns it off
Jul 28 14:57:22 <ericwill>	ipun hmm
Jul 28 14:57:30 <ericwill>	is there a method somewhere that destroys them or something?
Jul 28 15:05:01 <ipun>	ericwill theres a method called setEnabled from callback class, but i tried it and it doesnt seem to work
Jul 28 15:05:17 <ipun>	... wat
Jul 28 15:05:19 <ipun>	wait*
Jul 28 15:06:21 <ipun>	hahahaahah
Jul 28 15:06:26 <ipun>	it works
Jul 28 15:06:30 <ericwill>	okay :P
Jul 28 15:06:47 <ipun>	i just had to move the reenabling of it lower
Jul 28 15:06:53 <ipun>	lemme test around with it and we're good
Jul 28 15:57:16 <ipun>	hey lufimtse im still having issues compiling gtk for some reason with jhbuild... besides cancelling it and rebuilding again, did you find any other solution>
Jul 28 15:57:34 <lufimtse>	hey
Jul 28 16:18:48 <lufimtse>	ipun, what was the exact command we used again?
Jul 28 16:19:01 <lufimtse>	jhbuild buildone --force gtk+ ?
Jul 28 16:22:01 <ipun>	yeah thats it
Jul 28 16:25:09 <ericwill>	ipun please post on the platform-ui-dev mailing list and ask someone to review this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77096/
Jul 28 16:25:33 <ericwill>	ipun also take a look at this guy: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=493357
Jul 28 16:27:31 <ericwill>	I started work on that but I won't be able to finish it in time before I leave
Jul 28 16:27:55 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill I've updated the wiki: https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT/Devel/Gtk/jhbuild#Building_different_versions_of_gtk_.28or_compiling_your_changes.29
Jul 28 16:28:10 <lufimtse>	What you want is: 
Jul 28 16:28:10 <lufimtse>	 jhbuild buildone --force --no-network --distclean gtk+
Jul 28 16:28:25 <lufimtse>	the --distclean is especially needed if you go back to an older gtk version. 
Jul 28 16:28:45 <ipun>	it looks like someone broke a junit case in master
Jul 28 16:29:01 <lufimtse>	ipun, which one?
Jul 28 16:29:09 <ipun>	test_getPrinterList
Jul 28 16:29:20 <ipun>	unless its local
Jul 28 16:29:42 <lufimtse>	doesn't work on my system if I have a printer
Jul 28 16:29:53 <lufimtse>	stopped working somewhere in Gtk3.18
Jul 28 16:30:03 <ipun>	oh i see
Jul 28 16:30:04 <lufimtse>	I've been meaning to file a bug for it
Jul 28 16:30:11 <lufimtse>	maybe something for you to work on. 
Jul 28 16:30:13 <ipun>	ill ignore it for now
Jul 28 16:30:21 <lufimtse>	do you have a printer on your system?
Jul 28 16:30:34 <ipun>	ya
Jul 28 16:30:41 <ipun>	i just added it like a week ago though
Jul 28 16:33:45 <lufimtse>	that's probably why the jUnit fails
Jul 28 16:33:52 <lufimtse>	if you have time, feel free to investigate sometime
Jul 28 16:33:59 <lufimtse>	would be useful to have it fixed.
Jul 28 16:34:10 <lufimtse>	afaik it doesn't reproduce with gtk3.16 and before
Jul 28 16:34:13 <lufimtse>	so might be gtk bug.

Jul 29 11:38:32 <ipun>	lufimtse looks like the printerlist bug in our test case is really broken logic, techincally none of it shouldve passed
Jul 29 11:39:05 <lufimtse>	lol
Jul 29 15:28:33 <ipun>	ericwill should I be replacing all the gtk calls to that function to my private one? Im not sure if this is what we should do
Jul 29 15:28:58 <ericwill>	your private method is just a wrapper
Jul 29 15:29:01 <ericwill>	for the GTK call
Jul 29 15:29:07 <ericwill>	with the callback.setEnabled() in it
Jul 29 15:32:04 <ipun>	yeah i know, im just curious if its necessary to do that for every call that uses that function
Jul 29 15:32:19 <ericwill>	we should
Jul 29 15:32:39 <ericwill>	because if someone wants to use one of those methods in a measure event, the same bug will come up
Jul 29 15:33:48 <ipun>	oaky sounds good
Jul 29 15:34:18 <ipun>	i might have to implement it in Control and Widget as well, since Tree is a subclass of Control but Treeitem is a widget subclass
Jul 29 15:35:39 <ericwill>	ipun nah just do it in Control then
Jul 29 15:35:45 <ericwill>	sorry, widget
Jul 29 15:35:50 <ericwill>	all Controls are widgets
Jul 29 15:38:16 <ipun>	ah your right sorry i misread it 
Jul 29 16:29:25 <ipun>	ericwill how do you generate a new changeset number again? I tried pushing my changes but the changeset was closed already.
Jul 29 16:29:41 <ericwill>	before amending the commit, click the gerrit button in egit
Jul 29 16:29:50 <ericwill>	should give you something with multiple zeros
Jul 29 16:29:57 <ericwill>	copy and paste that and use it for your new change
Jul 29 16:32:15 <ipun>	nice thanks!

Aug 03 16:34:42 <ericwill>	check preferences
Aug 04 11:01:26 <ipun>	ericwill: for the setVisible bug you assigned me, seems like a GTK error. Documentation of gtk_window_get_position() says its really unaccurate and that its not 100% reliable
Aug 04 11:01:53 <ericwill>	ipun then close it as such with a link to the documentation

Aug 11 17:07:49 <ipun>	kk
Aug 12 09:14:43 <ericwill>	lufimtse hey...when you're around I have a question
Aug 12 09:58:47 <lufimtse>	ericwill, hullo
Aug 12 09:59:13 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I miss your company already X-D
Aug 12 09:59:24 <lufimtse>	wanted to complain about my landlady to you.
Aug 12 09:59:42 <ericwill>	haha yeah, working from home is kinda lonely
Aug 12 09:59:44 <ericwill>	the sleep is nice though
Aug 12 09:59:52 <ericwill>	what did your landlady do?
Aug 12 10:00:02 <lufimtse>	It's like when I was suggesting to you to use certain tools (emacs), she is suggesting me to organise my room in a certain way. Man she's driving me mad ^____^.
Aug 12 10:00:14 <lufimtse>	Boy I have learned
Aug 12 10:00:47 <ericwill>	lol, that seems like an odd thing for a landlady to be involved in -.-
Aug 12 10:04:19 <ericwill>	btw lufimtse I tested your sysdeps script...works very well
Aug 12 10:04:55 <ericwill>	might be useful to note that after using sysdeps, you can only use the build.sh once you've renamed your .classpath_gtk in the SWT git repo
Aug 12 10:05:39 <lufimtse>	I was thinking of fixing that up... hmmm
Aug 12 10:05:52 <lufimtse>	I could add a check?
Aug 12 10:06:35 <lufimtse>	like ask user "no .classpath found, would you like to copy .classpath_gtk to .classpath? [y/n]"
Aug 12 10:06:37 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Aug 12 10:08:06 <xipun>	wait lufimtse why is your landlady giving you pointers about your room
Aug 12 10:09:20 <lufimtse>	Some of the furniture is hers
Aug 12 10:09:41 <lufimtse>	We have a friendly relationship, but her micro-management is somewhat intense..
Aug 12 10:09:52 <lufimtse>	also I'm not that clean, she is a obsessive about cleaning
Aug 12 10:10:04 <lufimtse>	I have stuff lying around my room, kinda like on my desk.
Aug 12 10:10:18 <lufimtse>	she's like, "you should put the things you don't use into the garage"
Aug 12 10:10:25 <lufimtse>	me like "i'm quite happy with my room the way it is"
Aug 12 10:10:49 <lufimtse>	tensions eventually escalate, 
Aug 12 10:11:08 <lufimtse>	grr
Aug 12 10:11:14 <lufimtse>	need to let off some steam lol ^_^
Aug 12 10:11:32 <ericwill>	oh lols
Aug 12 10:11:38 <ericwill>	yeah that would be annoying
Aug 12 10:12:48 <ericwill>	lufimtse re: the sysdeps thing, you could check and print something, but offering to copy it makes the assumption that you've checked out the git repo already
Aug 12 10:12:55 <ericwill>	which is fine by me actually
Aug 12 10:13:41 <lufimtse>	good idea. 
Aug 12 10:13:56 <lufimtse>	very unintrusive
Aug 12 10:14:58 <ericwill>	I like the script, saved me a lot of time
Aug 12 10:17:08 <ericwill>	also lufimtse, did you by any chance document that bit about the "fetch from gerrit" menu missing? I ran into the same issue on my machine at home, can't remember how you got it to work
Aug 12 10:43:56 <lufimtse>	humms
Aug 12 10:44:39 <lufimtse>	not in public wiki, but let me check my private wiki

Aug 12 10:55:01 <ericwill>	lufimtse okay will try it out, thanks
Aug 12 11:04:22 <ericwill>	lufimtse hmm so all I needed to do was select the http option with no username
Aug 12 11:04:27 <ericwill>	i.e.: http://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git
Aug 12 11:04:39 <lufimtse>	let me check
Aug 12 11:05:01 <lufimtse>	ssh://lufimtsev@git.eclipse.org:29418/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git
Aug 12 11:05:06 <lufimtse>	avoid the 'gitroot' one
Aug 12 11:05:24 <lufimtse>	I also copied SSH keys to the right places
Aug 12 11:05:42 <lufimtse>	I keep my SSH key in my google drive and then copy it to my machine when needed
Aug 12 11:05:50 <lufimtse>	or generate new key and put to eclipse org
Aug 12 11:06:06 <ericwill>	ah okay
Aug 12 11:06:32 <lufimtse>	http://storage8.static.itmages.com/i/16/0812/h_1471014423_5798266_dffa5947e3.png
Aug 12 11:06:34 <lufimtse>	when I push
Aug 12 11:06:45 <lufimtse>	for review
Aug 12 11:07:01 <lufimtse>	you may have to tinker with .git/config
Aug 12 11:07:05 <lufimtse>	and stuff gerrit in there
Aug 12 11:07:13 <lufimtse>	do you need my copy of the .git/config?
Aug 12 11:07:25 <ericwill>	no no
Aug 12 11:07:31 <ericwill>	I copied the one from my work machine, seems to work
Aug 12 11:08:10 <ericwill>	also the ssh works for me now too, just had to remove gitroot from the URI
Aug 12 11:08:12 <ericwill>	all good
Aug 12 11:22:19 <lufimtse>	kewl
Aug 12 11:22:34 <lufimtse>	I should document it
Aug 12 11:22:48 <lufimtse>	originally you helped me with finding that one had to get rid of 'gitroot',
Aug 12 11:23:49 <ericwill>	yup
Aug 12 11:23:56 <ericwill>	and now I had totally forgotten it
Aug 12 11:24:04 <ericwill>	this is why it's important to document :P
Aug 12 11:38:45 <ericwill>	ipun is this for review? https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78969/
Aug 12 11:39:18 <ipun>	oh woops sorry i forgot to tag the WIP on it
Aug 12 11:39:23 <ipun>	im just running the tests on it now
Aug 12 11:39:26 <ericwill>	kk
Aug 12 11:40:16 <lufimtse>	After I push stage 1 of the webkit business, I'll tryina invest sometime into more documentation and blogging
Aug 12 11:40:36 <lufimtse>	I've been somewhat happy with my zim and been lazy about putting things into public wiki
Aug 12 11:40:47 <lufimtse>	:-3
Aug 12 11:40:54 <lufimtse>	I'm so bad.
Aug 12 11:42:51 <ipun>	lufimtse im having issues compiling eclipse after running your build script =(
Aug 12 11:43:04 <lufimtse>	X-D
Aug 12 11:43:08 <lufimtse>	let's investigate
Aug 12 11:43:59 <ericwill>	ipun are you by any chance getting: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.OS.setenv([B[BI)I
Aug 12 11:48:41 <ericwill>	lufimtse it looks like your commit yesterday to the build script broke something
Aug 12 11:48:46 <ericwill>	reverting it fixes it for me
Aug 12 11:58:47 <lufimtse>	it's the commit after my commit
Aug 12 11:58:51 <lufimtse>	sravan's changes to c.c
Aug 12 11:58:55 <lufimtse>	ericwill, 
Aug 12 11:58:59 <lufimtse>	Investigating
Aug 12 11:59:11 <lufimtse>	BUT FIRST
Aug 12 11:59:12 <ericwill>	hmm
Aug 12 11:59:13 <lufimtse>	Tea.
Aug 12 11:59:50 <ericwill>	okay makes sense actually
Aug 12 12:03:35 <lufimtse>	of course,
Aug 12 12:03:45 <lufimtse>	drinking tea before tacking a problem always makes sense.
Aug 12 12:04:31 <ericwill>	:D
Aug 12 12:07:41 <ipun>	well my patch works if rebased on a previous commit
Aug 12 12:07:48 <ipun>	tried on all versions, it looks good now
Aug 12 12:08:32 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill I'm investigating the setenv business, will post in bug or on dev-list
Aug 12 12:08:46 <ericwill>	kk
Aug 12 12:51:11 <lufimtse>	ericwill|lunch, ipun I figured it out. the first static initializer in OS.java calls OS.setenv(..) before the library is loaded.
Aug 12 13:25:54 <ericwill>	oh lord
Aug 12 13:25:58 <ericwill>	rebooted over lunch
Aug 12 13:26:05 <ericwill>	forgot I had removed my boot partition
Aug 12 13:26:07 <ericwill>	had to re-install grub
Aug 12 13:30:57 <ipun>	did you let svan know lufimtse ?
Aug 12 13:36:57 <ipun>	:qq
Aug 12 13:37:02 <ipun>	woops sorry
Aug 12 13:44:56 <lufimtse>	ipun, I posted in the bug, investigating fix.
Aug 12 14:51:27 <ericwill>	lufimtse are you okay with me merging that sysdeps thing?
Aug 12 15:03:32 <lufimtse>	sec
Aug 12 15:03:39 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I'm still adding the .class thing check
Aug 12 15:03:43 <lufimtse>	I wrote it, just need to push it.
Aug 12 15:03:56 <lufimtse>	twiddling with hi-dpi unsat.link error.
Aug 12 15:03:59 <lufimtse>	atm
Aug 12 15:04:06 <ericwill>	yeah that error is annoying
Aug 12 15:04:11 <ericwill>	I just reverted it locally
Aug 12 15:34:02 <lufimtse>	ericwill, ipun, I submitted a patch, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78989/
Aug 12 15:34:15 <lufimtse>	I'm awaiting Niraj or Sravan to review and push to master.
Aug 12 15:34:45 <ericwill>	lufimtse saw it, looks good from my end
Aug 12 15:34:52 <ericwill>	sadly they are in India and probably in bed already
Aug 12 15:34:56 <ericwill>	so we don't get a fix till Monday
Aug 12 15:35:00 <lufimtse>	If they haven't done it by monday evening, I'll just push it myself...

Aug 17 10:34:52 <ipun>	for bug 182598, Im wondering if I should close it as unfixed or not. This has to do with how SWT is handling listeners; basically the item is destroyed before a method in the callback is ran
Aug 17 10:35:06 <ipun>	im not entirely sure how to fix this
Aug 17 10:36:50 <ericwill>	ipun the item is destroyed before the callback?
Aug 17 10:36:58 <ipun>	yeah
Aug 17 10:37:52 <ipun>	it crashes at tree.setItemCount(1)
Aug 17 10:38:08 <ipun>	its during the second event trigger 
Aug 17 10:38:46 <ericwill>	where in setItemCount does it crash?
Aug 17 10:40:26 <ipun>	i cant actually tell. It offsets the process so its done later
Aug 17 10:40:59 <ipun>	running a debug through the method is fine, but once it leaves and trys to finish the rest of the app, it crashes
Aug 17 10:41:11 <ipun>	i also noticed changed it to setItemCount(2) works fine

Aug 29 11:55:41 <lufimtse>	ok
Aug 29 11:55:44 <lufimtse>	test hard my friend.

Aug 30 14:58:25 <ipun>	lufimtse hey i think i found the commit causing it through git blame, how do i switch to that exact commit again?
Aug 30 14:58:35 <ipun>	or is there a way to search git history?

Aug 30 15:12:29 <ipun>	yeah thats it
Aug 30 15:12:29 <lufimtse>	yea, seems like it.
Aug 30 15:12:33 <lufimtse>	I'm reading up on it.
Aug 30 15:16:23 <ipun>	sadly not very useful considering it has no commit message...
Aug 30 15:31:15 <lufimtse>	LD_LIBRARY_PATH/home/lufimtse/git/swt_dev_tools/gtk_builds/3.06
Aug 30 15:31:26 <lufimtse>	except lufimtse -> ipun
Aug 30 16:12:28 <lufimtse>	ipun, btw, to copy workspace across, I used:
Aug 30 16:12:29 <lufimtse>	rsync -avzh /home/lufimtse/workspace_neon/ ~/workspace
Aug 30 16:12:32 <lufimtse>	from host to vm
Aug 30 16:12:38 <lufimtse>	as per
Aug 30 16:12:39 <lufimtse>	http://www.tecmint.com/rsync-local-remote-file-synchronization-commands/
Aug 30 16:12:45 <lufimtse>	That way the vm uses a copy of the workspace
Aug 30 16:12:56 <lufimtse>	I just re-run the command to get a fresh copy of the workspace
Aug 30 16:13:15 <lufimtse>	the nice thing is that it just sync the changes, so it's fast if you have a big workspace. (mine is like 1.5 gb).
Aug 30 16:18:13 <ipun>	nice thanks! ive just basically copied over another workspace and renamed it somethjing else, but this definitely would be useful for syncing

Sep 01 10:54:24 <ericwill>	that comment is so useful
Sep 01 10:54:47 <ericwill>	if that ends up being true we should replace all instances of gdk_screen_get_monitor_at_window() with that
Sep 01 10:55:33 <ericwill>	that would fix https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=494771 as well
Sep 01 10:58:10 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 01 10:58:19 <lufimtse>	ipun, sup
Sep 01 10:58:48 <lufimtse>	ipun, change bug id in title, make a new change id
Sep 01 10:58:59 <lufimtse>	that should create new gerrit review.
Sep 01 11:17:19 <ipun>	ericwill thanks for the comment, that does indeed get the correct monitor
Sep 01 11:17:29 <ipun>	however, its still painting in the wrong place
Sep 01 11:17:33 <ipun>	working on finding why its doing that
Sep 01 11:18:00 <ericwill>	ipun look at ToolTip.drawTooltip()
Sep 01 11:38:30 <ipun>	have any of you guys had issues with eclipse causing your whole computer to slow down for like 2 minutes and crash
Sep 01 11:38:33 <ipun>	ive had that happen once in a while
Sep 01 11:41:32 <ericwill>	hmm
Sep 01 11:41:34 <ericwill>	nope
Sep 01 11:58:52 <ipun>	ericwill so i fixed it, but because of nonexistant documentation, i have no idea how
Sep 01 11:59:52 <ipun>	in configure () theres soooo many numbers that have no meaning
Sep 01 12:09:36 <ericwill>	ipun throw the patch onto gerrit I'll take a look
Sep 01 12:10:00 <ericwill>	oh god, looking at tooltip.configure()...
Sep 01 12:10:07 <ericwill>	what is happening here
Sep 01 12:10:38 <ericwill>	I don't think these numbers affect us, just the monitor bits
Sep 01 12:18:37 <ipun>	ericwill k i found out whats going on
Sep 01 12:18:42 <ipun>	its actually f rom configure()
Sep 01 12:18:46 <ipun>	i fixed it from there
Sep 01 12:18:56 <ipun>	i have an idea on how to fix, just needs some time

Sep 01 15:25:44 <ipun>	its annoying because GTK sees a certain monitor as 1 but its not primary in my setup
Sep 01 15:25:54 <ipun>	like, from the OS you can switch it
Sep 01 15:26:07 <ipun>	so now im trying to figure out how to get it working correctly
Sep 01 15:26:30 <ericwill>	yeah it's tricky

Sep 07 17:25:45 <lufimtse>	ipun, not afaik, but he seems to be on mattermost # Platform
Sep 08 12:13:23 <ipun>	lufimtse could you help me set up my gerrit for another repo im working on?
Sep 08 12:13:28 <ipun>	i forggot some of the steps
Sep 08 12:13:33 <lufimtse>	ipun, hey
Sep 08 12:13:34 <lufimtse>	sure
Sep 08 12:13:34 <lufimtse>	sec
Sep 08 12:25:01 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun looks like the SWT JUnit tests are broken on GTK3 for master
Sep 08 12:25:05 <ericwill>	can any of you confirm
Sep 08 12:27:21 <ericwill>	oh wait nvm
Sep 08 12:27:23 <ericwill>	I got it to work
Sep 08 12:27:26 <ericwill>	disregard :)
Sep 08 13:30:41 <lufimtse>	ericwill, :-3
Sep 08 13:31:15 <lufimtse>	I spoke with Stefan Xenos on Mattermost today, it was nice to actually be able to reach out and chat to other swt developers
Sep 08 13:31:31 <lufimtse>	too bad people don't seem to gravitate thowards freenode#swt
Sep 08 13:31:32 <lufimtse>	oh well.
Sep 08 13:41:54 <ericwill>	lufimtse yeah I'm going to download it today and check it out
Sep 08 14:08:51 <lufimtse>	kewl
Sep 08 14:09:22 <ipun>	whats next?
Sep 08 14:12:02 <ericwill>	ipun I sent you some emails
Sep 08 14:12:28 <ipun>	ericwill i gottem thanks! sorry i was asking "whats next" to leo
Sep 08 14:12:33 <ipun>	lufimtse^
Sep 08 14:12:37 <ericwill>	ipun ah lol, np
Sep 08 14:12:38 <ipun>	my eclipse has ded
Sep 08 14:22:28 <lufimtse>	@ipun, Guide on how to setup Eclipse to run nightly: https://coffeeorientedprogramming.com/2016/09/08/running-nightly-eclipse-for-the-impatient/
Sep 08 14:29:26 <ipun>	thank you!
Sep 08 14:31:58 <ericwill>	that's it for me today, talk to you guys later
Sep 08 14:32:03 <lufimtse>	ericwill, kk
Sep 08 14:32:07 <lufimtse>	have nice 1
Sep 08 14:32:14 <lufimtse>	ipun, lemme know if you get stuck somewhere
Sep 08 14:32:20 <ericwill>	lufimtse you too :)
Sep 08 14:32:32 <lufimtse>	you will need to download all the relevant 'mylyn' plugins (with gerrit integration)
Sep 08 14:32:55 <lufimtse>	Setting up a new workspace might not be a bad idea, to have a fresh start.
Sep 08 14:33:09 <lufimtse>	But the existing one should theoretically get the job done as well.
Sep 08 14:33:56 <ipun>	hokay
Sep 08 14:39:45 <ipun>	lufimtse which stuff from mylyn do i need?
Sep 08 14:40:01 <ipun>	klike
Sep 08 14:40:05 <ipun>	whats "relevent"
Sep 08 14:44:10 <ipun>	also im still having that same issue. I know eric and I figured it out a while back it had to do with some config file
Sep 08 15:14:55 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 08 15:15:06 <lufimtse>	lemme checks.
Sep 09 10:04:27 <ericwill>	morning ipun 
Sep 09 10:04:37 <ipun>	hello ericwill
Sep 09 10:05:34 <ericwill>	hello, looks like the focus patch got reverted
Sep 09 10:05:39 *	ericwill sighs
Sep 09 10:05:46 <ericwill>	you win some you lose some haha
Sep 09 10:06:06 <ipun>	i know =(
Sep 09 10:06:52 <ericwill>	looks like we need to start running the JFace tests at least once on patches
Sep 09 10:06:57 <ericwill>	which is annoying but necessary I suppose
Sep 09 10:07:11 <ipun>	lufimtse, would you be able to add that to your test script?
Sep 09 10:07:53 <ericwill>	I don't think so
Sep 09 10:08:01 <ericwill>	the test script is located in the SWT repo
Sep 09 10:08:35 <ericwill>	though maybe an optional "run jface tests too" flag/option could be added
Sep 09 10:13:54 <ipun>	yeah true
Sep 09 10:14:10 <ipun>	lemme try to fix the test suite stuff
Sep 09 10:14:28 <ericwill>	np
Sep 09 10:14:48 <ericwill>	might be worth it to write a bunch of test cases and put them into the SWT test suite too
Sep 09 10:24:17 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill, it's potentially possible to add jface stuff to the script.
Sep 09 10:24:29 <lufimtse>	the only thing it would take much much longer to execute
Sep 09 10:24:47 <ipun>	set it as a flag lufimtse 
Sep 09 10:24:49 <ericwill>	^
Sep 09 10:24:56 <ericwill>	-J or something
Sep 09 10:25:03 <lufimtse>	unless I make it so that it only runs one gtk version for jFace, and many for gtk
Sep 09 10:25:09 <ipun>	considering that it needs to be run anyways, running the thing on a VM would be the best
Sep 09 10:25:36 <lufimtse>	or a selector, which versions to test with jface, which versions to test with swt
Sep 09 10:26:03 <lufimtse>	From technical side, can be done. 
Sep 09 10:26:04 <ericwill>	lufimtse a selector sounds good. By default you could have it run the JFace tests with the same GTK3 version as the build machine
Sep 09 10:26:09 <ericwill>	(3.10 I think)
Sep 09 10:26:39 <lufimtse>	another option is to figure out how to run maven from command line, 
Sep 09 10:26:51 <lufimtse>	then run gtk_version_test && maven on jface
Sep 09 10:27:02 <lufimtse>	maven does testing
Sep 09 10:27:19 <lufimtse>	we can then pre-load LD_LIBRARY_PATH before maven runs
Sep 09 10:47:28 <ipun>	also ericwill, it kinda coordinates with how you told me the focus fix could have a test suite on it
Sep 09 10:48:00 <ericwill>	ipun yeah, now you can do the fix and add the test suites at the same time :)
Sep 09 11:19:13 <lufimtse>	ericwill, How do I test the project in here? : https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497812
Sep 09 11:19:22 <lufimtse>	I open child eclipse, but can't find any extra views
Sep 09 11:19:51 <ericwill>	lufimtse are you sure the new child eclipse is running with that plugin enabled?
Sep 09 11:21:55 <lufimtse>	Oh, I think it has some dependencies
Sep 09 11:22:03 <lufimtse>	org.eclipse.e4.core.di
Sep 09 11:22:04 <lufimtse>	meh
Sep 09 11:22:14 <lufimtse>	did you have to import those?
Sep 09 11:24:03 <lufimtse>	hmm, can't get the thing to work. Hmmmz
Sep 09 11:24:10 <ericwill>	I didn't run that project
Sep 09 11:24:43 <ericwill>	oh wait
Sep 09 11:24:45 *	ericwill checks
Sep 09 11:26:03 <lufimtse>	ericwill, oh, never mind
Sep 09 11:26:08 <lufimtse>	It's an RCP application
Sep 09 11:26:19 <lufimtse>	I went to com.vogella.eclipse.dndcontrols.product
Sep 09 11:26:25 <lufimtse>	clicked on "Launch an Eclipse application", 
Sep 09 11:26:28 <lufimtse>	snippet fired up.
Sep 09 11:26:39 <ericwill>	yes I just discovered this also lol
Sep 09 11:28:02 <ericwill>	lufimtse is that thing related to tracker/parts business?
Sep 09 11:28:07 <ericwill>	because the fix for that bug got merged already
Sep 09 11:28:31 <lufimtse>	No, but the fix contains instanceof
Sep 09 11:28:33 <lufimtse>	which is evil
Sep 09 11:29:06 <ericwill>	yeah I saw that
Sep 09 11:29:12 <ericwill>	I think in this case it is necessary though
Sep 09 11:29:38 <ericwill>	and since the instanceof is checking for Composite in Composite.java, I'm okay with it
Sep 09 11:30:08 <lufimtse>	Well, I beg to differ :-)
Sep 09 11:30:16 <lufimtse>	I'll submit a followup patch.
Sep 09 11:30:23 <ericwill>	what are your concerns?
Sep 09 11:31:53 <lufimtse>	Well, 
Sep 09 11:32:00 <lufimtse>	I'll submit patch, you'll see.
Sep 09 11:32:17 <ericwill>	ok
Sep 09 11:43:58 <ericwill>	lufimtse ah good call
Sep 09 11:44:01 <ericwill>	that patch looks good to me
Sep 09 11:44:04 <ericwill>	shall I merge?
Sep 09 11:47:00 <lufimtse>	Let's wait a day.
Sep 09 11:47:07 <lufimtse>	Then merge tomorrow if no objections.
Sep 09 11:47:15 <lufimtse>	Just to allow people to see it.
Sep 09 11:47:24 <lufimtse>	I'll followup on the bug.
Sep 09 11:47:34 <ericwill>	tomorrow is saturday :P
Sep 09 11:47:39 <ericwill>	also Monday is the code freeze for M2
Sep 09 11:47:50 <ericwill>	so if you want to wait that's fine but it will have to wait till M3
Sep 09 11:48:04 <lufimtse>	oh
Sep 09 11:48:10 <lufimtse>	thanks for pointing it out.
Sep 09 11:48:15 <lufimtse>	Hmmmmzzz
Sep 09 11:48:20 <ericwill>	I'm fine with waiting
Sep 09 11:48:22 <ericwill>	it's not urgen
Sep 09 11:48:25 <ericwill>	*urgent
Sep 09 11:48:35 <lufimtse>	Let's merge at 5pm today :-)
Sep 09 11:48:51 <ericwill>	okay you do it, I won't be on
Sep 09 11:49:03 <lufimtse>	ok, if you could +1 it...
Sep 09 11:49:06 <lufimtse>	that'd be great.
Sep 09 11:49:25 <lufimtse>	thanks for being on IRC.
Sep 09 11:49:29 <lufimtse>	~good karma.
Sep 09 11:49:59 <ericwill>	np haha
Sep 09 11:50:05 <ericwill>	good catch btw
Sep 09 11:50:12 <ericwill>	didn't think of markLayout()
Sep 09 11:52:43 <ipun>	ericwill when i run the Test_org_eclipse_swt_custom_Ccombo test it seems to pass
Sep 09 11:52:54 <ipun>	i wonder whats causing the null exception...
Sep 09 11:53:11 <ericwill>	ipun do the JFace tests fail for you locally?
Sep 09 11:53:35 <ipun>	ericwill im actually trying to figure our why none of my Jface tests are running right now ==
Sep 09 11:53:44 <lufimtse>	X-D
Sep 09 11:53:54 <lufimtse>	lemme knows if u need helpz
Sep 09 11:54:03 <ipun>	kk
Sep 09 11:54:03 <ericwill>	I mean, you gotta crawl before you can walk :D
Sep 09 12:20:01 <ipun>	ericwill lufimtse am i the only one getting failures in Jface from master branches?
Sep 09 12:20:47 <ericwill>	last time I checked a few weeks back I got some
Sep 09 12:28:22 <ipun>	hmm okay
Sep 09 12:31:17 <ipun>	ericwill i ran the jface stuff with my focus bug, doesnt seem to be a jface error =S i wonder whats causing that null exception
Sep 09 12:33:24 <ericwill>	ask Alex or lufimtse if they can reproduce the bug locally
Sep 09 12:33:47 <lufimtse>	meh?
Sep 09 12:33:50 <lufimtse>	what goes on
Sep 09 12:34:05 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun is having trouble reproducing a test failure on his machine
Sep 09 12:34:23 <lufimtse>	ericwill, do you know how the javadoc thing is constructed? is it physically using a tooltop or some browser?
Sep 09 12:34:35 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's a Browser widget
Sep 09 12:34:46 <ericwill>	it has nothing to with ToolTip.java
Sep 09 12:34:47 <lufimtse>	Do you know where to find the source?
Sep 09 12:35:06 <ericwill>	yeah it's in the JDT source code
Sep 09 12:35:20 <lufimtse>	ericwill, if it is not a tooltip, what is it? Is it a content assistant?
Sep 09 12:35:37 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's a Browser that's been shrunk down and renders HTML
Sep 09 12:35:51 <ericwill>	if you run a child eclipse and set a breakpoint in Browser.java you can see the stack trace
Sep 09 12:36:07 <lufimtse>	ah
Sep 09 12:36:22 <lufimtse>	but from a theoretical point of view, how would we call that thing?
Sep 09 12:36:30 <lufimtse>	that 'construct'?
Sep 09 12:36:37 <lufimtse>	it's not a tooltip, it's a .......
Sep 09 12:36:39 <lufimtse>	fill in dots
Sep 09 12:36:41 <ericwill>	I would call it a popup browser
Sep 09 12:36:55 <ericwill>	just like the quick outline is popup tree, etc.
Sep 09 12:37:49 <lufimtse>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window ?
Sep 09 12:37:55 <lufimtse>	I wanna argue with Dani mergerd
Sep 09 12:38:09 <lufimtse>	Megert*
Sep 09 12:38:46 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's not even a modal window because it doesn't prevent you from clicking the main Eclipse window while it's open
Sep 09 12:39:01 <ericwill>	it's literally a small widget that pops up and is clickable, and disappears if you click outside of it
Sep 09 12:39:10 <ericwill>	calling it a tooltip is just wrong lol
Sep 09 12:39:23 <lufimtse>	yea, I'm looking for a name to call it, would you refer to it as a modal_window?
Sep 09 12:39:40 <ericwill>	no
Sep 09 12:39:46 <ericwill>	modal windows disable the parent window
Sep 09 12:39:58 <ericwill>	the javadoc tooltip doesn't disable the parent Eclipse window while it's open
Sep 09 12:40:15 <lufimtse>	I see
Sep 09 12:40:15 <lufimtse>	hmm
Sep 09 12:40:38 <ipun>	lufimtse ill ask you about the errors later
Sep 09 12:40:44 <ipun>	doesnt seem to be happening on my machine or my VM
Sep 09 12:43:44 <ericwill>	lufimtse I would just argue to him that it's simply a small widget
Sep 09 12:43:55 <ericwill>	and that because of that it should at the very least have COLOR_WIDGET_* colors
Sep 09 12:44:05 <ericwill>	since it doesn't have any of the properties of a tooltip like I mentioned
Sep 09 12:46:12 <lufimtse>	ericwill, what color should it have?
Sep 09 12:46:54 <ericwill>	lufimtse it should have the same colors as a normal browser widget IMO
Sep 09 12:47:00 <ericwill>	so look in ControlExample
Sep 09 12:47:02 <ericwill>	whatever that is
Sep 09 12:47:24 <ericwill>	I think it's COLOR_WIDGET_BACKGROUND for the controls and COLOR_LIST_BACKGROUND for the content rendering area
Sep 09 12:49:42 <ericwill>	anyways lufimtse I have to run, we'll chat more next week
Sep 09 12:49:45 <ericwill>	have a good weekend :)
Sep 09 12:49:55 <lufimtse>	ericwill, thank you for feedback, have a nice one.
Sep 09 12:50:05 <lufimtse>	looking forward to having u back in office.
Sep 09 12:50:21 <ericwill>	lufimtse I know, me too. IRC is tedious -.-

Sep 09 15:01:39 <ipun>	hey lufimtse so i cant replicate the issue with the focus fix
Sep 09 15:01:54 <ipun>	not sure why, apparently it was erroring on the nightly

Sep 12 16:22:22 <ipun>	lufimtse: i realize right now date time works in a really wierd way when you do on click changes (typing it in on your own). Do you remmber any bug IDs that you worked on relating to it?
Sep 12 16:23:49 <lufimtse>	hey

Sep 12 16:26:29 <lufimtse>	Anatoly started the port, I finished it off.
Sep 12 16:26:41 <lufimtse>	It was the first SWT thing I worked on.
Sep 12 16:26:48 <ipun>	ah i see thank you
Sep 12 16:45:44 <ipun>	also lufimtse, i looked into this bug: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=197690
Sep 12 16:46:03 <ipun>	if you did a lot of work on date time, this might be easier for you to fix without disrupting too much of your logic
Sep 12 16:47:47 <ipun>	did you happen to touch anything with onNumberKeyInput()?
Sep 13 10:08:39 <ericwill>	morning gentlemen
Sep 13 10:11:29 <ipun>	morning gentlemen
Sep 13 10:13:40 <lufimtse>	It would be a while before I would get to it. I first have to resolve some DnD issues, then the webkit thing, then the wayland port etc.. 
Sep 13 10:14:06 <lufimtse>	if you want to work on something else, feel free to assign it to platform-swt-inbox and someday I might get to it.
Sep 13 10:14:49 <ericwill>	what's this?
Sep 13 10:15:37 <ipun>	wrong convo?
Sep 13 10:16:30 <ericwill>	lufimtse ?

Sep 13 10:32:43 <ericwill>	ipun okay
Sep 13 10:32:55 <ericwill>	ipun can you also write a JUnit test case for this bug?
Sep 13 10:33:22 <ipun>	okay
Sep 13 10:33:49 <ericwill>	you can put it in a separate gerrit
Sep 13 10:33:58 <ipun>	kk, part of same bug ID?
Sep 13 10:35:18 <ericwill>	yup
Sep 13 11:33:05 <ericwill>	ipun I'll review your patches sometime this week
Sep 13 11:33:11 <ericwill>	we can't merge anything till M2 is released
Sep 13 11:33:30 <ericwill>	aka Friday
Sep 13 11:53:16 <ipun>	kewl
Sep 13 11:53:29 <ipun>	ericwill im going to work on a bit of dark theme bugs in the time being
Sep 13 11:55:42 <ericwill>	ipun yeah that sounds fine :)
Sep 13 15:24:14 <ipun>	lufimtse, for one of my bugs im working on, it turns out that setBackground() is taking priority over css
Sep 13 15:24:21 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 13 15:24:30 <lufimtse>	which bugz
Sep 13 15:24:37 <lufimtse>	I'm working on Color of javadoc hover
Sep 13 15:24:44 <ipun>	it seems that after "refreshing" it (clicking a different tab, selecting it and dselcting it, etc) it fixes it
Sep 13 15:24:55 <ipun>	is there a method in control that refreshes?
Sep 13 15:25:31 <lufimtse>	meh?
Sep 13 15:25:38 <lufimtse>	What bugs u working on
Sep 13 15:26:15 <ipun>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=483789
Sep 13 15:26:50 <ipun>	like, for example, if you click on something it highlights it, meaning it overrites the color with a "highlight color"
Sep 13 15:27:02 <ipun>	once you remove the highlight (deselect), it refreshes it
Sep 13 15:27:05 <ipun>	thast just one example
Sep 13 15:28:35 <lufimtse>	Do you get that behavoiur in pure swt?
Sep 13 15:28:42 <lufimtse>	it's possible that platform UI messes with colours
Sep 13 15:29:23 <ipun>	i havent played with that in SWT no
Sep 13 15:37:18 <ipun>	actaully i think i know the issue. It seems that its directly overriting the css since it uses setBackgroundColor
Sep 13 15:37:37 <ipun>	i wonder if theres a way to see if it is using a theme
Sep 13 15:38:18 <ipun>	ill ask
Sep 14 10:26:49 <ipun>	hey lufimtse, i had to do some cleaning on my workspace, and i forgot where in the run configuations do i set it so it runs my code for platform.ui
Sep 14 10:26:58 <ipun>	that is if i was running a child elcipse

Sep 16 11:12:48 <ericwill>	hello fellow SWT comrades
Sep 16 11:31:10 <ipun>	hey
Sep 16 11:31:49 <ipun>	ericwill for isDisposed(), its annoying cause I cant reproduce it im not quite sure where its hitting this problem 
Sep 16 11:32:31 <ipun>	its defs going to be a item.isDisposed() condition, im just not exactly sure what exactly it should return if it is disposed
Sep 16 11:34:01 <ericwill>	ipun probably throw the error that the javadocs says
Sep 16 11:34:16 <ericwill>	or return the topItem at index 0
Sep 16 11:34:29 <ericwill>	you'll have to investigate and see
Sep 16 11:34:42 <ericwill>	btw I posted comments on that focus bug, other than those comments it's good to go

Sep 19 14:03:36 <ipun>	lufimtse, did you do any work on a method called onNumberKeyInput() in DateTime?
Sep 19 14:03:49 <lufimtse>	dunnow
Sep 19 14:03:54 <lufimtse>	does git blame says so?
Sep 19 14:04:05 <lufimtse>	looks vaguley familiar
Sep 19 14:04:54 <ipun>	yeah it does, but its pretty nested so im not sure if you were the original writer of that method or if you did the refactoring
Sep 19 15:33:44 Python interface unloaded

Sep 20 10:30:49 <ipun>	lufimtse when you have time could you check if you may or may not have written that?
Sep 20 10:30:59 <ipun>	if not, I may have to do some severe refactoring to fix it
Sep 20 10:37:02 <lufimtse>	ipun, the DateTime thing?
Sep 20 10:37:11 <ipun>	yup
Sep 20 10:43:17 <ericwill>	hello hello
Sep 20 11:10:50 <ericwill>	lufimtse hey, can you do a pull on SWT master and see if your build.sh script works?
Sep 20 11:15:00 <ericwill>	for some reason it gives me "cd: /home/ericwill/git/eclipse.platform.swt/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/bin/library"
Sep 20 11:35:40 <ericwill>	ah nvm I figured it out
Sep 20 11:35:47 <ericwill>	you have to remove a missing entry from the SWT build path
Sep 20 11:35:57 <ericwill>	one of Alex's fixes removed something
Sep 20 11:36:03 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun ^
Sep 20 11:36:29 <ipun>	thanks bro
Sep 20 12:33:51 <ipun>	so
Sep 20 12:33:53 <ipun>	lufimtse...
Sep 20 14:48:41 <ericwill>	lufimtse I wrote a python script that parses os_custom.h, fetches the list of deprecated functions in GTK, and compares to see if any dynamic functions are deprecated
Sep 20 14:48:52 <ericwill>	...there are quite a few it seems
Sep 20 14:49:13 <ericwill>	and we never see that they're deprecated since they never run through the compiler
Sep 20 14:55:52 <ipun>	 thanks ericwill
