Jul 27 11:58:48 *	Now talking on #swt
Jul 27 14:07:50 <ipun>	this may seem dumb, but is it correct to why my controlexample is running off of control.class now instead of .java?
Jul 27 14:08:40 <ipun>	my controlexample use to use the fontsize stuff that ive worked on, now its using control.class instead which i didnt touch
Jul 27 14:08:57 <ericwill>	the .class files are generated based on your changes from .java
Jul 27 14:09:11 <ericwill>	so unless you're changes aren't being reflected in the .class files you should be fine
Jul 27 14:09:19 <ericwill>	*your
Jul 27 14:13:57 <ipun>	hmm ok i might have to rebuild then thats probably the issue
Jul 27 14:14:52 <ericwill>	check the Java build path of your controlexample
Jul 27 14:15:01 <ericwill>	is the SWT project on the build path?
Jul 27 14:17:37 <ipun>	wierd enough i dont htink it is anymore...
Jul 27 15:03:46 <ipun>	ericwill looking at the commit, i copied over what its doing and its implementing it correctly with the font sizing
Jul 27 15:03:52 <ipun>	yet override_font() is still bugged
Jul 27 15:04:00 <ipun>	praying GTK looks at this seriously
Jul 27 15:04:11 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 27 15:04:17 <ericwill>	link to the commit?
Jul 27 15:07:49 <ipun>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=99c2423043f0c95a60093c618e00823e42e0ddfa
Jul 27 15:08:08 <ipun>	i implemented it the same way (to follow their way of doing it)
Jul 27 15:08:26 <ipun>	but i just realized this doesnt really have to do with override_font()
Jul 27 15:08:56 <ipun>	the guy just posted it since its just about how CSS is currently updated, but the override_font() i dont think has to do with this commit
Jul 27 15:08:59 <ericwill>	yeah so all that commit does is implement our thing
Jul 27 15:09:05 <ericwill>	i.e. convert from a pango unit to CSS
Jul 27 15:09:14 <ericwill>	which we already implemented :P
Jul 27 15:09:21 <ipun>	yup.
Jul 27 15:09:23 <ericwill>	would have been nice to know this earlier but oh well
Jul 27 15:09:47 <ipun>	sadly, i dont think we can use our code in the end =( since we're probably gonna have to use override_font() if its fixed
Jul 28 09:48:35 <ipun>	ericwill so far the comments on the GTK bug are not useful lol
Jul 28 09:48:49 <ericwill>	ipun yeah I just saw
Jul 28 09:48:59 <ipun>	not sure if Matt understands
Jul 28 09:49:18 <ericwill>	did Alex send you his Menu stuff?
Jul 28 09:50:30 <ipun>	no lemme msg him about that
Jul 28 09:52:52 <ericwill>	kk
Jul 28 10:09:11 <ipun>	should i move on to something else while i wait on GTK and alex?
Jul 28 10:09:25 <ipun>	cept my stack of things im dealing with is getting larger
Jul 28 10:13:18 <ericwill>	ipun I am going to ping them about the font thing
Jul 28 10:13:23 <ericwill>	since the comment wasn't really useful at all
Jul 28 10:14:40 <ipun>	yeah...
Jul 28 10:19:19 <ipun>	ericwill for the measured event loop bug, is this something that might be causing the signal call?
Jul 28 10:19:21 <ipun>	(GtkCellAllocCallback)get_cell_allocation
Jul 28 10:19:33 <ipun>	i forgot if we talked about that 
Jul 28 10:19:41 <ericwill>	ipun no, didn't see that
Jul 28 10:19:43 <ericwill>	looks likely
Jul 28 10:21:20 <ipun>	hmm okay. I looked deeper into that method but it doesnt have any explicit signals
Jul 28 10:21:47 <ericwill>	look in Display.initCallbacks() and see if there are any allocate callbacks
Jul 28 10:21:56 <ericwill>	also look in Tree and see there are any allocate callback methods
Jul 28 10:22:40 <ipun>	kk
Jul 28 10:32:42 <ericwill>	ipun send me the commit for that get_dpi thing
Jul 28 10:32:44 <ericwill>	from matt watson
Jul 28 10:33:04 <ipun>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=df08fc91bdc1d2e4c866122304fabe4dd298a7de
Jul 28 10:33:28 <ipun>	basically we need their override_font() to use that calculation
Jul 28 10:33:38 <ipun>	if we do that, it will fix it
Jul 28 10:33:49 <ericwill>	okay I think we are making progress
Jul 28 11:58:36 <ipun>	dispaly.initCallback has some callbacks like size_allocate
Jul 28 11:58:55 <ipun>	thats the only one though
Jul 28 12:02:05 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 28 12:04:23 <ipun>	ericwill: patch went out okay?
Jul 28 12:04:27 <ipun>	ill comment on the bug then
Jul 28 12:04:43 <ericwill>	ipun just commented lol, no need
Jul 28 12:04:46 <ipun>	okay
Jul 28 12:04:50 <ericwill>	we have a patch but I'm just waiting for him to commit it
Jul 28 12:05:37 <ipun>	how about on bugzilla?
Jul 28 12:08:39 <ericwill>	wait for the GTK bug to get fixed and then we can mark the Eclipse bug as fixed and link the commit
Jul 28 12:10:37 <ipun>	kk
Jul 28 13:57:25 <ericwill>	so that font bug is fixed and merged in GTK now
Jul 28 13:57:26 <ericwill>	all good
Jul 28 14:39:07 <ericwill>	ipun if you are ever bored/want something you don't have to think a lot about, make a bugzilla filter for all open SWT bugs and go through them
Jul 28 14:39:17 <ericwill>	close the ones which aren't relevant/can't reproduce
Jul 28 14:39:21 <ericwill>	to keep the BZ tidy
Jul 28 14:39:26 <ipun>	oaky
Jul 28 14:39:30 <ipun>	okay*
Jul 28 14:48:21 <ipun>	ericwill doesnt look like nulling the proc actually turns it off
Jul 28 14:57:22 <ericwill>	ipun hmm
Jul 28 14:57:30 <ericwill>	is there a method somewhere that destroys them or something?
Jul 28 15:05:01 <ipun>	ericwill theres a method called setEnabled from callback class, but i tried it and it doesnt seem to work
Jul 28 15:05:17 <ipun>	... wat
Jul 28 15:05:19 <ipun>	wait*
Jul 28 15:06:21 <ipun>	hahahaahah
Jul 28 15:06:26 <ipun>	it works
Jul 28 15:06:30 <ericwill>	okay :P
Jul 28 15:06:47 <ipun>	i just had to move the reenabling of it lower
Jul 28 15:06:53 <ipun>	lemme test around with it and we're good
Jul 28 15:57:16 <ipun>	hey lufimtse im still having issues compiling gtk for some reason with jhbuild... besides cancelling it and rebuilding again, did you find any other solution>
Jul 28 15:57:34 <lufimtse>	hey
Jul 28 16:18:48 <lufimtse>	ipun, what was the exact command we used again?
Jul 28 16:19:01 <lufimtse>	jhbuild buildone --force gtk+ ?
Jul 28 16:22:01 <ipun>	yeah thats it
Jul 28 16:25:09 <ericwill>	ipun please post on the platform-ui-dev mailing list and ask someone to review this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77096/
Jul 28 16:25:33 <ericwill>	ipun also take a look at this guy: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=493357
Jul 28 16:27:31 <ericwill>	I started work on that but I won't be able to finish it in time before I leave
Jul 28 16:27:55 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill I've updated the wiki: https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT/Devel/Gtk/jhbuild#Building_different_versions_of_gtk_.28or_compiling_your_changes.29
Jul 28 16:28:10 <lufimtse>	What you want is: 
Jul 28 16:28:10 <lufimtse>	 jhbuild buildone --force --no-network --distclean gtk+
Jul 28 16:28:25 <lufimtse>	the --distclean is especially needed if you go back to an older gtk version. 
Jul 28 16:28:45 <ipun>	it looks like someone broke a junit case in master
Jul 28 16:29:01 <lufimtse>	ipun, which one?
Jul 28 16:29:09 <ipun>	test_getPrinterList
Jul 28 16:29:20 <ipun>	unless its local
Jul 28 16:29:42 <lufimtse>	doesn't work on my system if I have a printer
Jul 28 16:29:53 <lufimtse>	stopped working somewhere in Gtk3.18
Jul 28 16:30:03 <ipun>	oh i see
Jul 28 16:30:04 <lufimtse>	I've been meaning to file a bug for it
Jul 28 16:30:11 <lufimtse>	maybe something for you to work on. 
Jul 28 16:30:13 <ipun>	ill ignore it for now
Jul 28 16:30:21 <lufimtse>	do you have a printer on your system?
Jul 28 16:30:34 <ipun>	ya
Jul 28 16:30:41 <ipun>	i just added it like a week ago though
Jul 28 16:33:45 <lufimtse>	that's probably why the jUnit fails
Jul 28 16:33:52 <lufimtse>	if you have time, feel free to investigate sometime
Jul 28 16:33:59 <lufimtse>	would be useful to have it fixed.
Jul 28 16:34:10 <lufimtse>	afaik it doesn't reproduce with gtk3.16 and before
Jul 28 16:34:13 <lufimtse>	so might be gtk bug.

Jul 29 11:38:32 <ipun>	lufimtse looks like the printerlist bug in our test case is really broken logic, techincally none of it shouldve passed
Jul 29 11:39:05 <lufimtse>	lol
Jul 29 15:28:33 <ipun>	ericwill should I be replacing all the gtk calls to that function to my private one? Im not sure if this is what we should do
Jul 29 15:28:58 <ericwill>	your private method is just a wrapper
Jul 29 15:29:01 <ericwill>	for the GTK call
Jul 29 15:29:07 <ericwill>	with the callback.setEnabled() in it
Jul 29 15:32:04 <ipun>	yeah i know, im just curious if its necessary to do that for every call that uses that function
Jul 29 15:32:19 <ericwill>	we should
Jul 29 15:32:39 <ericwill>	because if someone wants to use one of those methods in a measure event, the same bug will come up
Jul 29 15:33:48 <ipun>	oaky sounds good
Jul 29 15:34:18 <ipun>	i might have to implement it in Control and Widget as well, since Tree is a subclass of Control but Treeitem is a widget subclass
Jul 29 15:35:39 <ericwill>	ipun nah just do it in Control then
Jul 29 15:35:45 <ericwill>	sorry, widget
Jul 29 15:35:50 <ericwill>	all Controls are widgets
Jul 29 15:38:16 <ipun>	ah your right sorry i misread it 
Jul 29 16:29:25 <ipun>	ericwill how do you generate a new changeset number again? I tried pushing my changes but the changeset was closed already.
Jul 29 16:29:41 <ericwill>	before amending the commit, click the gerrit button in egit
Jul 29 16:29:50 <ericwill>	should give you something with multiple zeros
Jul 29 16:29:57 <ericwill>	copy and paste that and use it for your new change
Jul 29 16:32:15 <ipun>	nice thanks!

Aug 03 16:34:42 <ericwill>	check preferences
Aug 04 11:01:26 <ipun>	ericwill: for the setVisible bug you assigned me, seems like a GTK error. Documentation of gtk_window_get_position() says its really unaccurate and that its not 100% reliable
Aug 04 11:01:53 <ericwill>	ipun then close it as such with a link to the documentation

Aug 11 17:07:49 <ipun>	kk
Aug 12 09:14:43 <ericwill>	lufimtse hey...when you're around I have a question
Aug 12 09:58:47 <lufimtse>	ericwill, hullo
Aug 12 09:59:13 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I miss your company already X-D
Aug 12 09:59:24 <lufimtse>	wanted to complain about my landlady to you.
Aug 12 09:59:42 <ericwill>	haha yeah, working from home is kinda lonely
Aug 12 09:59:44 <ericwill>	the sleep is nice though
Aug 12 09:59:52 <ericwill>	what did your landlady do?
Aug 12 10:00:02 <lufimtse>	It's like when I was suggesting to you to use certain tools (emacs), she is suggesting me to organise my room in a certain way. Man she's driving me mad ^____^.
Aug 12 10:00:14 <lufimtse>	Boy I have learned
Aug 12 10:00:47 <ericwill>	lol, that seems like an odd thing for a landlady to be involved in -.-
Aug 12 10:04:19 <ericwill>	btw lufimtse I tested your sysdeps script...works very well
Aug 12 10:04:55 <ericwill>	might be useful to note that after using sysdeps, you can only use the build.sh once you've renamed your .classpath_gtk in the SWT git repo
Aug 12 10:05:39 <lufimtse>	I was thinking of fixing that up... hmmm
Aug 12 10:05:52 <lufimtse>	I could add a check?
Aug 12 10:06:35 <lufimtse>	like ask user "no .classpath found, would you like to copy .classpath_gtk to .classpath? [y/n]"
Aug 12 10:06:37 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Aug 12 10:08:06 <xipun>	wait lufimtse why is your landlady giving you pointers about your room
Aug 12 10:09:20 <lufimtse>	Some of the furniture is hers
Aug 12 10:09:41 <lufimtse>	We have a friendly relationship, but her micro-management is somewhat intense..
Aug 12 10:09:52 <lufimtse>	also I'm not that clean, she is a obsessive about cleaning
Aug 12 10:10:04 <lufimtse>	I have stuff lying around my room, kinda like on my desk.
Aug 12 10:10:18 <lufimtse>	she's like, "you should put the things you don't use into the garage"
Aug 12 10:10:25 <lufimtse>	me like "i'm quite happy with my room the way it is"
Aug 12 10:10:49 <lufimtse>	tensions eventually escalate, 
Aug 12 10:11:08 <lufimtse>	grr
Aug 12 10:11:14 <lufimtse>	need to let off some steam lol ^_^
Aug 12 10:11:32 <ericwill>	oh lols
Aug 12 10:11:38 <ericwill>	yeah that would be annoying
Aug 12 10:12:48 <ericwill>	lufimtse re: the sysdeps thing, you could check and print something, but offering to copy it makes the assumption that you've checked out the git repo already
Aug 12 10:12:55 <ericwill>	which is fine by me actually
Aug 12 10:13:41 <lufimtse>	good idea. 
Aug 12 10:13:56 <lufimtse>	very unintrusive
Aug 12 10:14:58 <ericwill>	I like the script, saved me a lot of time
Aug 12 10:17:08 <ericwill>	also lufimtse, did you by any chance document that bit about the "fetch from gerrit" menu missing? I ran into the same issue on my machine at home, can't remember how you got it to work
Aug 12 10:43:56 <lufimtse>	humms
Aug 12 10:44:39 <lufimtse>	not in public wiki, but let me check my private wiki

Aug 12 10:55:01 <ericwill>	lufimtse okay will try it out, thanks
Aug 12 11:04:22 <ericwill>	lufimtse hmm so all I needed to do was select the http option with no username
Aug 12 11:04:27 <ericwill>	i.e.: http://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git
Aug 12 11:04:39 <lufimtse>	let me check
Aug 12 11:05:01 <lufimtse>	ssh://lufimtsev@git.eclipse.org:29418/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git
Aug 12 11:05:06 <lufimtse>	avoid the 'gitroot' one
Aug 12 11:05:24 <lufimtse>	I also copied SSH keys to the right places
Aug 12 11:05:42 <lufimtse>	I keep my SSH key in my google drive and then copy it to my machine when needed
Aug 12 11:05:50 <lufimtse>	or generate new key and put to eclipse org
Aug 12 11:06:06 <ericwill>	ah okay
Aug 12 11:06:32 <lufimtse>	http://storage8.static.itmages.com/i/16/0812/h_1471014423_5798266_dffa5947e3.png
Aug 12 11:06:34 <lufimtse>	when I push
Aug 12 11:06:45 <lufimtse>	for review
Aug 12 11:07:01 <lufimtse>	you may have to tinker with .git/config
Aug 12 11:07:05 <lufimtse>	and stuff gerrit in there
Aug 12 11:07:13 <lufimtse>	do you need my copy of the .git/config?
Aug 12 11:07:25 <ericwill>	no no
Aug 12 11:07:31 <ericwill>	I copied the one from my work machine, seems to work
Aug 12 11:08:10 <ericwill>	also the ssh works for me now too, just had to remove gitroot from the URI
Aug 12 11:08:12 <ericwill>	all good
Aug 12 11:22:19 <lufimtse>	kewl
Aug 12 11:22:34 <lufimtse>	I should document it
Aug 12 11:22:48 <lufimtse>	originally you helped me with finding that one had to get rid of 'gitroot',
Aug 12 11:23:49 <ericwill>	yup
Aug 12 11:23:56 <ericwill>	and now I had totally forgotten it
Aug 12 11:24:04 <ericwill>	this is why it's important to document :P
Aug 12 11:38:45 <ericwill>	ipun is this for review? https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78969/
Aug 12 11:39:18 <ipun>	oh woops sorry i forgot to tag the WIP on it
Aug 12 11:39:23 <ipun>	im just running the tests on it now
Aug 12 11:39:26 <ericwill>	kk
Aug 12 11:40:16 <lufimtse>	After I push stage 1 of the webkit business, I'll tryina invest sometime into more documentation and blogging
Aug 12 11:40:36 <lufimtse>	I've been somewhat happy with my zim and been lazy about putting things into public wiki
Aug 12 11:40:47 <lufimtse>	:-3
Aug 12 11:40:54 <lufimtse>	I'm so bad.
Aug 12 11:42:51 <ipun>	lufimtse im having issues compiling eclipse after running your build script =(
Aug 12 11:43:04 <lufimtse>	X-D
Aug 12 11:43:08 <lufimtse>	let's investigate
Aug 12 11:43:59 <ericwill>	ipun are you by any chance getting: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.OS.setenv([B[BI)I
Aug 12 11:48:41 <ericwill>	lufimtse it looks like your commit yesterday to the build script broke something
Aug 12 11:48:46 <ericwill>	reverting it fixes it for me
Aug 12 11:58:47 <lufimtse>	it's the commit after my commit
Aug 12 11:58:51 <lufimtse>	sravan's changes to c.c
Aug 12 11:58:55 <lufimtse>	ericwill, 
Aug 12 11:58:59 <lufimtse>	Investigating
Aug 12 11:59:11 <lufimtse>	BUT FIRST
Aug 12 11:59:12 <ericwill>	hmm
Aug 12 11:59:13 <lufimtse>	Tea.
Aug 12 11:59:50 <ericwill>	okay makes sense actually
Aug 12 12:03:35 <lufimtse>	of course,
Aug 12 12:03:45 <lufimtse>	drinking tea before tacking a problem always makes sense.
Aug 12 12:04:31 <ericwill>	:D
Aug 12 12:07:41 <ipun>	well my patch works if rebased on a previous commit
Aug 12 12:07:48 <ipun>	tried on all versions, it looks good now
Aug 12 12:08:32 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill I'm investigating the setenv business, will post in bug or on dev-list
Aug 12 12:08:46 <ericwill>	kk
Aug 12 12:51:11 <lufimtse>	ericwill|lunch, ipun I figured it out. the first static initializer in OS.java calls OS.setenv(..) before the library is loaded.
Aug 12 13:25:54 <ericwill>	oh lord
Aug 12 13:25:58 <ericwill>	rebooted over lunch
Aug 12 13:26:05 <ericwill>	forgot I had removed my boot partition

Aug 12 15:03:32 <lufimtse>	sec
Aug 12 15:03:39 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I'm still adding the .class thing check
Aug 12 15:03:43 <lufimtse>	I wrote it, just need to push it.
Aug 12 15:03:56 <lufimtse>	twiddling with hi-dpi unsat.link error.
Aug 12 15:03:59 <lufimtse>	atm
Aug 12 15:04:06 <ericwill>	yeah that error is annoying
Aug 12 15:04:11 <ericwill>	I just reverted it locally
Aug 12 15:34:02 <lufimtse>	ericwill, ipun, I submitted a patch, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78989/
Aug 12 15:34:15 <lufimtse>	I'm awaiting Niraj or Sravan to review and push to master.
Aug 12 15:34:45 <ericwill>	lufimtse saw it, looks good from my end
Aug 12 15:34:52 <ericwill>	sadly they are in India and probably in bed already
Aug 12 15:34:56 <ericwill>	so we don't get a fix till Monday
Aug 12 15:35:00 <lufimtse>	If they haven't done it by monday evening, I'll just push it myself...
