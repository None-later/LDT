Jul 27 11:58:48 *	Now talking on #swt
Jul 27 14:07:50 <ipun>	this may seem dumb, but is it correct to why my controlexample is running off of control.class now instead of .java?
Jul 27 14:08:40 <ipun>	my controlexample use to use the fontsize stuff that ive worked on, now its using control.class instead which i didnt touch
Jul 27 14:08:57 <ericwill>	the .class files are generated based on your changes from .java
Jul 27 14:09:11 <ericwill>	so unless you're changes aren't being reflected in the .class files you should be fine
Jul 27 14:09:19 <ericwill>	*your
Jul 27 14:13:57 <ipun>	hmm ok i might have to rebuild then thats probably the issue
Jul 27 14:14:52 <ericwill>	check the Java build path of your controlexample
Jul 27 14:15:01 <ericwill>	is the SWT project on the build path?
Jul 27 14:17:37 <ipun>	wierd enough i dont htink it is anymore...
Jul 27 15:03:46 <ipun>	ericwill looking at the commit, i copied over what its doing and its implementing it correctly with the font sizing
Jul 27 15:03:52 <ipun>	yet override_font() is still bugged
Jul 27 15:04:00 <ipun>	praying GTK looks at this seriously
Jul 27 15:04:11 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 27 15:04:17 <ericwill>	link to the commit?
Jul 27 15:07:49 <ipun>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=99c2423043f0c95a60093c618e00823e42e0ddfa
Jul 27 15:08:08 <ipun>	i implemented it the same way (to follow their way of doing it)
Jul 27 15:08:26 <ipun>	but i just realized this doesnt really have to do with override_font()
Jul 27 15:08:56 <ipun>	the guy just posted it since its just about how CSS is currently updated, but the override_font() i dont think has to do with this commit
Jul 27 15:08:59 <ericwill>	yeah so all that commit does is implement our thing
Jul 27 15:09:05 <ericwill>	i.e. convert from a pango unit to CSS
Jul 27 15:09:14 <ericwill>	which we already implemented :P
Jul 27 15:09:21 <ipun>	yup.
Jul 27 15:09:23 <ericwill>	would have been nice to know this earlier but oh well
Jul 27 15:09:47 <ipun>	sadly, i dont think we can use our code in the end =( since we're probably gonna have to use override_font() if its fixed
Jul 28 09:48:35 <ipun>	ericwill so far the comments on the GTK bug are not useful lol
Jul 28 09:48:49 <ericwill>	ipun yeah I just saw
Jul 28 09:48:59 <ipun>	not sure if Matt understands
Jul 28 09:49:18 <ericwill>	did Alex send you his Menu stuff?
Jul 28 09:50:30 <ipun>	no lemme msg him about that
Jul 28 09:52:52 <ericwill>	kk
Jul 28 10:09:11 <ipun>	should i move on to something else while i wait on GTK and alex?
Jul 28 10:09:25 <ipun>	cept my stack of things im dealing with is getting larger
Jul 28 10:13:18 <ericwill>	ipun I am going to ping them about the font thing
Jul 28 10:13:23 <ericwill>	since the comment wasn't really useful at all
Jul 28 10:14:40 <ipun>	yeah...
Jul 28 10:19:19 <ipun>	ericwill for the measured event loop bug, is this something that might be causing the signal call?
Jul 28 10:19:21 <ipun>	(GtkCellAllocCallback)get_cell_allocation
Jul 28 10:19:33 <ipun>	i forgot if we talked about that 
Jul 28 10:19:41 <ericwill>	ipun no, didn't see that
Jul 28 10:19:43 <ericwill>	looks likely
Jul 28 10:21:20 <ipun>	hmm okay. I looked deeper into that method but it doesnt have any explicit signals
Jul 28 10:21:47 <ericwill>	look in Display.initCallbacks() and see if there are any allocate callbacks
Jul 28 10:21:56 <ericwill>	also look in Tree and see there are any allocate callback methods
Jul 28 10:22:40 <ipun>	kk
Jul 28 10:32:42 <ericwill>	ipun send me the commit for that get_dpi thing
Jul 28 10:32:44 <ericwill>	from matt watson
Jul 28 10:33:04 <ipun>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=df08fc91bdc1d2e4c866122304fabe4dd298a7de
Jul 28 10:33:28 <ipun>	basically we need their override_font() to use that calculation
Jul 28 10:33:38 <ipun>	if we do that, it will fix it
Jul 28 10:33:49 <ericwill>	okay I think we are making progress
Jul 28 11:58:36 <ipun>	dispaly.initCallback has some callbacks like size_allocate
Jul 28 11:58:55 <ipun>	thats the only one though
Jul 28 12:02:05 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 28 12:04:23 <ipun>	ericwill: patch went out okay?
Jul 28 12:04:27 <ipun>	ill comment on the bug then
Jul 28 12:04:43 <ericwill>	ipun just commented lol, no need
Jul 28 12:04:46 <ipun>	okay
Jul 28 12:04:50 <ericwill>	we have a patch but I'm just waiting for him to commit it
Jul 28 12:05:37 <ipun>	how about on bugzilla?
Jul 28 12:08:39 <ericwill>	wait for the GTK bug to get fixed and then we can mark the Eclipse bug as fixed and link the commit
Jul 28 12:10:37 <ipun>	kk
Jul 28 13:57:25 <ericwill>	so that font bug is fixed and merged in GTK now
Jul 28 13:57:26 <ericwill>	all good
Jul 28 14:39:07 <ericwill>	ipun if you are ever bored/want something you don't have to think a lot about, make a bugzilla filter for all open SWT bugs and go through them
Jul 28 14:39:17 <ericwill>	close the ones which aren't relevant/can't reproduce
Jul 28 14:39:21 <ericwill>	to keep the BZ tidy
Jul 28 14:39:26 <ipun>	oaky
Jul 28 14:39:30 <ipun>	okay*
Jul 28 14:48:21 <ipun>	ericwill doesnt look like nulling the proc actually turns it off
Jul 28 14:57:22 <ericwill>	ipun hmm
Jul 28 14:57:30 <ericwill>	is there a method somewhere that destroys them or something?
Jul 28 15:05:01 <ipun>	ericwill theres a method called setEnabled from callback class, but i tried it and it doesnt seem to work
Jul 28 15:05:17 <ipun>	... wat
Jul 28 15:05:19 <ipun>	wait*
Jul 28 15:06:21 <ipun>	hahahaahah
Jul 28 15:06:26 <ipun>	it works
Jul 28 15:06:30 <ericwill>	okay :P
Jul 28 15:06:47 <ipun>	i just had to move the reenabling of it lower
Jul 28 15:06:53 <ipun>	lemme test around with it and we're good
Jul 28 15:57:16 <ipun>	hey lufimtse im still having issues compiling gtk for some reason with jhbuild... besides cancelling it and rebuilding again, did you find any other solution>
Jul 28 15:57:34 <lufimtse>	hey
Jul 28 16:18:48 <lufimtse>	ipun, what was the exact command we used again?
Jul 28 16:19:01 <lufimtse>	jhbuild buildone --force gtk+ ?
Jul 28 16:22:01 <ipun>	yeah thats it
Jul 28 16:25:09 <ericwill>	ipun please post on the platform-ui-dev mailing list and ask someone to review this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77096/
Jul 28 16:25:33 <ericwill>	ipun also take a look at this guy: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=493357
Jul 28 16:27:31 <ericwill>	I started work on that but I won't be able to finish it in time before I leave
Jul 28 16:27:55 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill I've updated the wiki: https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT/Devel/Gtk/jhbuild#Building_different_versions_of_gtk_.28or_compiling_your_changes.29
Jul 28 16:28:10 <lufimtse>	What you want is: 
Jul 28 16:28:10 <lufimtse>	 jhbuild buildone --force --no-network --distclean gtk+
Jul 28 16:28:25 <lufimtse>	the --distclean is especially needed if you go back to an older gtk version. 
Jul 28 16:28:45 <ipun>	it looks like someone broke a junit case in master
Jul 28 16:29:01 <lufimtse>	ipun, which one?
Jul 28 16:29:09 <ipun>	test_getPrinterList
Jul 28 16:29:20 <ipun>	unless its local
Jul 28 16:29:42 <lufimtse>	doesn't work on my system if I have a printer
Jul 28 16:29:53 <lufimtse>	stopped working somewhere in Gtk3.18
Jul 28 16:30:03 <ipun>	oh i see
Jul 28 16:30:04 <lufimtse>	I've been meaning to file a bug for it
Jul 28 16:30:11 <lufimtse>	maybe something for you to work on. 
Jul 28 16:30:13 <ipun>	ill ignore it for now
Jul 28 16:30:21 <lufimtse>	do you have a printer on your system?
Jul 28 16:30:34 <ipun>	ya
Jul 28 16:30:41 <ipun>	i just added it like a week ago though
Jul 28 16:33:45 <lufimtse>	that's probably why the jUnit fails
Jul 28 16:33:52 <lufimtse>	if you have time, feel free to investigate sometime
Jul 28 16:33:59 <lufimtse>	would be useful to have it fixed.
Jul 28 16:34:10 <lufimtse>	afaik it doesn't reproduce with gtk3.16 and before
Jul 28 16:34:13 <lufimtse>	so might be gtk bug.

Jul 29 11:38:32 <ipun>	lufimtse looks like the printerlist bug in our test case is really broken logic, techincally none of it shouldve passed
Jul 29 11:39:05 <lufimtse>	lol
Jul 29 15:28:33 <ipun>	ericwill should I be replacing all the gtk calls to that function to my private one? Im not sure if this is what we should do
Jul 29 15:28:58 <ericwill>	your private method is just a wrapper
Jul 29 15:29:01 <ericwill>	for the GTK call
Jul 29 15:29:07 <ericwill>	with the callback.setEnabled() in it
Jul 29 15:32:04 <ipun>	yeah i know, im just curious if its necessary to do that for every call that uses that function
Jul 29 15:32:19 <ericwill>	we should
Jul 29 15:32:39 <ericwill>	because if someone wants to use one of those methods in a measure event, the same bug will come up
Jul 29 15:33:48 <ipun>	oaky sounds good
Jul 29 15:34:18 <ipun>	i might have to implement it in Control and Widget as well, since Tree is a subclass of Control but Treeitem is a widget subclass
Jul 29 15:35:39 <ericwill>	ipun nah just do it in Control then
Jul 29 15:35:45 <ericwill>	sorry, widget
Jul 29 15:35:50 <ericwill>	all Controls are widgets
Jul 29 15:38:16 <ipun>	ah your right sorry i misread it 
Jul 29 16:29:25 <ipun>	ericwill how do you generate a new changeset number again? I tried pushing my changes but the changeset was closed already.
Jul 29 16:29:41 <ericwill>	before amending the commit, click the gerrit button in egit
Jul 29 16:29:50 <ericwill>	should give you something with multiple zeros
Jul 29 16:29:57 <ericwill>	copy and paste that and use it for your new change
Jul 29 16:32:15 <ipun>	nice thanks!

Aug 03 16:34:42 <ericwill>	check preferences
Aug 04 11:01:26 <ipun>	ericwill: for the setVisible bug you assigned me, seems like a GTK error. Documentation of gtk_window_get_position() says its really unaccurate and that its not 100% reliable
Aug 04 11:01:53 <ericwill>	ipun then close it as such with a link to the documentation

Aug 11 17:07:49 <ipun>	kk
Aug 12 09:14:43 <ericwill>	lufimtse hey...when you're around I have a question
Aug 12 09:58:47 <lufimtse>	ericwill, hullo
Aug 12 09:59:13 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I miss your company already X-D
Aug 12 09:59:24 <lufimtse>	wanted to complain about my landlady to you.
Aug 12 09:59:42 <ericwill>	haha yeah, working from home is kinda lonely
Aug 12 09:59:44 <ericwill>	the sleep is nice though
Aug 12 09:59:52 <ericwill>	what did your landlady do?
Aug 12 10:00:02 <lufimtse>	It's like when I was suggesting to you to use certain tools (emacs), she is suggesting me to organise my room in a certain way. Man she's driving me mad ^____^.
Aug 12 10:00:14 <lufimtse>	Boy I have learned
Aug 12 10:00:47 <ericwill>	lol, that seems like an odd thing for a landlady to be involved in -.-
Aug 12 10:04:19 <ericwill>	btw lufimtse I tested your sysdeps script...works very well
Aug 12 10:04:55 <ericwill>	might be useful to note that after using sysdeps, you can only use the build.sh once you've renamed your .classpath_gtk in the SWT git repo
Aug 12 10:05:39 <lufimtse>	I was thinking of fixing that up... hmmm
Aug 12 10:05:52 <lufimtse>	I could add a check?
Aug 12 10:06:35 <lufimtse>	like ask user "no .classpath found, would you like to copy .classpath_gtk to .classpath? [y/n]"
Aug 12 10:06:37 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Aug 12 10:08:06 <xipun>	wait lufimtse why is your landlady giving you pointers about your room
Aug 12 10:09:20 <lufimtse>	Some of the furniture is hers
Aug 12 10:09:41 <lufimtse>	We have a friendly relationship, but her micro-management is somewhat intense..
Aug 12 10:09:52 <lufimtse>	also I'm not that clean, she is a obsessive about cleaning
Aug 12 10:10:04 <lufimtse>	I have stuff lying around my room, kinda like on my desk.
Aug 12 10:10:18 <lufimtse>	she's like, "you should put the things you don't use into the garage"
Aug 12 10:10:25 <lufimtse>	me like "i'm quite happy with my room the way it is"
Aug 12 10:10:49 <lufimtse>	tensions eventually escalate, 
Aug 12 10:11:08 <lufimtse>	grr
Aug 12 10:11:14 <lufimtse>	need to let off some steam lol ^_^
Aug 12 10:11:32 <ericwill>	oh lols
Aug 12 10:11:38 <ericwill>	yeah that would be annoying
Aug 12 10:12:48 <ericwill>	lufimtse re: the sysdeps thing, you could check and print something, but offering to copy it makes the assumption that you've checked out the git repo already
Aug 12 10:12:55 <ericwill>	which is fine by me actually
Aug 12 10:13:41 <lufimtse>	good idea. 
Aug 12 10:13:56 <lufimtse>	very unintrusive
Aug 12 10:14:58 <ericwill>	I like the script, saved me a lot of time
Aug 12 10:17:08 <ericwill>	also lufimtse, did you by any chance document that bit about the "fetch from gerrit" menu missing? I ran into the same issue on my machine at home, can't remember how you got it to work
Aug 12 10:43:56 <lufimtse>	humms
Aug 12 10:44:39 <lufimtse>	not in public wiki, but let me check my private wiki

Aug 12 10:55:01 <ericwill>	lufimtse okay will try it out, thanks
Aug 12 11:04:22 <ericwill>	lufimtse hmm so all I needed to do was select the http option with no username
Aug 12 11:04:27 <ericwill>	i.e.: http://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git
Aug 12 11:04:39 <lufimtse>	let me check
Aug 12 11:05:01 <lufimtse>	ssh://lufimtsev@git.eclipse.org:29418/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git
Aug 12 11:05:06 <lufimtse>	avoid the 'gitroot' one
Aug 12 11:05:24 <lufimtse>	I also copied SSH keys to the right places
Aug 12 11:05:42 <lufimtse>	I keep my SSH key in my google drive and then copy it to my machine when needed
Aug 12 11:05:50 <lufimtse>	or generate new key and put to eclipse org
Aug 12 11:06:06 <ericwill>	ah okay
Aug 12 11:06:32 <lufimtse>	http://storage8.static.itmages.com/i/16/0812/h_1471014423_5798266_dffa5947e3.png
Aug 12 11:06:34 <lufimtse>	when I push
Aug 12 11:06:45 <lufimtse>	for review
Aug 12 11:07:01 <lufimtse>	you may have to tinker with .git/config
Aug 12 11:07:05 <lufimtse>	and stuff gerrit in there
Aug 12 11:07:13 <lufimtse>	do you need my copy of the .git/config?
Aug 12 11:07:25 <ericwill>	no no
Aug 12 11:07:31 <ericwill>	I copied the one from my work machine, seems to work
Aug 12 11:08:10 <ericwill>	also the ssh works for me now too, just had to remove gitroot from the URI
Aug 12 11:08:12 <ericwill>	all good
Aug 12 11:22:19 <lufimtse>	kewl
Aug 12 11:22:34 <lufimtse>	I should document it
Aug 12 11:22:48 <lufimtse>	originally you helped me with finding that one had to get rid of 'gitroot',
Aug 12 11:23:49 <ericwill>	yup
Aug 12 11:23:56 <ericwill>	and now I had totally forgotten it
Aug 12 11:24:04 <ericwill>	this is why it's important to document :P
Aug 12 11:38:45 <ericwill>	ipun is this for review? https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78969/
Aug 12 11:39:18 <ipun>	oh woops sorry i forgot to tag the WIP on it
Aug 12 11:39:23 <ipun>	im just running the tests on it now
Aug 12 11:39:26 <ericwill>	kk
Aug 12 11:40:16 <lufimtse>	After I push stage 1 of the webkit business, I'll tryina invest sometime into more documentation and blogging
Aug 12 11:40:36 <lufimtse>	I've been somewhat happy with my zim and been lazy about putting things into public wiki
Aug 12 11:40:47 <lufimtse>	:-3
Aug 12 11:40:54 <lufimtse>	I'm so bad.
Aug 12 11:42:51 <ipun>	lufimtse im having issues compiling eclipse after running your build script =(
Aug 12 11:43:04 <lufimtse>	X-D
Aug 12 11:43:08 <lufimtse>	let's investigate
Aug 12 11:43:59 <ericwill>	ipun are you by any chance getting: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.OS.setenv([B[BI)I
Aug 12 11:48:41 <ericwill>	lufimtse it looks like your commit yesterday to the build script broke something
Aug 12 11:48:46 <ericwill>	reverting it fixes it for me
Aug 12 11:58:47 <lufimtse>	it's the commit after my commit
Aug 12 11:58:51 <lufimtse>	sravan's changes to c.c
Aug 12 11:58:55 <lufimtse>	ericwill, 
Aug 12 11:58:59 <lufimtse>	Investigating
Aug 12 11:59:11 <lufimtse>	BUT FIRST
Aug 12 11:59:12 <ericwill>	hmm
Aug 12 11:59:13 <lufimtse>	Tea.
Aug 12 11:59:50 <ericwill>	okay makes sense actually
Aug 12 12:03:35 <lufimtse>	of course,
Aug 12 12:03:45 <lufimtse>	drinking tea before tacking a problem always makes sense.
Aug 12 12:04:31 <ericwill>	:D
Aug 12 12:07:41 <ipun>	well my patch works if rebased on a previous commit
Aug 12 12:07:48 <ipun>	tried on all versions, it looks good now
Aug 12 12:08:32 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill I'm investigating the setenv business, will post in bug or on dev-list
Aug 12 12:08:46 <ericwill>	kk
Aug 12 12:51:11 <lufimtse>	ericwill|lunch, ipun I figured it out. the first static initializer in OS.java calls OS.setenv(..) before the library is loaded.
Aug 12 13:25:54 <ericwill>	oh lord
Aug 12 13:25:58 <ericwill>	rebooted over lunch
Aug 12 13:26:05 <ericwill>	forgot I had removed my boot partition
Aug 12 13:26:07 <ericwill>	had to re-install grub
Aug 12 13:30:57 <ipun>	did you let svan know lufimtse ?
Aug 12 13:36:57 <ipun>	:qq
Aug 12 13:37:02 <ipun>	woops sorry
Aug 12 13:44:56 <lufimtse>	ipun, I posted in the bug, investigating fix.
Aug 12 14:51:27 <ericwill>	lufimtse are you okay with me merging that sysdeps thing?
Aug 12 15:03:32 <lufimtse>	sec
Aug 12 15:03:39 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I'm still adding the .class thing check
Aug 12 15:03:43 <lufimtse>	I wrote it, just need to push it.
Aug 12 15:03:56 <lufimtse>	twiddling with hi-dpi unsat.link error.
Aug 12 15:03:59 <lufimtse>	atm
Aug 12 15:04:06 <ericwill>	yeah that error is annoying
Aug 12 15:04:11 <ericwill>	I just reverted it locally
Aug 12 15:34:02 <lufimtse>	ericwill, ipun, I submitted a patch, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78989/
Aug 12 15:34:15 <lufimtse>	I'm awaiting Niraj or Sravan to review and push to master.
Aug 12 15:34:45 <ericwill>	lufimtse saw it, looks good from my end
Aug 12 15:34:52 <ericwill>	sadly they are in India and probably in bed already
Aug 12 15:34:56 <ericwill>	so we don't get a fix till Monday
Aug 12 15:35:00 <lufimtse>	If they haven't done it by monday evening, I'll just push it myself...

Aug 17 10:34:52 <ipun>	for bug 182598, Im wondering if I should close it as unfixed or not. This has to do with how SWT is handling listeners; basically the item is destroyed before a method in the callback is ran
Aug 17 10:35:06 <ipun>	im not entirely sure how to fix this
Aug 17 10:36:50 <ericwill>	ipun the item is destroyed before the callback?
Aug 17 10:36:58 <ipun>	yeah
Aug 17 10:37:52 <ipun>	it crashes at tree.setItemCount(1)
Aug 17 10:38:08 <ipun>	its during the second event trigger 
Aug 17 10:38:46 <ericwill>	where in setItemCount does it crash?
Aug 17 10:40:26 <ipun>	i cant actually tell. It offsets the process so its done later
Aug 17 10:40:59 <ipun>	running a debug through the method is fine, but once it leaves and trys to finish the rest of the app, it crashes
Aug 17 10:41:11 <ipun>	i also noticed changed it to setItemCount(2) works fine

Aug 29 11:55:41 <lufimtse>	ok
Aug 29 11:55:44 <lufimtse>	test hard my friend.

Aug 30 14:58:25 <ipun>	lufimtse hey i think i found the commit causing it through git blame, how do i switch to that exact commit again?
Aug 30 14:58:35 <ipun>	or is there a way to search git history?

Aug 30 15:12:29 <ipun>	yeah thats it
Aug 30 15:12:29 <lufimtse>	yea, seems like it.
Aug 30 15:12:33 <lufimtse>	I'm reading up on it.
Aug 30 15:16:23 <ipun>	sadly not very useful considering it has no commit message...
Aug 30 15:31:15 <lufimtse>	LD_LIBRARY_PATH/home/lufimtse/git/swt_dev_tools/gtk_builds/3.06
Aug 30 15:31:26 <lufimtse>	except lufimtse -> ipun
Aug 30 16:12:28 <lufimtse>	ipun, btw, to copy workspace across, I used:
Aug 30 16:12:29 <lufimtse>	rsync -avzh /home/lufimtse/workspace_neon/ ~/workspace
Aug 30 16:12:32 <lufimtse>	from host to vm
Aug 30 16:12:38 <lufimtse>	as per
Aug 30 16:12:39 <lufimtse>	http://www.tecmint.com/rsync-local-remote-file-synchronization-commands/
Aug 30 16:12:45 <lufimtse>	That way the vm uses a copy of the workspace
Aug 30 16:12:56 <lufimtse>	I just re-run the command to get a fresh copy of the workspace
Aug 30 16:13:15 <lufimtse>	the nice thing is that it just sync the changes, so it's fast if you have a big workspace. (mine is like 1.5 gb).
Aug 30 16:18:13 <ipun>	nice thanks! ive just basically copied over another workspace and renamed it somethjing else, but this definitely would be useful for syncing

Sep 01 10:54:24 <ericwill>	that comment is so useful
Sep 01 10:54:47 <ericwill>	if that ends up being true we should replace all instances of gdk_screen_get_monitor_at_window() with that
Sep 01 10:55:33 <ericwill>	that would fix https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=494771 as well
Sep 01 10:58:10 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 01 10:58:19 <lufimtse>	ipun, sup
Sep 01 10:58:48 <lufimtse>	ipun, change bug id in title, make a new change id
Sep 01 10:58:59 <lufimtse>	that should create new gerrit review.
Sep 01 11:17:19 <ipun>	ericwill thanks for the comment, that does indeed get the correct monitor
Sep 01 11:17:29 <ipun>	however, its still painting in the wrong place
Sep 01 11:17:33 <ipun>	working on finding why its doing that
Sep 01 11:18:00 <ericwill>	ipun look at ToolTip.drawTooltip()
Sep 01 11:38:30 <ipun>	have any of you guys had issues with eclipse causing your whole computer to slow down for like 2 minutes and crash
Sep 01 11:38:33 <ipun>	ive had that happen once in a while
Sep 01 11:41:32 <ericwill>	hmm
Sep 01 11:41:34 <ericwill>	nope
Sep 01 11:58:52 <ipun>	ericwill so i fixed it, but because of nonexistant documentation, i have no idea how
Sep 01 11:59:52 <ipun>	in configure () theres soooo many numbers that have no meaning
Sep 01 12:09:36 <ericwill>	ipun throw the patch onto gerrit I'll take a look
Sep 01 12:10:00 <ericwill>	oh god, looking at tooltip.configure()...
Sep 01 12:10:07 <ericwill>	what is happening here
Sep 01 12:10:38 <ericwill>	I don't think these numbers affect us, just the monitor bits
Sep 01 12:18:37 <ipun>	ericwill k i found out whats going on
Sep 01 12:18:42 <ipun>	its actually f rom configure()
Sep 01 12:18:46 <ipun>	i fixed it from there
Sep 01 12:18:56 <ipun>	i have an idea on how to fix, just needs some time

Sep 01 15:25:44 <ipun>	its annoying because GTK sees a certain monitor as 1 but its not primary in my setup
Sep 01 15:25:54 <ipun>	like, from the OS you can switch it
Sep 01 15:26:07 <ipun>	so now im trying to figure out how to get it working correctly
Sep 01 15:26:30 <ericwill>	yeah it's tricky

Sep 07 17:25:45 <lufimtse>	ipun, not afaik, but he seems to be on mattermost # Platform
Sep 08 12:13:23 <ipun>	lufimtse could you help me set up my gerrit for another repo im working on?
Sep 08 12:13:28 <ipun>	i forggot some of the steps
Sep 08 12:13:33 <lufimtse>	ipun, hey
Sep 08 12:13:34 <lufimtse>	sure
Sep 08 12:13:34 <lufimtse>	sec
Sep 08 12:25:01 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun looks like the SWT JUnit tests are broken on GTK3 for master
Sep 08 12:25:05 <ericwill>	can any of you confirm
Sep 08 12:27:21 <ericwill>	oh wait nvm
Sep 08 12:27:23 <ericwill>	I got it to work
Sep 08 12:27:26 <ericwill>	disregard :)
Sep 08 13:30:41 <lufimtse>	ericwill, :-3
Sep 08 13:31:15 <lufimtse>	I spoke with Stefan Xenos on Mattermost today, it was nice to actually be able to reach out and chat to other swt developers
Sep 08 13:31:31 <lufimtse>	too bad people don't seem to gravitate thowards freenode#swt
Sep 08 13:31:32 <lufimtse>	oh well.
Sep 08 13:41:54 <ericwill>	lufimtse yeah I'm going to download it today and check it out
Sep 08 14:08:51 <lufimtse>	kewl
Sep 08 14:09:22 <ipun>	whats next?
Sep 08 14:12:02 <ericwill>	ipun I sent you some emails
Sep 08 14:12:28 <ipun>	ericwill i gottem thanks! sorry i was asking "whats next" to leo
Sep 08 14:12:33 <ipun>	lufimtse^
Sep 08 14:12:37 <ericwill>	ipun ah lol, np
Sep 08 14:12:38 <ipun>	my eclipse has ded
Sep 08 14:22:28 <lufimtse>	@ipun, Guide on how to setup Eclipse to run nightly: https://coffeeorientedprogramming.com/2016/09/08/running-nightly-eclipse-for-the-impatient/
Sep 08 14:29:26 <ipun>	thank you!
Sep 08 14:31:58 <ericwill>	that's it for me today, talk to you guys later
Sep 08 14:32:03 <lufimtse>	ericwill, kk
Sep 08 14:32:07 <lufimtse>	have nice 1
Sep 08 14:32:14 <lufimtse>	ipun, lemme know if you get stuck somewhere
Sep 08 14:32:20 <ericwill>	lufimtse you too :)
Sep 08 14:32:32 <lufimtse>	you will need to download all the relevant 'mylyn' plugins (with gerrit integration)
Sep 08 14:32:55 <lufimtse>	Setting up a new workspace might not be a bad idea, to have a fresh start.
Sep 08 14:33:09 <lufimtse>	But the existing one should theoretically get the job done as well.
Sep 08 14:33:56 <ipun>	hokay
Sep 08 14:39:45 <ipun>	lufimtse which stuff from mylyn do i need?
Sep 08 14:40:01 <ipun>	klike
Sep 08 14:40:05 <ipun>	whats "relevent"
Sep 08 14:44:10 <ipun>	also im still having that same issue. I know eric and I figured it out a while back it had to do with some config file
Sep 08 15:14:55 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 08 15:15:06 <lufimtse>	lemme checks.
Sep 09 10:04:27 <ericwill>	morning ipun 
Sep 09 10:04:37 <ipun>	hello ericwill
Sep 09 10:05:34 <ericwill>	hello, looks like the focus patch got reverted
Sep 09 10:05:39 *	ericwill sighs
Sep 09 10:05:46 <ericwill>	you win some you lose some haha
Sep 09 10:06:06 <ipun>	i know =(
Sep 09 10:06:52 <ericwill>	looks like we need to start running the JFace tests at least once on patches
Sep 09 10:06:57 <ericwill>	which is annoying but necessary I suppose
Sep 09 10:07:11 <ipun>	lufimtse, would you be able to add that to your test script?
Sep 09 10:07:53 <ericwill>	I don't think so
Sep 09 10:08:01 <ericwill>	the test script is located in the SWT repo
Sep 09 10:08:35 <ericwill>	though maybe an optional "run jface tests too" flag/option could be added
Sep 09 10:13:54 <ipun>	yeah true
Sep 09 10:14:10 <ipun>	lemme try to fix the test suite stuff
Sep 09 10:14:28 <ericwill>	np
Sep 09 10:14:48 <ericwill>	might be worth it to write a bunch of test cases and put them into the SWT test suite too
Sep 09 10:24:17 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill, it's potentially possible to add jface stuff to the script.
Sep 09 10:24:29 <lufimtse>	the only thing it would take much much longer to execute
Sep 09 10:24:47 <ipun>	set it as a flag lufimtse 
Sep 09 10:24:49 <ericwill>	^
Sep 09 10:24:56 <ericwill>	-J or something
Sep 09 10:25:03 <lufimtse>	unless I make it so that it only runs one gtk version for jFace, and many for gtk
Sep 09 10:25:09 <ipun>	considering that it needs to be run anyways, running the thing on a VM would be the best
Sep 09 10:25:36 <lufimtse>	or a selector, which versions to test with jface, which versions to test with swt
Sep 09 10:26:03 <lufimtse>	From technical side, can be done. 
Sep 09 10:26:04 <ericwill>	lufimtse a selector sounds good. By default you could have it run the JFace tests with the same GTK3 version as the build machine
Sep 09 10:26:09 <ericwill>	(3.10 I think)
Sep 09 10:26:39 <lufimtse>	another option is to figure out how to run maven from command line, 
Sep 09 10:26:51 <lufimtse>	then run gtk_version_test && maven on jface
Sep 09 10:27:02 <lufimtse>	maven does testing
Sep 09 10:27:19 <lufimtse>	we can then pre-load LD_LIBRARY_PATH before maven runs
Sep 09 10:47:28 <ipun>	also ericwill, it kinda coordinates with how you told me the focus fix could have a test suite on it
Sep 09 10:48:00 <ericwill>	ipun yeah, now you can do the fix and add the test suites at the same time :)
Sep 09 11:19:13 <lufimtse>	ericwill, How do I test the project in here? : https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497812
Sep 09 11:19:22 <lufimtse>	I open child eclipse, but can't find any extra views
Sep 09 11:19:51 <ericwill>	lufimtse are you sure the new child eclipse is running with that plugin enabled?
Sep 09 11:21:55 <lufimtse>	Oh, I think it has some dependencies
Sep 09 11:22:03 <lufimtse>	org.eclipse.e4.core.di
Sep 09 11:22:04 <lufimtse>	meh
Sep 09 11:22:14 <lufimtse>	did you have to import those?
Sep 09 11:24:03 <lufimtse>	hmm, can't get the thing to work. Hmmmz
Sep 09 11:24:10 <ericwill>	I didn't run that project
Sep 09 11:24:43 <ericwill>	oh wait
Sep 09 11:24:45 *	ericwill checks
Sep 09 11:26:03 <lufimtse>	ericwill, oh, never mind
Sep 09 11:26:08 <lufimtse>	It's an RCP application
Sep 09 11:26:19 <lufimtse>	I went to com.vogella.eclipse.dndcontrols.product
Sep 09 11:26:25 <lufimtse>	clicked on "Launch an Eclipse application", 
Sep 09 11:26:28 <lufimtse>	snippet fired up.
Sep 09 11:26:39 <ericwill>	yes I just discovered this also lol
Sep 09 11:28:02 <ericwill>	lufimtse is that thing related to tracker/parts business?
Sep 09 11:28:07 <ericwill>	because the fix for that bug got merged already
Sep 09 11:28:31 <lufimtse>	No, but the fix contains instanceof
Sep 09 11:28:33 <lufimtse>	which is evil
Sep 09 11:29:06 <ericwill>	yeah I saw that
Sep 09 11:29:12 <ericwill>	I think in this case it is necessary though
Sep 09 11:29:38 <ericwill>	and since the instanceof is checking for Composite in Composite.java, I'm okay with it
Sep 09 11:30:08 <lufimtse>	Well, I beg to differ :-)
Sep 09 11:30:16 <lufimtse>	I'll submit a followup patch.
Sep 09 11:30:23 <ericwill>	what are your concerns?
Sep 09 11:31:53 <lufimtse>	Well, 
Sep 09 11:32:00 <lufimtse>	I'll submit patch, you'll see.
Sep 09 11:32:17 <ericwill>	ok
Sep 09 11:43:58 <ericwill>	lufimtse ah good call
Sep 09 11:44:01 <ericwill>	that patch looks good to me
Sep 09 11:44:04 <ericwill>	shall I merge?
Sep 09 11:47:00 <lufimtse>	Let's wait a day.
Sep 09 11:47:07 <lufimtse>	Then merge tomorrow if no objections.
Sep 09 11:47:15 <lufimtse>	Just to allow people to see it.
Sep 09 11:47:24 <lufimtse>	I'll followup on the bug.
Sep 09 11:47:34 <ericwill>	tomorrow is saturday :P
Sep 09 11:47:39 <ericwill>	also Monday is the code freeze for M2
Sep 09 11:47:50 <ericwill>	so if you want to wait that's fine but it will have to wait till M3
Sep 09 11:48:04 <lufimtse>	oh
Sep 09 11:48:10 <lufimtse>	thanks for pointing it out.
Sep 09 11:48:15 <lufimtse>	Hmmmmzzz
Sep 09 11:48:20 <ericwill>	I'm fine with waiting
Sep 09 11:48:22 <ericwill>	it's not urgen
Sep 09 11:48:25 <ericwill>	*urgent
Sep 09 11:48:35 <lufimtse>	Let's merge at 5pm today :-)
Sep 09 11:48:51 <ericwill>	okay you do it, I won't be on
Sep 09 11:49:03 <lufimtse>	ok, if you could +1 it...
Sep 09 11:49:06 <lufimtse>	that'd be great.
Sep 09 11:49:25 <lufimtse>	thanks for being on IRC.
Sep 09 11:49:29 <lufimtse>	~good karma.
Sep 09 11:49:59 <ericwill>	np haha
Sep 09 11:50:05 <ericwill>	good catch btw
Sep 09 11:50:12 <ericwill>	didn't think of markLayout()
Sep 09 11:52:43 <ipun>	ericwill when i run the Test_org_eclipse_swt_custom_Ccombo test it seems to pass
Sep 09 11:52:54 <ipun>	i wonder whats causing the null exception...
Sep 09 11:53:11 <ericwill>	ipun do the JFace tests fail for you locally?
Sep 09 11:53:35 <ipun>	ericwill im actually trying to figure our why none of my Jface tests are running right now ==
Sep 09 11:53:44 <lufimtse>	X-D
Sep 09 11:53:54 <lufimtse>	lemme knows if u need helpz
Sep 09 11:54:03 <ipun>	kk
Sep 09 11:54:03 <ericwill>	I mean, you gotta crawl before you can walk :D
Sep 09 12:20:01 <ipun>	ericwill lufimtse am i the only one getting failures in Jface from master branches?
Sep 09 12:20:47 <ericwill>	last time I checked a few weeks back I got some
Sep 09 12:28:22 <ipun>	hmm okay
Sep 09 12:31:17 <ipun>	ericwill i ran the jface stuff with my focus bug, doesnt seem to be a jface error =S i wonder whats causing that null exception
Sep 09 12:33:24 <ericwill>	ask Alex or lufimtse if they can reproduce the bug locally
Sep 09 12:33:47 <lufimtse>	meh?
Sep 09 12:33:50 <lufimtse>	what goes on
Sep 09 12:34:05 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun is having trouble reproducing a test failure on his machine
Sep 09 12:34:23 <lufimtse>	ericwill, do you know how the javadoc thing is constructed? is it physically using a tooltop or some browser?
Sep 09 12:34:35 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's a Browser widget
Sep 09 12:34:46 <ericwill>	it has nothing to with ToolTip.java
Sep 09 12:34:47 <lufimtse>	Do you know where to find the source?
Sep 09 12:35:06 <ericwill>	yeah it's in the JDT source code
Sep 09 12:35:20 <lufimtse>	ericwill, if it is not a tooltip, what is it? Is it a content assistant?
Sep 09 12:35:37 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's a Browser that's been shrunk down and renders HTML
Sep 09 12:35:51 <ericwill>	if you run a child eclipse and set a breakpoint in Browser.java you can see the stack trace
Sep 09 12:36:07 <lufimtse>	ah
Sep 09 12:36:22 <lufimtse>	but from a theoretical point of view, how would we call that thing?
Sep 09 12:36:30 <lufimtse>	that 'construct'?
Sep 09 12:36:37 <lufimtse>	it's not a tooltip, it's a .......
Sep 09 12:36:39 <lufimtse>	fill in dots
Sep 09 12:36:41 <ericwill>	I would call it a popup browser
Sep 09 12:36:55 <ericwill>	just like the quick outline is popup tree, etc.
Sep 09 12:37:49 <lufimtse>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window ?
Sep 09 12:37:55 <lufimtse>	I wanna argue with Dani mergerd
Sep 09 12:38:09 <lufimtse>	Megert*
Sep 09 12:38:46 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's not even a modal window because it doesn't prevent you from clicking the main Eclipse window while it's open
Sep 09 12:39:01 <ericwill>	it's literally a small widget that pops up and is clickable, and disappears if you click outside of it
Sep 09 12:39:10 <ericwill>	calling it a tooltip is just wrong lol
Sep 09 12:39:23 <lufimtse>	yea, I'm looking for a name to call it, would you refer to it as a modal_window?
Sep 09 12:39:40 <ericwill>	no
Sep 09 12:39:46 <ericwill>	modal windows disable the parent window
Sep 09 12:39:58 <ericwill>	the javadoc tooltip doesn't disable the parent Eclipse window while it's open
Sep 09 12:40:15 <lufimtse>	I see
Sep 09 12:40:15 <lufimtse>	hmm
Sep 09 12:40:38 <ipun>	lufimtse ill ask you about the errors later
Sep 09 12:40:44 <ipun>	doesnt seem to be happening on my machine or my VM
Sep 09 12:43:44 <ericwill>	lufimtse I would just argue to him that it's simply a small widget
Sep 09 12:43:55 <ericwill>	and that because of that it should at the very least have COLOR_WIDGET_* colors
Sep 09 12:44:05 <ericwill>	since it doesn't have any of the properties of a tooltip like I mentioned
Sep 09 12:46:12 <lufimtse>	ericwill, what color should it have?
Sep 09 12:46:54 <ericwill>	lufimtse it should have the same colors as a normal browser widget IMO
Sep 09 12:47:00 <ericwill>	so look in ControlExample
Sep 09 12:47:02 <ericwill>	whatever that is
Sep 09 12:47:24 <ericwill>	I think it's COLOR_WIDGET_BACKGROUND for the controls and COLOR_LIST_BACKGROUND for the content rendering area
Sep 09 12:49:42 <ericwill>	anyways lufimtse I have to run, we'll chat more next week
Sep 09 12:49:45 <ericwill>	have a good weekend :)
Sep 09 12:49:55 <lufimtse>	ericwill, thank you for feedback, have a nice one.
Sep 09 12:50:05 <lufimtse>	looking forward to having u back in office.
Sep 09 12:50:21 <ericwill>	lufimtse I know, me too. IRC is tedious -.-

Sep 09 15:01:39 <ipun>	hey lufimtse so i cant replicate the issue with the focus fix
Sep 09 15:01:54 <ipun>	not sure why, apparently it was erroring on the nightly

Sep 12 16:22:22 <ipun>	lufimtse: i realize right now date time works in a really wierd way when you do on click changes (typing it in on your own). Do you remmber any bug IDs that you worked on relating to it?
Sep 12 16:23:49 <lufimtse>	hey

Sep 12 16:26:29 <lufimtse>	Anatoly started the port, I finished it off.
Sep 12 16:26:41 <lufimtse>	It was the first SWT thing I worked on.
Sep 12 16:26:48 <ipun>	ah i see thank you
Sep 12 16:45:44 <ipun>	also lufimtse, i looked into this bug: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=197690
Sep 12 16:46:03 <ipun>	if you did a lot of work on date time, this might be easier for you to fix without disrupting too much of your logic
Sep 12 16:47:47 <ipun>	did you happen to touch anything with onNumberKeyInput()?
Sep 13 10:08:39 <ericwill>	morning gentlemen
Sep 13 10:11:29 <ipun>	morning gentlemen
Sep 13 10:13:40 <lufimtse>	It would be a while before I would get to it. I first have to resolve some DnD issues, then the webkit thing, then the wayland port etc.. 
Sep 13 10:14:06 <lufimtse>	if you want to work on something else, feel free to assign it to platform-swt-inbox and someday I might get to it.
Sep 13 10:14:49 <ericwill>	what's this?
Sep 13 10:15:37 <ipun>	wrong convo?
Sep 13 10:16:30 <ericwill>	lufimtse ?

Sep 13 10:32:43 <ericwill>	ipun okay
Sep 13 10:32:55 <ericwill>	ipun can you also write a JUnit test case for this bug?
Sep 13 10:33:22 <ipun>	okay
Sep 13 10:33:49 <ericwill>	you can put it in a separate gerrit
Sep 13 10:33:58 <ipun>	kk, part of same bug ID?
Sep 13 10:35:18 <ericwill>	yup
Sep 13 11:33:05 <ericwill>	ipun I'll review your patches sometime this week
Sep 13 11:33:11 <ericwill>	we can't merge anything till M2 is released
Sep 13 11:33:30 <ericwill>	aka Friday
Sep 13 11:53:16 <ipun>	kewl
Sep 13 11:53:29 <ipun>	ericwill im going to work on a bit of dark theme bugs in the time being
Sep 13 11:55:42 <ericwill>	ipun yeah that sounds fine :)
Sep 13 15:24:14 <ipun>	lufimtse, for one of my bugs im working on, it turns out that setBackground() is taking priority over css
Sep 13 15:24:21 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 13 15:24:30 <lufimtse>	which bugz
Sep 13 15:24:37 <lufimtse>	I'm working on Color of javadoc hover
Sep 13 15:24:44 <ipun>	it seems that after "refreshing" it (clicking a different tab, selecting it and dselcting it, etc) it fixes it
Sep 13 15:24:55 <ipun>	is there a method in control that refreshes?
Sep 13 15:25:31 <lufimtse>	meh?
Sep 13 15:25:38 <lufimtse>	What bugs u working on
Sep 13 15:26:15 <ipun>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=483789
Sep 13 15:26:50 <ipun>	like, for example, if you click on something it highlights it, meaning it overrites the color with a "highlight color"
Sep 13 15:27:02 <ipun>	once you remove the highlight (deselect), it refreshes it
Sep 13 15:27:05 <ipun>	thast just one example
Sep 13 15:28:35 <lufimtse>	Do you get that behavoiur in pure swt?
Sep 13 15:28:42 <lufimtse>	it's possible that platform UI messes with colours
Sep 13 15:29:23 <ipun>	i havent played with that in SWT no
Sep 13 15:37:18 <ipun>	actaully i think i know the issue. It seems that its directly overriting the css since it uses setBackgroundColor
Sep 13 15:37:37 <ipun>	i wonder if theres a way to see if it is using a theme
Sep 13 15:38:18 <ipun>	ill ask
Sep 14 10:26:49 <ipun>	hey lufimtse, i had to do some cleaning on my workspace, and i forgot where in the run configuations do i set it so it runs my code for platform.ui
Sep 14 10:26:58 <ipun>	that is if i was running a child elcipse

Sep 15 11:11:16 <ericwill>	no, it's another Eclipse project
Sep 15 11:11:47 <ericwill>	you can find it at git.eclipse.org/c

Sep 16 11:31:10 <ipun>	hey
Sep 16 11:31:49 <ipun>	ericwill for isDisposed(), its annoying cause I cant reproduce it im not quite sure where its hitting this problem 
Sep 16 11:32:31 <ipun>	its defs going to be a item.isDisposed() condition, im just not exactly sure what exactly it should return if it is disposed
Sep 16 11:34:01 <ericwill>	ipun probably throw the error that the javadocs says
Sep 16 11:34:16 <ericwill>	or return the topItem at index 0
Sep 16 11:34:29 <ericwill>	you'll have to investigate and see
Sep 16 11:34:42 <ericwill>	btw I posted comments on that focus bug, other than those comments it's good to go

Sep 19 14:03:54 <lufimtse>	does git blame says so?
Sep 19 14:04:05 <lufimtse>	looks vaguley familiar
Sep 19 14:04:54 <ipun>	yeah it does, but its pretty nested so im not sure if you were the original writer of that method or if you did the refactoring

Sep 20 10:37:11 <ipun>	yup
Sep 20 10:43:17 <ericwill>	hello hello
Sep 20 11:10:50 <ericwill>	lufimtse hey, can you do a pull on SWT master and see if your build.sh script works?
Sep 20 11:15:00 <ericwill>	for some reason it gives me "cd: /home/ericwill/git/eclipse.platform.swt/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/bin/library"
Sep 20 11:35:40 <ericwill>	ah nvm I figured it out
Sep 20 11:35:47 <ericwill>	you have to remove a missing entry from the SWT build path
Sep 20 11:35:57 <ericwill>	one of Alex's fixes removed something
Sep 20 11:36:03 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun ^
Sep 20 11:36:29 <ipun>	thanks bro
Sep 20 12:33:51 <ipun>	so
Sep 20 12:33:53 <ipun>	lufimtse...
Sep 20 14:48:41 <ericwill>	lufimtse I wrote a python script that parses os_custom.h, fetches the list of deprecated functions in GTK, and compares to see if any dynamic functions are deprecated
Sep 20 14:48:52 <ericwill>	...there are quite a few it seems
Sep 20 14:49:13 <ericwill>	and we never see that they're deprecated since they never run through the compiler
Sep 20 14:55:52 <ipun>	 thanks ericwill

Oct 04 11:19:39 <ipun>	lufimtse ericwill, just relaying some stuff i dissected through debugging wayland. You can just set Enviro Variable of GDK_BACKEND to 'wayland' or 'X11' for any runtime configurations 
Oct 04 11:19:50 <ipun>	i would blog about it if i had a blog
Oct 04 11:20:19 <lufimtse>	hey
Oct 04 11:20:47 <lufimtse>	That's very useful to know
Oct 04 11:21:00 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun it would be cool if we could compile a list of GTK specific environment variables somewhere
Oct 04 11:21:04 <ericwill>	maybe the wiki?
Oct 04 11:21:16 <ipun>	yeah that be cool
Oct 04 11:21:19 <ipun>	cept thats the only one i know 
Oct 04 11:21:21 <ericwill>	things like USE_CAIRO, GDK_BACKEND, etc.
Oct 04 11:22:11 <lufimtse>	ipun, consider starting a blog (e.g wordpress?). Or if you want I could give you contributor rights to my blog on coffeeorientedprogramming
Oct 04 11:22:31 <ipun>	maybe ill do a wordpress.
Oct 04 11:23:06 <ipun>	i got to do a whole bunch a crap this week with FSSOS so I might as well do a wordpress as well 
Oct 04 11:24:13 <ericwill>	are both of you guys going to FSOSS or just you ipun 
Oct 04 11:24:29 <ipun>	im not sure about lufimtse but im going and presenting
Oct 04 11:24:52 <lufimtse>	when/where is FSOSS again?
Oct 04 11:24:58 <ipun>	York Uni
Oct 04 11:25:28 <ericwill>	lufimtse how did your CSC209 lecture go?
Oct 04 11:25:36 <lufimtse>	good good.  Lots of curious faces.
Oct 04 11:25:41 <lufimtse>	have one more next week.
Oct 04 11:25:49 <lufimtse>	first one was on open source
Oct 04 11:25:58 <lufimtse>	next one will be on Tools for C development.
Oct 04 11:26:36 <ericwill>	cool
Oct 04 11:27:16 <ipun>	nice i love visual studio
Oct 04 11:27:33 <ipun>	praise M$
Oct 04 11:28:14 <ericwill>	haha
Oct 04 11:28:29 <ericwill>	lufimtse signed my paperwork for full time btw :)
Oct 04 11:49:45 <lufimtse>	ericwill, Congrats :-D!
Oct 04 11:49:56 <lufimtse>	ipun, the CSC209 prof loves visual studi
Oct 04 11:50:04 <lufimtse>	she says it's the best ide for C development.
Oct 04 11:50:30 <lufimtse>	"and neccessary to succeed in life"
Oct 04 11:50:33 <lufimtse>	lol,
Oct 04 11:51:06 *	ericwill shakes head
Oct 04 11:51:10 <ipun>	does she even notepad
Oct 04 11:52:03 <ericwill>	lufimtse thanks, can't wait till May
Oct 04 11:52:07 <ericwill>	university is annoying :P
Oct 04 11:52:22 <lufimtse>	:-P
Oct 04 12:13:59 <ericwill>	lufimtse I triaged the SWT critical bugs down to 11 bugs
Oct 04 12:14:11 <lufimtse>	X-D, omg
Oct 04 12:14:12 <ericwill>	which is more manageable, the ones left are all reproducible
Oct 04 12:14:23 <lufimtse>	very nice
Oct 04 12:14:53 <lufimtse>	If you could send your status report before 11 am on wednesday, I'd mention that on your behalf.
Oct 04 12:15:09 <ericwill>	sure, will do :)
Oct 04 12:20:00 <ericwill>	time to run, see you guys later!

Oct 05 15:31:17 <ipun>	lufimtse, the performance issues shouldnt be caused by the theming, as my snippet (no theming engine) is doing the same thing
Oct 05 15:31:30 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 05 15:33:22 <ipun>	honestly very likely a listener issue
Oct 05 15:33:32 <ipun>	im going to try to diagnose it now
Oct 05 15:33:50 <ipun>	considering its 3pm in toronto, ill be here for awhile D=
Oct 05 16:04:11 <ipun>	also lufimtse i got my snippets running correctly, but even after putting my swt source in the build path its still using the onboard SWT
Oct 05 16:06:36 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 05 16:06:49 <lufimtse>	you need to change properties
Oct 05 16:06:52 <lufimtse>	in snippet project
Oct 05 16:06:57 <lufimtse>	to use SWT project
Oct 05 16:07:25 <lufimtse>	properties -> Java build path -> projects
Oct 05 16:07:31 <lufimtse>	add swt project in there.
Oct 05 16:09:45 <ipun>	i did, no change
Oct 05 16:10:26 <ipun>	ill try restarting it
Oct 05 16:10:33 <ipun>	did a clean -> build as well
Oct 05 16:12:42 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 05 16:13:04 <lufimtse>	maybe change the "order and Export"
Oct 05 16:13:08 <lufimtse>	move swt project up
Oct 05 16:13:32 <ipun>	did that already
Oct 05 16:13:47 <ipun>	when i debug a swt snippet which goes into SWT source, it says source not found
Oct 05 16:14:15 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 05 16:14:27 <lufimtse>	can you find some tool with which I can remote connect to your system?
Oct 05 16:14:42 <lufimtse>	I could try to remote-debug :--)
Oct 05 16:14:58 <ipun>	sure
Oct 05 16:15:03 <ipun>	lemme play with it a little long
Oct 05 16:15:05 <ipun>	longer*
Oct 05 16:15:10 <ipun>	worst case teamviewer?
Oct 05 16:20:47 <ipun>	lufimtse install teamviewer for me for now, i am too lazy to find a FSOSS option
Oct 05 16:28:58 <ipun>	yeah i still cant get it done. even under run configurations org.eclipse.swt is there for source/build path, yet it cant find anything during runtime
Oct 05 16:32:23 <ipun>	k nvm
Oct 05 17:07:27 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 05 17:08:19 <lufimtse>	Can you try to find something FSOSS? We could re-use it for other people also, (e.g Eric)... Maybe ask on red hat tech list about it?
Oct 05 17:08:28 <lufimtse>	Someone's bound to know some tool.
Oct 05 17:09:09 <lufimtse>	I'll be back tomorrow.

Oct 06 14:59:14 <ipun>	hey lufimtse good news, i thnk i found out whats causing the delay with ctab folders
Oct 06 14:59:32 <ipun>	which also might link to issues with ctabfolders in eclipse being put somewhere else when clicked
Oct 06 14:59:41 <lufimtse>	?
Oct 06 14:59:43 <ipun>	something with the listener Swt.DragDetect is busted
Oct 06 14:59:51 <lufimtse>	Could be
Oct 06 15:00:02 <lufimtse>	In one of my fixes, I implemented a timer that waits for a short time.
Oct 06 15:00:05 <ipun>	when i comment it out in CtabFolder, it runs normally
Oct 06 15:00:07 <lufimtse>	I wonder if that's to blame.
Oct 06 15:00:10 <ipun>	im not sure
Oct 06 15:00:14 <ipun>	whats the commit for that?
Oct 06 15:00:19 <lufimtse>	bleh, 
Oct 06 15:00:20 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 06 15:00:29 <lufimtse>	that was a while ago..
Oct 06 15:00:30 <ipun>	but the timer doesnt occur in X11, this issue only happens in wayland
Oct 06 15:00:36 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 06 15:00:44 <lufimtse>	I gotta checks. Hold on. 
Oct 06 15:02:26 <lufimtse>	git log show d75a51833886fedc47fd1992d6bcd02c341104d6
Oct 06 15:02:38 <lufimtse>	try to dissable that timer, see if that makes a difference
Oct 06 15:03:02 <lufimtse>	My fix for DnD is a bit of a hack. 
Oct 06 15:03:15 <lufimtse>	It was done in my early days :-)
Oct 06 15:03:51 <lufimtse>	I should ideally re-work that patch someday
Oct 06 15:06:57 <ipun>	'someday'
Oct 06 15:07:57 <ipun>	also there isnt any stable tiling manager for wayland yet
Oct 06 15:08:14 <ipun>	tried one called Sway, doesnt work very well so im not resorting to gnome for weayland testing
Oct 06 15:12:02 <ipun>	okay, so it looks like dragDetect gets triggered on CTabFolder only in wayland 
Oct 06 15:12:05 <ipun>	this is good, im getting somewhere
Oct 06 15:18:02 <ipun>	when you have time, could you explain your reasoning on the timer? and pehaps where the method/logic is set for how SWT know this is a dragDetect event?
Oct 06 15:18:14 <ipun>	lemme know here im going to lunch
Oct 06 15:23:18 <lufimtse>	ok
Oct 06 15:23:25 <lufimtse>	the comment kinda outlinesi t.
Oct 06 15:23:27 <lufimtse>	outlines it
Oct 06 15:25:12 <lufimtse>	as a note, you might have to update your jhbuild someday

Oct 07 14:31:20 <ipun>	lufimtse so i found out where the bug is, and it is going to fix the drag + drop issue and also the lag
Oct 07 14:31:26 <lufimtse>	hey
Oct 07 14:31:27 <ipun>	however, i am not sure how to approach it.
Oct 07 14:31:46 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 07 14:31:49 <lufimtse>	so the timer thing
Oct 07 14:31:52 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 07 14:31:53 <ipun>	wyes
Oct 07 14:31:55 <ipun>	but 
Oct 07 14:31:58 <lufimtse>	we should set up some verbal chat system
Oct 07 14:32:00 <lufimtse>	meh
Oct 07 14:32:01 <ipun>	its not the timers problem
Oct 07 14:32:01 <lufimtse>	ok, let
Oct 07 14:32:04 <lufimtse>	timer
Oct 07 14:32:05 <lufimtse>	soo
Oct 07 14:32:09 <lufimtse>	the thing about gtk3
Oct 07 14:32:19 <lufimtse>	is that it stopped sending events when mouse moves in dnd
Oct 07 14:32:23 <lufimtse>	for some reason
Oct 07 14:32:29 <lufimtse>	(I should investigate that..)
Oct 07 14:32:35 <lufimtse>	so DnD stopped working
Oct 07 14:32:40 <lufimtse>	because it relied on motion events
Oct 07 14:32:46 <lufimtse>	so
Oct 07 14:32:55 <lufimtse>	I set a timer, that checks for motion every 50 ms
Oct 07 14:33:02 <lufimtse>	it checks for motion by checking mouse position.
Oct 07 14:33:07 <lufimtse>	manually
Oct 07 14:33:11 <lufimtse>	thus the timer
Oct 07 14:33:16 <lufimtse>	it's a hacky solution
Oct 07 14:33:22 <lufimtse>	my early works... 
Oct 07 14:33:27 <lufimtse>	>__>
Oct 07 14:33:31 <lufimtse>	but worked so far.
Oct 07 14:33:37 <ipun>	ah yes its this call right/
Oct 07 14:33:39 <ipun>	gtk_drag_check_threshold
Oct 07 14:33:46 <lufimtse>	<__<
Oct 07 14:33:51 <lufimtse>	^__^
Oct 07 14:33:57 <ipun>	anyways
Oct 07 14:33:58 <lufimtse>	hack comes back to bite me. 
Oct 07 14:33:58 <ipun>	its not your fault
Oct 07 14:34:05 <ipun>	theres still an issue 
Oct 07 14:34:25 <ipun>	basically, the reason why the timer is set off in Wayland is that gdk_event_get() is not returning anything
Oct 07 14:34:39 <ipun>	AND, using your hack, it doesnt notice any drag 
Oct 07 14:34:40 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 07 14:34:43 <ipun>	but
Oct 07 14:35:16 <ipun>	theres a condition that if event == 0 still, return dragOnTimeout, which is true for some reason
Oct 07 14:35:51 <ipun>	but the main issue i think is that gdk_event_get() is not returning anything on a mouse down 
Oct 07 14:36:20 <ipun>	which is why i am thinking this is a GTK bug? but I am not sure if thats true or not, as  idont know how to replicate this on GTk 
Oct 07 14:36:31 <ipun>	consdering how complex this method is being used 
Oct 07 14:39:34 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 07 14:39:49 <lufimtse>	by not return anything you mean it get's stuck or returns null?
Oct 07 14:40:07 <ipun>	returns 0
Oct 07 14:40:30 <ipun>	in X11, it returns an event, thats why cTabFolder moves away from the timeout
Oct 07 14:40:53 <ipun>	however in wayland, no event is returned, so it falls into the timeout loop (500ms) and
Oct 07 14:41:02 <ipun>	somehow defaults to it being "dragged"
Oct 07 14:41:15 <ipun>	which causes eclipse when clicking around tabs to think im dragging them
Oct 07 14:41:51 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 07 14:41:53 <ipun>	this is all in control.java line 2475
Oct 07 14:41:55 <lufimtse>	lemme read some code
Oct 07 14:41:58 <ipun>	kk
Oct 07 14:48:33 <ipun>	i fixed the timeout issue i think, but im trying tofix the drag and drop bug
Oct 07 14:48:44 <ipun>	in line 2509, you had an if condition about dragging
Oct 07 14:49:15 <ipun>	i removed the condition and just made it break instead
Oct 07 14:49:30 <ipun>	i tested it on eclipse anddrag and drop seems to still work for now

Oct 07 14:51:55 <lufimtse>	interesting
Oct 07 14:53:25 <lufimtse>	I think the if (dragging) break; is needed for dragging to start 'early' enough
Oct 07 14:53:38 <lufimtse>	otherwise DnD might only start after 500ms
Oct 07 14:55:36 <lufimtse>	For patches, add me as reviewer :-)
Oct 07 14:56:55 <ipun>	okay
Oct 07 15:00:47 <ipun>	im more confused about the dragOnTimeout garbage, this seemed to be added a while back (not by you)
Oct 07 15:00:49 <ipun>	causing errors
Oct 07 15:01:20 <ipun>	that, or this could be a gdk_event_get bug
Oct 07 15:01:34 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 07 15:01:46 <ipun>	but your saying that your fix as because events in gtk3 dont always populate?
Oct 07 15:02:18 <lufimtse>	Well, gtk3 stopped sending motion events during DnD
Oct 07 15:02:20 <lufimtse>	not sure when
Oct 07 15:02:34 <lufimtse>	Given what I know now, I'd have bisected it to find the gtk version that introduced the change.
Oct 07 15:02:47 <lufimtse>	At the time I didn't even know how to compile gtk
Oct 07 15:02:58 <ipun>	hmm okay
Oct 07 15:22:48 <ipun>	im going to work on it a bit more, do you think its applicable to do somtehing like, if (wayland)?

Oct 18 10:00:42 <ericwill>	ipun what are you working on these days
Oct 18 10:00:46 <ericwill>	wayland stuff?
Oct 18 10:04:05 <ipun>	yeah
Oct 18 10:04:11 <ipun>	its a pain
Oct 18 10:06:58 <ipun>	ericwill theres an issue with cTab in wayland where it thinks its drag and dropping
Oct 18 10:07:02 <ipun>	everytime you click on it
Oct 18 10:07:16 <ipun>	i found the problem im just trying to diagnose if its GTK or us
Oct 18 10:07:38 <ipun>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=503431
Oct 18 10:18:27 <ericwill>	ipun ah yeah
Oct 18 10:18:33 <ericwill>	lots of Wayland work to be done I am sure
Oct 18 10:20:08 <ipun>	mmhm
Oct 18 10:36:05 <ericwill>	lufimtse http://www.eclipse.org/swt/triage.php
Oct 18 11:02:44 <ipun>	lufimtse: played around with using different GTK versions to see if i can get it running, looks like GTK2 works 
Oct 18 11:02:50 <ipun>	but im not sure if GTK2 even supports wayland
Oct 18 11:03:00 <lufimtse>	:-)
Oct 18 11:03:04 <ipun>	considering i cant use GTK inspector, im not sure if my snippet is running in wayland or just defaulted to x11
Oct 18 11:03:07 <lufimtse>	Gtk2 has no wayland support.
Oct 18 11:03:12 <ipun>	ah.
Oct 18 11:03:15 <ipun>	hm.
Oct 18 11:03:20 <lufimtse>	Waynand was not around back then.
Oct 18 11:07:54 <ipun>	well, this annoys me.
Oct 18 11:08:24 <ericwill>	ipun this is what makes Wayland work more tricky
Oct 18 11:08:54 <ipun>	i cant replicate gdk_event_get() behavior on a GTK snippet which annoys me even more
Oct 18 11:09:28 <lufimtse>	Interesting... 
Oct 18 11:09:30 <ipun>	i have a good feeling its a GTK problem but its taking me some time to prove it
Oct 18 11:14:40 <ericwill>	this is interesting: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=78971
Oct 18 12:17:45 <ipun>	lufimtse ericwill, i dont actualyl think gdk_event_get() has been updated to work with wayland
Oct 18 12:17:58 <lufimtse>	hey
Oct 18 12:18:02 <ipun>	older references about gdk_event_get imply it works on X servers
Oct 18 12:18:17 <ipun>	but, doing some git blame the method calls behind it hasnt been updated for many years now
Oct 18 12:19:26 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 18 12:20:28 <lufimtse>	ipun, checkout display.java:826
Oct 18 12:20:35 <lufimtse>	checkIfEventProc(...)
Oct 18 12:20:40 <lufimtse>	line 835
Oct 18 12:20:46 <lufimtse>	and 836
Oct 18 12:21:04 <lufimtse>	if (window == 0) return 0;
Oct 18 12:21:11 <lufimtse>	Try removing that line.
Oct 18 12:21:12 <ipun>	hmmmm....
Oct 18 12:21:14 <ipun>	oaky
Oct 18 12:21:14 <lufimtse>	See woot happens.
Oct 18 12:21:36 <lufimtse>	Does that code run on regular gtk3?
Oct 18 12:21:44 <lufimtse>	Does it even initiate on Wayland?
Oct 18 12:22:06 <ipun>	checkEventProc only runs in X11
Oct 18 12:22:13 <ipun>	neverr gets called in Wayland
Oct 18 12:24:04 <lufimtse>	I think it's a callback
Oct 18 12:24:18 <ipun>	as in?
Oct 18 12:24:18 <lufimtse>	related to expose flashing.
Oct 18 12:24:28 <lufimtse>	expose event I think is when widget is 'visible' to user
Oct 18 12:24:33 <lufimtse>	or visibility changes.
Oct 18 12:24:34 <lufimtse>	hmmmmmmmmmmmm
Oct 18 12:24:52 <lufimtse>	What if you comment out the content of that call and run in X11, does the same issue occur?
Oct 18 12:25:06 <lufimtse>	or dose it magically work well on X11 still
Oct 18 12:25:57 <lufimtse>	Also, does the native GTK snippet work on Gtk3, but not on Wayland, or not work in any situation? 
Oct 18 12:26:30 <ipun>	commetning out the contents leads to it working in X11 still
Oct 18 12:26:49 <ipun>	the proble, with the GTK snippet is that i cant get gdk_event_get() to work correctly in both wayland and X11
Oct 18 12:26:55 <ipun>	its not getting any events in the first place
Oct 18 12:27:09 <ipun>	when i run it it returns null even with a while loop timeout
Oct 18 12:29:10 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 18 12:29:11 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 18 12:29:33 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 18 12:29:47 <ipun>	from the looks of how SWT implements it, it doesnt seem to do any hacky "gdk_put_event()" stuff
Oct 18 12:29:57 <ipun>	so that event shouldve been generated from GTK, which it didnt
Oct 18 12:30:17 <lufimtse>	I found I had similar issue with DnD
Oct 18 12:30:25 <lufimtse>	the motion event was no longer being generated.
Oct 18 12:30:41 <lufimtse>	I should have drilled down to native Gtk level. Instead I implemented DnD on java level
Oct 18 12:30:46 <lufimtse>	lol
Oct 18 12:30:48 <lufimtse>	X-D
Oct 18 12:30:57 <lufimtse>	that was on Gtk3
Oct 18 12:31:06 <lufimtse>	Try with Gtk3.6
Oct 18 12:31:08 <lufimtse>	or Gtk3.3
Oct 18 12:31:10 <lufimtse>	or Gtk3.4
Oct 18 12:31:16 <lufimtse>	I mean the native snippet... 
Oct 18 12:31:29 <lufimtse>	I wonder if something broke going up from older versions
Oct 18 12:31:31 <ipun>	yeah motion isnt being geenrated iether
Oct 18 12:31:44 <lufimtse>	Do other events get generated?
Oct 18 12:31:46 <lufimtse>	like expose?
Oct 18 12:31:51 <ipun>	i havent tested
Oct 18 12:31:58 <lufimtse>	Maybe get it to work for some events
Oct 18 12:32:03 <lufimtse>	like once we know and love
Oct 18 12:32:06 <lufimtse>	like button down
Oct 18 12:32:12 <lufimtse>	and mouse movement events
Oct 18 12:32:13 <ipun>	currently from my swt snippet, X11 generates motion and gtk_button_release
Oct 18 12:32:28 <lufimtse>	what about movement events while button not pressed.
Oct 18 12:32:34 <ipun>	doesnt seem so 
Oct 18 12:32:42 <lufimtse>	does it work on gtk2?
Oct 18 12:32:46 <ipun>	the movement event seems to generate on x11 when im not clicking on it 
Oct 18 12:33:22 <lufimtse>	sekunde... 
Oct 18 12:43:14 <lufimtse>		while (*JsCallFinished == FALSE) {
Oct 18 12:43:14 <lufimtse>			g_main_context_iteration(0, FALSE);
Oct 18 12:43:14 <lufimtse>		}

Oct 19 14:10:02 <ipun>	lufimtse my fix seems to fix the issue + have D&D working
Oct 19 14:11:49 <ipun>	but, it still relies on MOTION_NOTIFY instead of the click event
Oct 19 14:31:14 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 19 14:31:19 <lufimtse>	we kinda want motion notify
Oct 19 14:31:35 <lufimtse>	I wrote the fix because motion notify wasn't being sent
Oct 19 14:31:52 <lufimtse>	take my fix out. Should fix dnd 
Oct 19 14:32:08 <lufimtse>	add mainloop read thing
Oct 19 14:32:23 <lufimtse>	oh, you mean instead*
Oct 19 14:32:24 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 19 14:32:42 <lufimtse>	so u not getting button release at all?
Oct 20 09:56:22 <ipun>	lufimtse, it seems that running g_main_context_iteration () processes the events, but then the vents dont show up in event_get anymore
Oct 20 09:56:43 <ipun>	and i cant seem to find a way to grab the even that is being processed by g_main_context_iteration

Oct 20 11:51:28 <ipun>	lufimtse ping got a question for you
Oct 20 11:51:56 <ipun>	im thinking about mergig gtk_button_press_event with _release_event
Oct 20 11:52:06 <ipun>	but im not exactly sure the best way to do with without causing huge conflict
Oct 20 15:00:07 <lufimtse>	as discussed... 
Oct 20 15:05:03 <ipun>	lufimtse doesnt look like you can get mouse status, im going to try another way potientally
Oct 20 15:05:27 <lufimtse>	did gtk folks say?
Oct 20 15:07:10 <lufimtse>	Have a look:
Oct 20 15:07:10 <lufimtse>	https://developer.gnome.org/gdk3/stable/gdk3-Windows.html#gdk-window-get-device-position
Oct 20 15:07:17 <lufimtse>	 GdkModifierType *mask);
Oct 20 15:07:22 <lufimtse>	-->>> mask
Oct 20 15:07:33 <lufimtse>	GDK_BUTTON1_MASK
Oct 20 15:07:33 <lufimtse>		
Oct 20 15:07:33 <lufimtse>	the first mouse button.
Oct 20 15:07:46 <lufimtse>	in SWT, we use that call: org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.getCursorLocationInPixels()
Oct 20 15:08:15 <lufimtse>	Actually, this is better: org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.gdk_window_get_device_position(long, int[], int[], int[])
Oct 20 15:08:25 <lufimtse>	the last paramater is mask
Oct 20 15:08:33 <lufimtse>	No hard labour needed
Oct 20 15:08:49 <lufimtse>	just use that call, check if that mask contains the BUTTON1 mask.
Oct 20 15:08:54 <lufimtse>	job done.
Oct 20 15:09:00 <lufimtse>	Hopefully :-P
Oct 20 15:09:32 <lufimtse>	I was thinking of going to the cat rescue this weekend maybe.

Oct 31 10:20:47 <ipun>	i did it a while back, i just did it on the website

Oct 31 10:21:06 <ipun>	well the comment was changed 
Oct 31 10:21:20 <ipun>	all i did was change the wording of the comment, and then commented on your own comment
Oct 31 10:22:15 <ipun>	anyways, for your second comment, 2nd/3rd click mouse buttons dont need to be checked as those are not normal buttons used for drag and drop; not used in chrome or any other tab-type applcaitions from my experience
Oct 31 11:24:18 <ipun>	lufimtse let me know if the gerrit change is good so i can close it
Oct 31 14:42:37 <ipun>	tested on wayland, its all good

Nov 08 10:27:29 <ipun>	hey lufimtse, do you think its viable to close https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=501420
Nov 08 10:27:44 <ipun>	last comment basically is the issue, but its been solved (i believe)
Nov 08 10:27:51 <ipun>	doesnt look like anyone followed up with closing the bug
Nov 08 10:27:51 <lufimtse>	hey
Nov 08 10:30:55 <lufimtse>	It seems that the related bug 505923 was fixed. So maybe this bug is fixed also. You could post into the bug suggesting to close it and close it in a week if no one replies.
Nov 08 10:32:40 <ipun>	okay sounds good

Nov 08 14:39:08 <ipun>	lufimtse https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=503431
Nov 08 14:39:43 <ipun>	was fully tested from your comments on gerrit
Nov 08 14:39:47 <ipun>	responded on bugzilla
Nov 08 14:48:49 <lufimtse>	hullo
Nov 08 14:49:40 <lufimtse>	I think last time I asked if it's possible to get this done without use of context_iteration?
Nov 08 14:49:56 <lufimtse>	what happens if you remove that context iteration, but still check status of mouse in the loop?
Nov 08 14:50:11 <lufimtse>	does that work at all or is context iteration absolutley neccessary?
Nov 08 14:50:12 <ipun>	yeah i did that
Nov 08 14:50:18 <ipun>	i thought i told you already here on this channel
Nov 08 14:50:20 <ipun>	it doesnt work
Nov 08 14:50:23 <lufimtse>	I ese
Nov 08 14:50:28 <lufimtse>	I see
Nov 08 14:50:32 <ipun>	if you dont have a context iteration the event never moves on 
Nov 08 14:50:38 <ipun>	it times out pretty much
Nov 08 14:50:59 <lufimtse>	Lemme see patch

Nov 08 15:17:14 <lufimtse>	ipun, could you rebase?

Mar 21 14:04:35 <ipun>	pulled in a bigger audience than last time ( got around ~20 people) 
Mar 21 14:05:28 <ericwill>	nice
Mar 21 14:05:34 <ericwill>	did you meet Lars?
Mar 21 14:05:41 <ericwill>	and did you meet any of the IBM guys?
Mar 21 14:39:07 <lufimtse>	hey
Mar 21 14:39:08 <lufimtse>	sup
Mar 21 14:50:43 <ipun>	lufimtse:did you find the root of the dnd problem? 
Mar 21 14:50:51 <lufimtse>	yah
Mar 21 14:50:53 <lufimtse>	2 memory leack
Mar 21 14:50:54 <lufimtse>	s
Mar 21 14:50:59 <ipun>	ah okay
Mar 21 14:51:01 <ipun>	thanks for finding it!
Mar 21 14:51:05 <lufimtse>	fixed one, fix for other I'm about to push
Mar 21 14:51:15 <lufimtse>	I kinda didn't know Callback.java had to be disposed
Mar 21 14:51:23 <lufimtse>	so I kinda helped you introduce those memory leaks lol.
Mar 21 14:51:28 <ipun>	hopefully thats the most major problems we'll see with my dnd patch
Mar 21 14:51:35 *	ipun shrugs
Mar 21 14:51:54 <lufimtse>	There's still some kinda derp going on. After a while, view-parts dnd stops working.
Mar 21 14:51:55 <lufimtse>	derp
Mar 21 14:52:47 <ipun>	realy?
Mar 21 14:52:52 <ipun>	never had that issue on my end
Mar 21 14:53:04 <ipun>	must be some gesture callback problem
Mar 21 15:02:01 <ipun>	lufimtse ericwill : where can i check if my patches were in M6 or not?
Mar 21 15:02:25 <lufimtse>	If they're older than when M6 was released, they're part of M6.
Mar 21 15:02:36 <ericwill>	yeah if they were merged before the freeze date, it's in
Mar 21 15:04:47 <ipun>	where can i find the freeze date
Mar 21 15:06:08 <ericwill>	ipun https://wiki.eclipse.org/Oxygen/Simultaneous_Release_Plan#Schedule
Mar 21 15:06:17 <ipun>	thank you
Mar 21 15:07:34 <ipun>	ericwill: date says march 17, does that mean everything committed to master before the 17th is in m6?
Mar 21 15:08:31 <ericwill>	ipun I think so?
Mar 21 15:09:51 <ipun>	okay

Apr 06 12:15:17 <lufimtse>	Welcome Alex.
Apr 06 12:15:32 <akurtakov>	ipun: so are you going to revert everything ?
Apr 06 12:15:37 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hey :)
Apr 06 12:15:58 <ipun>	akurtakov: trust me, i have no choice
Apr 06 12:16:07 <lufimtse>	note:
Apr 06 12:16:08 <ipun>	but after the revert, i plan on adding the changes
Apr 06 12:16:11 <ipun>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94497/
Apr 06 12:16:26 <ipun>	this changeset basically includes the full revert + some development ive done that may solve this
Apr 06 12:16:57 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 12:17:09 <akurtakov>	I trust lufimtse for proper review
Apr 06 12:17:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the idea here is to keep DnD as part of MouseDown. It's not neccessarily what Gtk does, but it preserves Cocoa/Win32 compatability.
Apr 06 12:17:39 <lufimtse>	And thus custom widgets would not have to be changed.
Apr 06 12:18:27 <akurtakov>	this would not affect the gestures supprot, right?
Apr 06 12:18:36 <lufimtse>	you mean swiping?
Apr 06 12:18:37 <ipun>	akurtakov: no it wont
Apr 06 12:18:38 <akurtakov>	it shouldn't but I want to be sure
Apr 06 12:18:43 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 12:18:49 <ipun>	the way i implemented it wont affect this
Apr 06 12:19:52 <ipun>	there should be a dragGesture set on it nonetheless
Apr 06 12:20:12 <ipun>	but for consistency ill test it on my laptop
Apr 06 12:21:26 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 12:21:49 <akurtakov>	the patch is not ready for test yet, right?
Apr 06 12:22:00 <ipun>	its ready for testing for x11/wayland
Apr 06 12:24:08 <akurtakov>	http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2017/04/thank-you-note-to-hackernews.html
Apr 06 12:25:29 <ipun>	what a great day
Apr 06 12:27:01 <akurtakov>	https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/06/canonical_cuts_jobs_with_unity_bullet/
Apr 06 12:27:07 <akurtakov>	ubuntu seems to be sinking
Apr 06 12:30:08 <ipun>	akurtakov: confirmed that gestures is working
Apr 06 12:30:12 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 12:37:24 <ipun>	akurtakov: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94497/
Apr 06 12:37:27 <ipun>	thats the reverted changes
Apr 06 12:37:46 <ipun>	did you want me to do another commit that shows the additional patch on top of that revert?
Apr 06 12:37:55 <akurtakov>	ipun: exactly
Apr 06 12:38:05 <akurtakov>	so when I fetch the second one I get everything in shape 
Apr 06 12:38:49 <ipun>	akurtakov: did you want it in a different gerrit review or as a new patchset?
Apr 06 12:39:06 <akurtakov>	another review on top of the revert one
Apr 06 12:43:38 <ipun>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94597/
Apr 06 12:43:43 <ipun>	akurtakov ^
Apr 06 12:49:08 <akurtakov>	ipun: still when full line selection dnd is activated instead deselection
Apr 06 12:49:16 <akurtakov>	but not always tbh
Apr 06 12:50:04 <akurtakov>	for both x11 and wayland
Apr 06 12:50:31 <akurtakov>	if everything is reverted why break x11 ?
Apr 06 12:51:23 <akurtakov>	I insist on leaving x11 on being in the way it is currently
Apr 06 12:51:41 <ipun>	akurtakov: because lufimtse said to do it for x11 too :)
Apr 06 12:51:46 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: NO
Apr 06 12:51:49 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 06 12:52:00 <ipun>	akurtakov: i insisted no
Apr 06 12:52:04 *	ipun shrugs
Apr 06 12:52:20 <akurtakov>	any chance of potential breakage now should be reduced
Apr 06 12:52:45 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: please take this seriously, we can not afford more X11 regressions
Apr 06 12:53:15 <akurtakov>	no matter you like it or not - it stays how it is until wayland proven tobe stable
Apr 06 12:54:18 <akurtakov>	once wayland is stable we can speak of unifying 
Apr 06 12:54:26 <akurtakov>	we are almost at M7 and everything is broken
Apr 06 12:54:27 <lufimtse>	May I suggest to leave things as is until Oxygen is released and then work on things?
Apr 06 12:54:44 <akurtakov>	for x11 yes 
Apr 06 12:54:53 <akurtakov>	for wayland - it has to work in Oxygen
Apr 06 12:55:12 <ipun>	lufimtse: we can still include the fix i did and guard it with isX11
Apr 06 12:56:14 <akurtakov>	ipun: +1
Apr 06 12:56:34 <ipun>	lufimtse: ill even comment it with // Wayland for you :)
Apr 06 12:56:37 <akurtakov>	further more on x11 the new patch doesn't switch ctabs with first click but with secon
Apr 06 12:56:40 <lufimtse>	In the sense I wasn't planning on the new DnD changes to take place until after Oxygen.
Apr 06 12:56:52 <lufimtse>	./forgot to mention. 
Apr 06 12:57:08 <lufimtse>	We're ok with having a bunch of !x11 guards
Apr 06 12:57:13 <lufimtse>	so long as current code stays same.
Apr 06 12:58:02 <akurtakov>	btw with the new code
Apr 06 12:58:33 <akurtakov>	I end up with the old funny bug of moving around ctabs instead of switching them on wayland
Apr 06 12:58:50 <ipun>	akurtakov: yeah i just noticed that
Apr 06 12:58:57 <ipun>	sigh 
Apr 06 12:59:08 <ipun>	this really sucks 
Apr 06 12:59:13 <akurtakov>	that's worse than current master which has only StyledText broken on wayland
Apr 06 12:59:17 <lufimtse>	It might be because MouseRelease is fired before MouseDown is finished.
Apr 06 12:59:47 <lufimtse>	Not sure thou. 
Apr 06 13:03:36 <akurtakov>	so guys, let's make things clear on one thing - x11 stays as it is and everything regarding wayland is guarded with if !x11
Apr 06 13:03:53 <akurtakov>	for at least 2 milestones once we put it int
Apr 06 13:03:58 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, We initially started moving DnD logic into MouseMovement, because that's the 'gtk' method of doing it and is more sound. However, after time we discovered that this approach causes breakage in Custom widgets.    -> As such we are now seeking to get DnD logic to work in MouseDown for wayland.
Apr 06 13:04:09 <akurtakov>	until even thinking of unifying it
Apr 06 13:04:29 <lufimtse>	I have no objections against if !x11 guard for now.
Apr 06 13:05:17 <akurtakov>	so are we saying we go with MouseMove for wayland and MouseDown for x11 for Oxygen?
Apr 06 13:05:32 <lufimtse>	No,
Apr 06 13:05:36 <lufimtse>	hmm
Apr 06 13:05:41 <lufimtse>	sec.
Apr 06 13:05:52 <akurtakov>	this is what we have in master, right?
Apr 06 13:06:03 <akurtakov>	fwiw, it's the best thing I have seen so far
Apr 06 13:06:28 <lufimtse>	X11 will be same as is now in oxygen, no changes
Apr 06 13:06:32 <lufimtse>	for Wayland .... 
Apr 06 13:06:41 <lufimtse>	1) We will work on mouseDown solution
Apr 06 13:06:46 <lufimtse>	2) In mean time leave mouseMove
Apr 06 13:07:02 <lufimtse>	if mouseDown solution is good to go, use that in Oxygen. If not, leave mouse move.
Apr 06 13:07:08 <lufimtse>	does that make sense?
Apr 06 13:07:33 <akurtakov>	ok, when do we put the deadline for that decision?
Apr 06 13:08:15 <lufimtse>	I think deadline is dependent on if MouseMove method will be up and running in time. I propose to keep things in patches and out of master for now.
Apr 06 13:08:49 <lufimtse>	At least until Oxygen release.
Apr 06 13:09:14 <lufimtse>	This should ensure consistent behaviour until we are ready for switch. 
Apr 06 13:09:28 <lufimtse>	For the switch, we will be doing extensive testing to make sure all reported regressions do not occur.
Apr 06 13:10:44 <lufimtse>	Thoughts?
Apr 06 13:12:58 <akurtakov>	well, I still want wayland + oxygen in better shape
Apr 06 13:13:35 <lufimtse>	Can you define "better", do you mean functioning styledText?
Apr 06 13:14:13 <akurtakov>	yes if possible
Apr 06 13:14:23 <akurtakov>	or at least what we can get 
Apr 06 13:14:29 <lufimtse>	This would require us to get MouseDown solution working.
Apr 06 13:14:30 <akurtakov>	even if it's baby steps 
Apr 06 13:14:35 <lufimtse>	on wayland
Apr 06 13:14:39 <akurtakov>	or improve on the MouseMove
Apr 06 13:14:51 <lufimtse>	MouseMove has architectural problem,
Apr 06 13:15:09 <akurtakov>	for which I want a deadline - how much time do we give MouseDown to see it's working
Apr 06 13:15:16 <lufimtse>	I see.
Apr 06 13:15:19 <lufimtse>	Hmmm.
Apr 06 13:15:27 <lufimtse>	Let me think.
Apr 06 13:15:32 <akurtakov>	it may have arch problem but it is smth that we will release in June
Apr 06 13:15:47 <akurtakov>	and will live with us for the next 14-16 months
Apr 06 13:15:58 <lufimtse>	Is "IS_GTK" accetable in styled text?
Apr 06 13:16:11 <lufimtse>	and CTabFolder?
Apr 06 13:16:33 <akurtakov>	no, because IS_GTK solution would do changes for x11 too - which is unwanted
Apr 06 13:16:46 <akurtakov>	and this is jsut the tip of the iceberg
Apr 06 13:16:47 <lufimtse>	Then we have a problem with MouseMove approach.
Apr 06 13:17:05 <lufimtse>	MouseMove + Stayled text requires IS_GTK. 
Apr 06 13:17:22 <lufimtse>	As such, we have to push for MouseDown.
Apr 06 13:17:31 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 06 13:17:42 <lufimtse>	Please give me a few minutes to think.
Apr 06 13:18:01 <akurtakov>	or it requires if (!x11 && control instanceof StyledText) kind of hacks in Drag*
Apr 06 13:19:16 <akurtakov>	ipun: do you think you can enhance StyledText after trippleclick on wayland with current master
Apr 06 13:19:43 <lufimtse>	Interesting...
Apr 06 13:20:09 <akurtakov>	and we continue fighting wayland that way as we find issues
Apr 06 13:20:29 <lufimtse>	BTW, can we modify things until RC3 Friday, June 09?
Apr 06 13:21:55 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: with each next step you need one more additional +1
Apr 06 13:21:58 <akurtakov>	first one more committer
Apr 06 13:22:08 <akurtakov>	next +project lead
Apr 06 13:22:14 <akurtakov>	next + PMC approval
Apr 06 13:24:50 <akurtakov>	see here from last year
Apr 06 13:25:45 <akurtakov>	https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/freeze_plan_4_6.php#FixPassAfterRC0 specifically
Apr 06 13:27:16 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: this year will be pretty much the same
Apr 06 13:29:49 <lufimtse>	I see.
Apr 06 13:30:23 <lufimtse>	So basically we have until May 4th to make changes freely, after that it's difficult?
Apr 06 13:30:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, is that correct?
Apr 06 13:30:49 <akurtakov>	yes
Apr 06 13:31:05 <lufimtse>	In that case, I have the following suggestion:
Apr 06 13:31:19 <lufimtse>	- We stick to current MouseMove and try to hack things via instanceOf
Apr 06 13:31:29 <lufimtse>	- THEN, work on MouseDown architecture
Apr 06 13:31:33 <akurtakov>	works for me
Apr 06 13:32:00 <akurtakov>	THEN might be delayed  though
Apr 06 13:32:10 <lufimtse>	I see.
Apr 06 13:32:26 <akurtakov>	as we need also Webkit2 finished early in Photon too
Apr 06 13:32:43 <lufimtse>	feasible.
Apr 06 13:33:36 <lufimtse>	So my understanding ME:  DnD polish && Webkit2 polish -> Oxygen release -> Webkit2 Browser function && DnD MouseDown architecture
Apr 06 13:33:40 <lufimtse>	that correct?
Apr 06 13:33:52 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Apr 06 13:34:24 <akurtakov>	after Oxygen release -> + ton of other things :)
Apr 06 13:34:29 <lufimtse>	X-D
Apr 06 13:34:30 <lufimtse>	ok.
Apr 06 13:34:35 <lufimtse>	Fair game.
Apr 06 13:34:49 <lufimtse>	I'm off to lunch.
Apr 06 13:34:56 <lufimtse>	I'll chat with Ian in a bit.
Apr 06 13:36:04 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 14:29:39 <ipun>	akurtakov: I'm going to dive deeper into what i've done with motion drags and see ifi can get this working with styledtext using instanceOf
Apr 06 14:29:53 <akurtakov>	ipun: good
Apr 06 14:30:05 <ipun>	i much prefer the mouse movement stuff anyways
Apr 06 14:30:25 <lufimtse>	ipun, sendDragEvent (gdkEvent.button, gdkEvent.state, (int) gdkEvent.x, (int) gdkEvent.y, false); << delay execution of that guy.
Apr 06 14:30:29 <lufimtse>	basically.
Apr 06 14:30:49 <ipun>	lufimtse: i figured you were talking about that
Apr 06 14:30:53 <ipun>	ill work something around it now
Apr 06 14:30:55 <akurtakov>	only thing I prefer is the working one :)
Apr 06 14:31:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, he he :-)
Apr 06 15:01:06 <ipun>	can you allow  (IS_GTK) additions to styledText?
Apr 06 15:01:10 <ipun>	if it all works that is
Apr 06 15:01:20 <ipun>	akurtakov: 
Apr 06 15:02:29 <akurtakov>	ipun: wouldn't that change x11 behavior too ?
Apr 06 15:02:50 <ipun>	akurtakov: if i could figure out a solution to not change x11 behavior, could i do it?
Apr 06 15:03:36 <akurtakov>	in general I don't like the idea but if there is no other way and you can make it to not change x11 we can speak about it
Apr 06 15:03:46 <akurtakov>	but note that I'll question it heavily
Apr 06 15:03:59 <ipun>	okay sounds good

Apr 12 12:11:30 <ipun>	akurtakov: regarding the GtkText fix, I don't seem to be running into the crash on X11
Apr 12 12:11:39 <ipun>	are you doing a Text -> label transfer on DnDExample?
Apr 12 12:16:40 <akurtakov>	ipun: yes
Apr 12 12:16:58 <akurtakov>	ipun: I make it crash one out of 3 tries
Apr 12 12:17:53 <ipun>	wierd... I cant seem to do it
Apr 12 12:18:11 <ipun>	let me check out my logic again and maybe it screwed up the x11 passages
Apr 12 12:18:22 <akurtakov>	do you use this patch on top of your queue patch or on top of master ?
Apr 12 12:29:32 <ipun>	akurtakov: the patch was only off of master
Apr 12 12:29:50 <ipun>	are you doing it off of my queue patch as well?
Apr 12 12:33:41 <akurtakov>	yes
Apr 12 12:40:09 <ipun>	hmm okay ill play around with that as well then
Apr 12 12:49:55 <ipun>	i havent been able to replicate the crash but I do notice it being slower. Ill see what i can do
Apr 12 12:50:41 <ipun>	also seems to be completely broken in Wayland on text
Apr 12 13:00:05 <ipun>	could you try with the latest patch when you have time?
Apr 13 09:36:09 <ipun>	akurtakov: did you get a chance to see if https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94861 works?
Apr 13 09:36:18 <akurtakov>	doing it now
Apr 13 09:36:22 <ipun>	kk thanks
Apr 13 09:38:53 <akurtakov>	ipun: sorry , happens again
Apr 13 09:39:08 <akurtakov>	ipun: double click to select a word
Apr 13 09:39:11 <akurtakov>	dnd - works
Apr 13 09:39:23 <akurtakov>	repeat with another word - crash
Apr 13 09:39:34 <ipun>	ah i can reproduce it now
Apr 13 09:39:35 <ipun>	thank you
Apr 13 09:40:04 <akurtakov>	ipun: np, sorry if I wasn't clear the first time :)
Apr 13 09:40:44 <ipun>	akurtakov: its okay. With that I should be able to get to the bottom of this. My fix inherinently shouldnt cause any harm to x11 but it is, so this is important
Apr 13 09:42:04 <ipun>	okay the problem actually started with 510446, not 515035
Apr 13 09:42:32 <akurtakov>	?
Apr 13 09:46:10 <akurtakov>	I have to run now, happy easter :)
Apr 13 09:46:12 <ipun>	akurtakov: actually i lied
Apr 13 09:46:16 <ipun>	its not working on master
Apr 13 09:46:29 <ipun>	anyways ill figure it out :)

Apr 19 10:27:06 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ipun: if Ian is not busy with dnd stuff 
Apr 19 10:27:17 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Apr 19 10:27:19 <lufimtse>	hey
Apr 19 10:27:20 <lufimtse>	sup
Apr 19 10:27:27 <akurtakov>	let him move to the launchbar
Apr 19 10:27:32 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 19 10:27:35 <lufimtse>	bt
Apr 19 10:27:36 <lufimtse>	btw
Apr 19 10:27:43 <lufimtse>	can I get you to test a patch briefly
Apr 19 10:27:50 <akurtakov>	sure
Apr 19 10:28:07 <lufimtse>	Can you checkout and see if DnD works on your machine with this guy:
Apr 19 10:28:07 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95207/
Apr 19 10:28:13 <lufimtse>	It's based on SWT code that's 1 year old
Apr 19 10:28:18 <lufimtse>	so eclipse is buggy on it
Apr 19 10:28:29 <lufimtse>	but i just want to know if dnd works on your machine 
Apr 19 10:28:32 <lufimtse>	with that guy
Apr 19 10:28:36 <lufimtse>	tests:
Apr 19 10:28:44 <lufimtse>	1) StyledText, select text, drag
Apr 19 10:28:49 <lufimtse>	2) Package explorer
Apr 19 10:28:52 <lufimtse>	3) Staging area
Apr 19 10:28:56 <lufimtse>	3) DnD example
Apr 19 10:29:30 <lufimtse>	There's a quirck with StyledText DnD backwards selection & moving forward, but that's to be investigated later. For now Just want to know if basic dnd works.
Apr 19 10:30:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, let me know once done
Apr 19 10:47:10 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: DnD example seems to be fine
Apr 19 10:47:19 <akurtakov>	but eclipse is not starting for me
Apr 19 10:47:27 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, fair enough.
Apr 19 10:47:29 <lufimtse>	thank you.
Apr 19 10:47:44 <akurtakov>	it is just stuck on startup
Apr 19 11:57:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, yea, it's swt from a year ago. Maybe something's flaky.

Apr 19 12:58:21 <akurtakov>	guys I'll not find time to test the dnd this week
Apr 19 12:58:36 <akurtakov>	so please test/push yourself
Apr 19 13:00:08 <lufimtse>	ipun, akurtakov I encourage you guys to use the rebuild_swt_natives.sh script. Automates bunch of mundate tasks.
Apr 19 13:00:11 <lufimtse>	cd ~/bin/
Apr 19 13:00:16 <lufimtse>	ln -s ~/git/eclipse.platform.swt/bundles/org.eclipse.swt.tools/gtk/rebuild_swt_natives.sh swtb
Apr 19 13:00:24 <lufimtse>	ex ^ sim-link to it.
Apr 19 13:00:33 <lufimtse>	but note, I pushed a change just now so that it works when symlinked.
Apr 19 13:00:55 <lufimtse>	with above you can use via 'swtb'
Apr 19 13:01:19 <akurtakov>	will this create git noise ?
Apr 19 13:01:29 <akurtakov>	ah it's in bin sorry :)
Apr 19 13:01:49 <lufimtse>	this is for personal machine
Apr 19 13:02:21 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: well, there is mail from Martin asking for building swt natives on the mailing list
Apr 19 13:02:29 <akurtakov>	and getting confused with the wiki
Apr 19 13:02:32 <lufimtse>	let me check
Apr 19 13:06:14 <akurtakov>	looks like some cleanup in the content is needed
Apr 19 13:06:28 <akurtakov>	simpler howto maybe with less conditions :)
Apr 19 13:06:52 <akurtakov>	doh of the webpage I mean
Apr 19 13:07:59 <akurtakov>	sigh, we should really automate this inside eclipse
Apr 19 15:44:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ipun the DnD patch for manually managing outging SWT.Mouse* events is in. I.e, DnD in external widgets like styledText and CTabFolder should be functional.
Apr 19 15:45:04 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: cool, can't wait for tomorrow's build :)
Apr 19 15:52:18 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, btw do you know: If you have a 'dltk' buildCommand in the .project (I.e, shelled support), but you don't have shelled installed, are there any problems?
Apr 19 15:52:24 <lufimtse>	or is it silently installed?
Apr 19 15:52:46 <akurtakov>	it is silently ignored
Apr 19 15:52:48 <lufimtse>	yay
Apr 19 15:53:06 <akurtakov>	well, not build command but nature :)
Apr 19 15:54:20 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: there is wip to make marketplace client proposing to install though 
Apr 19 15:54:22 <akurtakov>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=513306
Apr 19 15:54:28 <akurtakov>	hopefully for oxygen
Apr 19 15:56:48 <lufimtse>	interesting
Apr 19 15:56:56 <lufimtse>	is it working atm? only with the ini setting?
Apr 19 15:57:06 <lufimtse>	lemme ping Mickael
Apr 19 15:58:08 *	akurtakov feels like walking organizer for the release train :)
Apr 19 16:00:38 <ipun>	akurtakov: where did you get any of the information about XSetInputFocus and such from SHell.java | line 573 and below?
Apr 19 16:00:55 <akurtakov>	ipun: let me open swt :)
Apr 19 16:01:17 *	akurtakov jumps from p2 to swt :)
Apr 19 16:02:01 <akurtakov>	ipun: the comment iis in the wrong place
Apr 19 16:02:13 <akurtakov>	it should be in the if X11 block
Apr 19 16:02:36 <akurtakov>	XSetInputFocus is xlib function so makes no sense outside of it
Apr 19 16:03:54 <ipun>	it is inside the x11 block im just curious how you got this information on how to handle override redirects
Apr 19 16:04:36 <akurtakov>	ipun: no idea 
Apr 19 16:04:53 <akurtakov>	this is from the very first kept commit in the repo :)
Apr 19 16:08:28 <ipun>	DANG
Apr 19 16:09:02 <akurtakov>	ipun: so gtk_window_present that is commented does nothing ?
Apr 19 16:09:10 <ipun>	does nothing
Apr 19 16:09:55 <akurtakov>	same for .gdk_window_focus (window, OS.GDK_CURRENT_TIME); ?
Apr 19 16:12:48 <ipun>	it was giving us that "gtk window_present_with_time" failure, and we tried using the proper time with it and it still failed
Apr 19 16:17:27 <akurtakov>	no idea :)
Apr 19 16:22:12 <ipun>	thanks anyways akurtakov :)
Apr 19 16:23:10 <akurtakov>	ipun: sorry for not helping much but simply it's impossible :)
Apr 19 16:24:45 <ipun>	its okay ill work at it

Apr 20 12:23:54 <lufimtse_>	bin
Apr 20 12:25:41 <akurtakov>	ipun: well, time for you to find it out on your own :)
Apr 20 12:25:46 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: bin ?
Apr 20 12:26:02 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, meh?

Apr 20 12:26:24 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, now that was suppose to go to a terminal
Apr 20 12:26:32 <lufimtse_>	I blame wayland
Apr 20 12:26:34 <lufimtse_>	X-D
Apr 20 13:13:58 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: do you mind closing https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=503431 
Apr 20 13:14:19 <akurtakov>	and opening a new one for your future work that doesn't target 4.7 
Apr 20 13:14:36 <akurtakov>	unless you plan some more work for it
Apr 20 14:02:25 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, done
Apr 20 14:02:36 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, ok
Apr 20 14:11:57 <ipun>	akurtakov: good news is i found the problem and i think i can fix it without GTK help :)
Apr 20 14:12:37 <ipun>	i got the focusing of it working now in wayland/X11, but theres just some x/y coordinates which are having issues at the moment
Apr 20 14:12:38 <akurtakov>	ipun: sounds good
