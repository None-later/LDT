Jul 27 11:58:48 *	Now talking on #swt
Jul 27 14:07:50 <ipun>	this may seem dumb, but is it correct to why my controlexample is running off of control.class now instead of .java?
Jul 27 14:08:40 <ipun>	my controlexample use to use the fontsize stuff that ive worked on, now its using control.class instead which i didnt touch
Jul 27 14:08:57 <ericwill>	the .class files are generated based on your changes from .java
Jul 27 14:09:11 <ericwill>	so unless you're changes aren't being reflected in the .class files you should be fine
Jul 27 14:09:19 <ericwill>	*your
Jul 27 14:13:57 <ipun>	hmm ok i might have to rebuild then thats probably the issue
Jul 27 14:14:52 <ericwill>	check the Java build path of your controlexample
Jul 27 14:15:01 <ericwill>	is the SWT project on the build path?
Jul 27 14:17:37 <ipun>	wierd enough i dont htink it is anymore...
Jul 27 15:03:46 <ipun>	ericwill looking at the commit, i copied over what its doing and its implementing it correctly with the font sizing
Jul 27 15:03:52 <ipun>	yet override_font() is still bugged
Jul 27 15:04:00 <ipun>	praying GTK looks at this seriously
Jul 27 15:04:11 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 27 15:04:17 <ericwill>	link to the commit?
Jul 27 15:07:49 <ipun>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=99c2423043f0c95a60093c618e00823e42e0ddfa
Jul 27 15:08:08 <ipun>	i implemented it the same way (to follow their way of doing it)
Jul 27 15:08:26 <ipun>	but i just realized this doesnt really have to do with override_font()
Jul 27 15:08:56 <ipun>	the guy just posted it since its just about how CSS is currently updated, but the override_font() i dont think has to do with this commit
Jul 27 15:08:59 <ericwill>	yeah so all that commit does is implement our thing
Jul 27 15:09:05 <ericwill>	i.e. convert from a pango unit to CSS
Jul 27 15:09:14 <ericwill>	which we already implemented :P
Jul 27 15:09:21 <ipun>	yup.
Jul 27 15:09:23 <ericwill>	would have been nice to know this earlier but oh well
Jul 27 15:09:47 <ipun>	sadly, i dont think we can use our code in the end =( since we're probably gonna have to use override_font() if its fixed
Jul 28 09:48:35 <ipun>	ericwill so far the comments on the GTK bug are not useful lol
Jul 28 09:48:49 <ericwill>	ipun yeah I just saw
Jul 28 09:48:59 <ipun>	not sure if Matt understands
Jul 28 09:49:18 <ericwill>	did Alex send you his Menu stuff?
Jul 28 09:50:30 <ipun>	no lemme msg him about that
Jul 28 09:52:52 <ericwill>	kk
Jul 28 10:09:11 <ipun>	should i move on to something else while i wait on GTK and alex?
Jul 28 10:09:25 <ipun>	cept my stack of things im dealing with is getting larger
Jul 28 10:13:18 <ericwill>	ipun I am going to ping them about the font thing
Jul 28 10:13:23 <ericwill>	since the comment wasn't really useful at all
Jul 28 10:14:40 <ipun>	yeah...
Jul 28 10:19:19 <ipun>	ericwill for the measured event loop bug, is this something that might be causing the signal call?
Jul 28 10:19:21 <ipun>	(GtkCellAllocCallback)get_cell_allocation
Jul 28 10:19:33 <ipun>	i forgot if we talked about that 
Jul 28 10:19:41 <ericwill>	ipun no, didn't see that
Jul 28 10:19:43 <ericwill>	looks likely
Jul 28 10:21:20 <ipun>	hmm okay. I looked deeper into that method but it doesnt have any explicit signals
Jul 28 10:21:47 <ericwill>	look in Display.initCallbacks() and see if there are any allocate callbacks
Jul 28 10:21:56 <ericwill>	also look in Tree and see there are any allocate callback methods
Jul 28 10:22:40 <ipun>	kk
Jul 28 10:32:42 <ericwill>	ipun send me the commit for that get_dpi thing
Jul 28 10:32:44 <ericwill>	from matt watson
Jul 28 10:33:04 <ipun>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=df08fc91bdc1d2e4c866122304fabe4dd298a7de
Jul 28 10:33:28 <ipun>	basically we need their override_font() to use that calculation
Jul 28 10:33:38 <ipun>	if we do that, it will fix it
Jul 28 10:33:49 <ericwill>	okay I think we are making progress
Jul 28 11:58:36 <ipun>	dispaly.initCallback has some callbacks like size_allocate
Jul 28 11:58:55 <ipun>	thats the only one though
Jul 28 12:02:05 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 28 12:04:23 <ipun>	ericwill: patch went out okay?
Jul 28 12:04:27 <ipun>	ill comment on the bug then
Jul 28 12:04:43 <ericwill>	ipun just commented lol, no need
Jul 28 12:04:46 <ipun>	okay
Jul 28 12:04:50 <ericwill>	we have a patch but I'm just waiting for him to commit it
Jul 28 12:05:37 <ipun>	how about on bugzilla?
Jul 28 12:08:39 <ericwill>	wait for the GTK bug to get fixed and then we can mark the Eclipse bug as fixed and link the commit
Jul 28 12:10:37 <ipun>	kk
Jul 28 13:57:25 <ericwill>	so that font bug is fixed and merged in GTK now
Jul 28 13:57:26 <ericwill>	all good
Jul 28 14:39:07 <ericwill>	ipun if you are ever bored/want something you don't have to think a lot about, make a bugzilla filter for all open SWT bugs and go through them
Jul 28 14:39:17 <ericwill>	close the ones which aren't relevant/can't reproduce
Jul 28 14:39:21 <ericwill>	to keep the BZ tidy
Jul 28 14:39:26 <ipun>	oaky
Jul 28 14:39:30 <ipun>	okay*
Jul 28 14:48:21 <ipun>	ericwill doesnt look like nulling the proc actually turns it off
Jul 28 14:57:22 <ericwill>	ipun hmm
Jul 28 14:57:30 <ericwill>	is there a method somewhere that destroys them or something?
Jul 28 15:05:01 <ipun>	ericwill theres a method called setEnabled from callback class, but i tried it and it doesnt seem to work
Jul 28 15:05:17 <ipun>	... wat
Jul 28 15:05:19 <ipun>	wait*
Jul 28 15:06:21 <ipun>	hahahaahah
Jul 28 15:06:26 <ipun>	it works
Jul 28 15:06:30 <ericwill>	okay :P
Jul 28 15:06:47 <ipun>	i just had to move the reenabling of it lower
Jul 28 15:06:53 <ipun>	lemme test around with it and we're good
Jul 28 15:57:16 <ipun>	hey lufimtse im still having issues compiling gtk for some reason with jhbuild... besides cancelling it and rebuilding again, did you find any other solution>
Jul 28 15:57:34 <lufimtse>	hey
Jul 28 16:18:48 <lufimtse>	ipun, what was the exact command we used again?
Jul 28 16:19:01 <lufimtse>	jhbuild buildone --force gtk+ ?
Jul 28 16:22:01 <ipun>	yeah thats it
Jul 28 16:25:09 <ericwill>	ipun please post on the platform-ui-dev mailing list and ask someone to review this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77096/
Jul 28 16:25:33 <ericwill>	ipun also take a look at this guy: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=493357
Jul 28 16:27:31 <ericwill>	I started work on that but I won't be able to finish it in time before I leave
Jul 28 16:27:55 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill I've updated the wiki: https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT/Devel/Gtk/jhbuild#Building_different_versions_of_gtk_.28or_compiling_your_changes.29
Jul 28 16:28:10 <lufimtse>	What you want is: 
Jul 28 16:28:10 <lufimtse>	 jhbuild buildone --force --no-network --distclean gtk+
Jul 28 16:28:25 <lufimtse>	the --distclean is especially needed if you go back to an older gtk version. 
Jul 28 16:28:45 <ipun>	it looks like someone broke a junit case in master
Jul 28 16:29:01 <lufimtse>	ipun, which one?
Jul 28 16:29:09 <ipun>	test_getPrinterList
Jul 28 16:29:20 <ipun>	unless its local
Jul 28 16:29:42 <lufimtse>	doesn't work on my system if I have a printer
Jul 28 16:29:53 <lufimtse>	stopped working somewhere in Gtk3.18
Jul 28 16:30:03 <ipun>	oh i see
Jul 28 16:30:04 <lufimtse>	I've been meaning to file a bug for it
Jul 28 16:30:11 <lufimtse>	maybe something for you to work on. 
Jul 28 16:30:13 <ipun>	ill ignore it for now
Jul 28 16:30:21 <lufimtse>	do you have a printer on your system?
Jul 28 16:30:34 <ipun>	ya
Jul 28 16:30:41 <ipun>	i just added it like a week ago though
Jul 28 16:33:45 <lufimtse>	that's probably why the jUnit fails
Jul 28 16:33:52 <lufimtse>	if you have time, feel free to investigate sometime
Jul 28 16:33:59 <lufimtse>	would be useful to have it fixed.
Jul 28 16:34:10 <lufimtse>	afaik it doesn't reproduce with gtk3.16 and before
Jul 28 16:34:13 <lufimtse>	so might be gtk bug.

Jul 29 11:38:32 <ipun>	lufimtse looks like the printerlist bug in our test case is really broken logic, techincally none of it shouldve passed
Jul 29 11:39:05 <lufimtse>	lol
Jul 29 15:28:33 <ipun>	ericwill should I be replacing all the gtk calls to that function to my private one? Im not sure if this is what we should do
Jul 29 15:28:58 <ericwill>	your private method is just a wrapper
Jul 29 15:29:01 <ericwill>	for the GTK call
Jul 29 15:29:07 <ericwill>	with the callback.setEnabled() in it
Jul 29 15:32:04 <ipun>	yeah i know, im just curious if its necessary to do that for every call that uses that function
Jul 29 15:32:19 <ericwill>	we should
Jul 29 15:32:39 <ericwill>	because if someone wants to use one of those methods in a measure event, the same bug will come up
Jul 29 15:33:48 <ipun>	oaky sounds good
Jul 29 15:34:18 <ipun>	i might have to implement it in Control and Widget as well, since Tree is a subclass of Control but Treeitem is a widget subclass
Jul 29 15:35:39 <ericwill>	ipun nah just do it in Control then
Jul 29 15:35:45 <ericwill>	sorry, widget
Jul 29 15:35:50 <ericwill>	all Controls are widgets
Jul 29 15:38:16 <ipun>	ah your right sorry i misread it 
Jul 29 16:29:25 <ipun>	ericwill how do you generate a new changeset number again? I tried pushing my changes but the changeset was closed already.
Jul 29 16:29:41 <ericwill>	before amending the commit, click the gerrit button in egit
Jul 29 16:29:50 <ericwill>	should give you something with multiple zeros
Jul 29 16:29:57 <ericwill>	copy and paste that and use it for your new change
Jul 29 16:32:15 <ipun>	nice thanks!

Aug 03 16:34:42 <ericwill>	check preferences
Aug 04 11:01:26 <ipun>	ericwill: for the setVisible bug you assigned me, seems like a GTK error. Documentation of gtk_window_get_position() says its really unaccurate and that its not 100% reliable
Aug 04 11:01:53 <ericwill>	ipun then close it as such with a link to the documentation

Aug 11 17:07:49 <ipun>	kk
Aug 12 09:14:43 <ericwill>	lufimtse hey...when you're around I have a question
Aug 12 09:58:47 <lufimtse>	ericwill, hullo
Aug 12 09:59:13 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I miss your company already X-D
Aug 12 09:59:24 <lufimtse>	wanted to complain about my landlady to you.
Aug 12 09:59:42 <ericwill>	haha yeah, working from home is kinda lonely
Aug 12 09:59:44 <ericwill>	the sleep is nice though
Aug 12 09:59:52 <ericwill>	what did your landlady do?
Aug 12 10:00:02 <lufimtse>	It's like when I was suggesting to you to use certain tools (emacs), she is suggesting me to organise my room in a certain way. Man she's driving me mad ^____^.
Aug 12 10:00:14 <lufimtse>	Boy I have learned
Aug 12 10:00:47 <ericwill>	lol, that seems like an odd thing for a landlady to be involved in -.-
Aug 12 10:04:19 <ericwill>	btw lufimtse I tested your sysdeps script...works very well
Aug 12 10:04:55 <ericwill>	might be useful to note that after using sysdeps, you can only use the build.sh once you've renamed your .classpath_gtk in the SWT git repo
Aug 12 10:05:39 <lufimtse>	I was thinking of fixing that up... hmmm
Aug 12 10:05:52 <lufimtse>	I could add a check?
Aug 12 10:06:35 <lufimtse>	like ask user "no .classpath found, would you like to copy .classpath_gtk to .classpath? [y/n]"
Aug 12 10:06:37 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Aug 12 10:08:06 <xipun>	wait lufimtse why is your landlady giving you pointers about your room
Aug 12 10:09:20 <lufimtse>	Some of the furniture is hers
Aug 12 10:09:41 <lufimtse>	We have a friendly relationship, but her micro-management is somewhat intense..
Aug 12 10:09:52 <lufimtse>	also I'm not that clean, she is a obsessive about cleaning
Aug 12 10:10:04 <lufimtse>	I have stuff lying around my room, kinda like on my desk.
Aug 12 10:10:18 <lufimtse>	she's like, "you should put the things you don't use into the garage"
Aug 12 10:10:25 <lufimtse>	me like "i'm quite happy with my room the way it is"
Aug 12 10:10:49 <lufimtse>	tensions eventually escalate, 
Aug 12 10:11:08 <lufimtse>	grr
Aug 12 10:11:14 <lufimtse>	need to let off some steam lol ^_^
Aug 12 10:11:32 <ericwill>	oh lols
Aug 12 10:11:38 <ericwill>	yeah that would be annoying
Aug 12 10:12:48 <ericwill>	lufimtse re: the sysdeps thing, you could check and print something, but offering to copy it makes the assumption that you've checked out the git repo already
Aug 12 10:12:55 <ericwill>	which is fine by me actually
Aug 12 10:13:41 <lufimtse>	good idea. 
Aug 12 10:13:56 <lufimtse>	very unintrusive
Aug 12 10:14:58 <ericwill>	I like the script, saved me a lot of time
Aug 12 10:17:08 <ericwill>	also lufimtse, did you by any chance document that bit about the "fetch from gerrit" menu missing? I ran into the same issue on my machine at home, can't remember how you got it to work
Aug 12 10:43:56 <lufimtse>	humms
Aug 12 10:44:39 <lufimtse>	not in public wiki, but let me check my private wiki

Aug 12 10:55:01 <ericwill>	lufimtse okay will try it out, thanks
Aug 12 11:04:22 <ericwill>	lufimtse hmm so all I needed to do was select the http option with no username
Aug 12 11:04:27 <ericwill>	i.e.: http://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git
Aug 12 11:04:39 <lufimtse>	let me check
Aug 12 11:05:01 <lufimtse>	ssh://lufimtsev@git.eclipse.org:29418/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git
Aug 12 11:05:06 <lufimtse>	avoid the 'gitroot' one
Aug 12 11:05:24 <lufimtse>	I also copied SSH keys to the right places
Aug 12 11:05:42 <lufimtse>	I keep my SSH key in my google drive and then copy it to my machine when needed
Aug 12 11:05:50 <lufimtse>	or generate new key and put to eclipse org
Aug 12 11:06:06 <ericwill>	ah okay
Aug 12 11:06:32 <lufimtse>	http://storage8.static.itmages.com/i/16/0812/h_1471014423_5798266_dffa5947e3.png
Aug 12 11:06:34 <lufimtse>	when I push
Aug 12 11:06:45 <lufimtse>	for review
Aug 12 11:07:01 <lufimtse>	you may have to tinker with .git/config
Aug 12 11:07:05 <lufimtse>	and stuff gerrit in there
Aug 12 11:07:13 <lufimtse>	do you need my copy of the .git/config?
Aug 12 11:07:25 <ericwill>	no no
Aug 12 11:07:31 <ericwill>	I copied the one from my work machine, seems to work
Aug 12 11:08:10 <ericwill>	also the ssh works for me now too, just had to remove gitroot from the URI
Aug 12 11:08:12 <ericwill>	all good
Aug 12 11:22:19 <lufimtse>	kewl
Aug 12 11:22:34 <lufimtse>	I should document it
Aug 12 11:22:48 <lufimtse>	originally you helped me with finding that one had to get rid of 'gitroot',
Aug 12 11:23:49 <ericwill>	yup
Aug 12 11:23:56 <ericwill>	and now I had totally forgotten it
Aug 12 11:24:04 <ericwill>	this is why it's important to document :P
Aug 12 11:38:45 <ericwill>	ipun is this for review? https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78969/
Aug 12 11:39:18 <ipun>	oh woops sorry i forgot to tag the WIP on it
Aug 12 11:39:23 <ipun>	im just running the tests on it now
Aug 12 11:39:26 <ericwill>	kk
Aug 12 11:40:16 <lufimtse>	After I push stage 1 of the webkit business, I'll tryina invest sometime into more documentation and blogging
Aug 12 11:40:36 <lufimtse>	I've been somewhat happy with my zim and been lazy about putting things into public wiki
Aug 12 11:40:47 <lufimtse>	:-3
Aug 12 11:40:54 <lufimtse>	I'm so bad.
Aug 12 11:42:51 <ipun>	lufimtse im having issues compiling eclipse after running your build script =(
Aug 12 11:43:04 <lufimtse>	X-D
Aug 12 11:43:08 <lufimtse>	let's investigate
Aug 12 11:43:59 <ericwill>	ipun are you by any chance getting: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.OS.setenv([B[BI)I
Aug 12 11:48:41 <ericwill>	lufimtse it looks like your commit yesterday to the build script broke something
Aug 12 11:48:46 <ericwill>	reverting it fixes it for me
Aug 12 11:58:47 <lufimtse>	it's the commit after my commit
Aug 12 11:58:51 <lufimtse>	sravan's changes to c.c
Aug 12 11:58:55 <lufimtse>	ericwill, 
Aug 12 11:58:59 <lufimtse>	Investigating
Aug 12 11:59:11 <lufimtse>	BUT FIRST
Aug 12 11:59:12 <ericwill>	hmm
Aug 12 11:59:13 <lufimtse>	Tea.
Aug 12 11:59:50 <ericwill>	okay makes sense actually
Aug 12 12:03:35 <lufimtse>	of course,
Aug 12 12:03:45 <lufimtse>	drinking tea before tacking a problem always makes sense.
Aug 12 12:04:31 <ericwill>	:D
Aug 12 12:07:41 <ipun>	well my patch works if rebased on a previous commit
Aug 12 12:07:48 <ipun>	tried on all versions, it looks good now
Aug 12 12:08:32 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill I'm investigating the setenv business, will post in bug or on dev-list
Aug 12 12:08:46 <ericwill>	kk
Aug 12 12:51:11 <lufimtse>	ericwill|lunch, ipun I figured it out. the first static initializer in OS.java calls OS.setenv(..) before the library is loaded.
Aug 12 13:25:54 <ericwill>	oh lord
Aug 12 13:25:58 <ericwill>	rebooted over lunch
Aug 12 13:26:05 <ericwill>	forgot I had removed my boot partition
Aug 12 13:26:07 <ericwill>	had to re-install grub
Aug 12 13:30:57 <ipun>	did you let svan know lufimtse ?
Aug 12 13:36:57 <ipun>	:qq
Aug 12 13:37:02 <ipun>	woops sorry
Aug 12 13:44:56 <lufimtse>	ipun, I posted in the bug, investigating fix.
Aug 12 14:51:27 <ericwill>	lufimtse are you okay with me merging that sysdeps thing?
Aug 12 15:03:32 <lufimtse>	sec
Aug 12 15:03:39 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I'm still adding the .class thing check
Aug 12 15:03:43 <lufimtse>	I wrote it, just need to push it.
Aug 12 15:03:56 <lufimtse>	twiddling with hi-dpi unsat.link error.
Aug 12 15:03:59 <lufimtse>	atm
Aug 12 15:04:06 <ericwill>	yeah that error is annoying
Aug 12 15:04:11 <ericwill>	I just reverted it locally
Aug 12 15:34:02 <lufimtse>	ericwill, ipun, I submitted a patch, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78989/
Aug 12 15:34:15 <lufimtse>	I'm awaiting Niraj or Sravan to review and push to master.
Aug 12 15:34:45 <ericwill>	lufimtse saw it, looks good from my end
Aug 12 15:34:52 <ericwill>	sadly they are in India and probably in bed already
Aug 12 15:34:56 <ericwill>	so we don't get a fix till Monday
Aug 12 15:35:00 <lufimtse>	If they haven't done it by monday evening, I'll just push it myself...

Aug 17 10:34:52 <ipun>	for bug 182598, Im wondering if I should close it as unfixed or not. This has to do with how SWT is handling listeners; basically the item is destroyed before a method in the callback is ran
Aug 17 10:35:06 <ipun>	im not entirely sure how to fix this
Aug 17 10:36:50 <ericwill>	ipun the item is destroyed before the callback?
Aug 17 10:36:58 <ipun>	yeah
Aug 17 10:37:52 <ipun>	it crashes at tree.setItemCount(1)
Aug 17 10:38:08 <ipun>	its during the second event trigger 
Aug 17 10:38:46 <ericwill>	where in setItemCount does it crash?
Aug 17 10:40:26 <ipun>	i cant actually tell. It offsets the process so its done later
Aug 17 10:40:59 <ipun>	running a debug through the method is fine, but once it leaves and trys to finish the rest of the app, it crashes
Aug 17 10:41:11 <ipun>	i also noticed changed it to setItemCount(2) works fine

Aug 29 11:55:41 <lufimtse>	ok
Aug 29 11:55:44 <lufimtse>	test hard my friend.

Aug 30 14:58:25 <ipun>	lufimtse hey i think i found the commit causing it through git blame, how do i switch to that exact commit again?
Aug 30 14:58:35 <ipun>	or is there a way to search git history?

Aug 30 15:12:29 <ipun>	yeah thats it
Aug 30 15:12:29 <lufimtse>	yea, seems like it.
Aug 30 15:12:33 <lufimtse>	I'm reading up on it.
Aug 30 15:16:23 <ipun>	sadly not very useful considering it has no commit message...
Aug 30 15:31:15 <lufimtse>	LD_LIBRARY_PATH/home/lufimtse/git/swt_dev_tools/gtk_builds/3.06
Aug 30 15:31:26 <lufimtse>	except lufimtse -> ipun
Aug 30 16:12:28 <lufimtse>	ipun, btw, to copy workspace across, I used:
Aug 30 16:12:29 <lufimtse>	rsync -avzh /home/lufimtse/workspace_neon/ ~/workspace
Aug 30 16:12:32 <lufimtse>	from host to vm
Aug 30 16:12:38 <lufimtse>	as per
Aug 30 16:12:39 <lufimtse>	http://www.tecmint.com/rsync-local-remote-file-synchronization-commands/
Aug 30 16:12:45 <lufimtse>	That way the vm uses a copy of the workspace
Aug 30 16:12:56 <lufimtse>	I just re-run the command to get a fresh copy of the workspace
Aug 30 16:13:15 <lufimtse>	the nice thing is that it just sync the changes, so it's fast if you have a big workspace. (mine is like 1.5 gb).
Aug 30 16:18:13 <ipun>	nice thanks! ive just basically copied over another workspace and renamed it somethjing else, but this definitely would be useful for syncing

Sep 01 10:54:24 <ericwill>	that comment is so useful
Sep 01 10:54:47 <ericwill>	if that ends up being true we should replace all instances of gdk_screen_get_monitor_at_window() with that
Sep 01 10:55:33 <ericwill>	that would fix https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=494771 as well
Sep 01 10:58:10 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 01 10:58:19 <lufimtse>	ipun, sup
Sep 01 10:58:48 <lufimtse>	ipun, change bug id in title, make a new change id
Sep 01 10:58:59 <lufimtse>	that should create new gerrit review.
Sep 01 11:17:19 <ipun>	ericwill thanks for the comment, that does indeed get the correct monitor
Sep 01 11:17:29 <ipun>	however, its still painting in the wrong place
Sep 01 11:17:33 <ipun>	working on finding why its doing that
Sep 01 11:18:00 <ericwill>	ipun look at ToolTip.drawTooltip()
Sep 01 11:38:30 <ipun>	have any of you guys had issues with eclipse causing your whole computer to slow down for like 2 minutes and crash
Sep 01 11:38:33 <ipun>	ive had that happen once in a while
Sep 01 11:41:32 <ericwill>	hmm
Sep 01 11:41:34 <ericwill>	nope
Sep 01 11:58:52 <ipun>	ericwill so i fixed it, but because of nonexistant documentation, i have no idea how
Sep 01 11:59:52 <ipun>	in configure () theres soooo many numbers that have no meaning
Sep 01 12:09:36 <ericwill>	ipun throw the patch onto gerrit I'll take a look
Sep 01 12:10:00 <ericwill>	oh god, looking at tooltip.configure()...
Sep 01 12:10:07 <ericwill>	what is happening here
Sep 01 12:10:38 <ericwill>	I don't think these numbers affect us, just the monitor bits
Sep 01 12:18:37 <ipun>	ericwill k i found out whats going on
Sep 01 12:18:42 <ipun>	its actually f rom configure()
Sep 01 12:18:46 <ipun>	i fixed it from there
Sep 01 12:18:56 <ipun>	i have an idea on how to fix, just needs some time

Sep 01 15:25:44 <ipun>	its annoying because GTK sees a certain monitor as 1 but its not primary in my setup
Sep 01 15:25:54 <ipun>	like, from the OS you can switch it
Sep 01 15:26:07 <ipun>	so now im trying to figure out how to get it working correctly
Sep 01 15:26:30 <ericwill>	yeah it's tricky

Sep 07 17:25:45 <lufimtse>	ipun, not afaik, but he seems to be on mattermost # Platform
Sep 08 12:13:23 <ipun>	lufimtse could you help me set up my gerrit for another repo im working on?
Sep 08 12:13:28 <ipun>	i forggot some of the steps
Sep 08 12:13:33 <lufimtse>	ipun, hey
Sep 08 12:13:34 <lufimtse>	sure
Sep 08 12:13:34 <lufimtse>	sec
Sep 08 12:25:01 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun looks like the SWT JUnit tests are broken on GTK3 for master
Sep 08 12:25:05 <ericwill>	can any of you confirm
Sep 08 12:27:21 <ericwill>	oh wait nvm
Sep 08 12:27:23 <ericwill>	I got it to work
Sep 08 12:27:26 <ericwill>	disregard :)
Sep 08 13:30:41 <lufimtse>	ericwill, :-3
Sep 08 13:31:15 <lufimtse>	I spoke with Stefan Xenos on Mattermost today, it was nice to actually be able to reach out and chat to other swt developers
Sep 08 13:31:31 <lufimtse>	too bad people don't seem to gravitate thowards freenode#swt
Sep 08 13:31:32 <lufimtse>	oh well.
Sep 08 13:41:54 <ericwill>	lufimtse yeah I'm going to download it today and check it out
Sep 08 14:08:51 <lufimtse>	kewl
Sep 08 14:09:22 <ipun>	whats next?
Sep 08 14:12:02 <ericwill>	ipun I sent you some emails
Sep 08 14:12:28 <ipun>	ericwill i gottem thanks! sorry i was asking "whats next" to leo
Sep 08 14:12:33 <ipun>	lufimtse^
Sep 08 14:12:37 <ericwill>	ipun ah lol, np
Sep 08 14:12:38 <ipun>	my eclipse has ded
Sep 08 14:22:28 <lufimtse>	@ipun, Guide on how to setup Eclipse to run nightly: https://coffeeorientedprogramming.com/2016/09/08/running-nightly-eclipse-for-the-impatient/
Sep 08 14:29:26 <ipun>	thank you!
Sep 08 14:31:58 <ericwill>	that's it for me today, talk to you guys later
Sep 08 14:32:03 <lufimtse>	ericwill, kk
Sep 08 14:32:07 <lufimtse>	have nice 1
Sep 08 14:32:14 <lufimtse>	ipun, lemme know if you get stuck somewhere
Sep 08 14:32:20 <ericwill>	lufimtse you too :)
Sep 08 14:32:32 <lufimtse>	you will need to download all the relevant 'mylyn' plugins (with gerrit integration)
Sep 08 14:32:55 <lufimtse>	Setting up a new workspace might not be a bad idea, to have a fresh start.
Sep 08 14:33:09 <lufimtse>	But the existing one should theoretically get the job done as well.
Sep 08 14:33:56 <ipun>	hokay
Sep 08 14:39:45 <ipun>	lufimtse which stuff from mylyn do i need?
Sep 08 14:40:01 <ipun>	klike
Sep 08 14:40:05 <ipun>	whats "relevent"
Sep 08 14:44:10 <ipun>	also im still having that same issue. I know eric and I figured it out a while back it had to do with some config file
Sep 08 15:14:55 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 08 15:15:06 <lufimtse>	lemme checks.
Sep 09 10:04:27 <ericwill>	morning ipun 
Sep 09 10:04:37 <ipun>	hello ericwill
Sep 09 10:05:34 <ericwill>	hello, looks like the focus patch got reverted
Sep 09 10:05:39 *	ericwill sighs
Sep 09 10:05:46 <ericwill>	you win some you lose some haha
Sep 09 10:06:06 <ipun>	i know =(
Sep 09 10:06:52 <ericwill>	looks like we need to start running the JFace tests at least once on patches
Sep 09 10:06:57 <ericwill>	which is annoying but necessary I suppose
Sep 09 10:07:11 <ipun>	lufimtse, would you be able to add that to your test script?
Sep 09 10:07:53 <ericwill>	I don't think so
Sep 09 10:08:01 <ericwill>	the test script is located in the SWT repo
Sep 09 10:08:35 <ericwill>	though maybe an optional "run jface tests too" flag/option could be added
Sep 09 10:13:54 <ipun>	yeah true
Sep 09 10:14:10 <ipun>	lemme try to fix the test suite stuff
Sep 09 10:14:28 <ericwill>	np
Sep 09 10:14:48 <ericwill>	might be worth it to write a bunch of test cases and put them into the SWT test suite too
Sep 09 10:24:17 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill, it's potentially possible to add jface stuff to the script.
Sep 09 10:24:29 <lufimtse>	the only thing it would take much much longer to execute
Sep 09 10:24:47 <ipun>	set it as a flag lufimtse 
Sep 09 10:24:49 <ericwill>	^
Sep 09 10:24:56 <ericwill>	-J or something
Sep 09 10:25:03 <lufimtse>	unless I make it so that it only runs one gtk version for jFace, and many for gtk
Sep 09 10:25:09 <ipun>	considering that it needs to be run anyways, running the thing on a VM would be the best
Sep 09 10:25:36 <lufimtse>	or a selector, which versions to test with jface, which versions to test with swt
Sep 09 10:26:03 <lufimtse>	From technical side, can be done. 
Sep 09 10:26:04 <ericwill>	lufimtse a selector sounds good. By default you could have it run the JFace tests with the same GTK3 version as the build machine
Sep 09 10:26:09 <ericwill>	(3.10 I think)
Sep 09 10:26:39 <lufimtse>	another option is to figure out how to run maven from command line, 
Sep 09 10:26:51 <lufimtse>	then run gtk_version_test && maven on jface
Sep 09 10:27:02 <lufimtse>	maven does testing
Sep 09 10:27:19 <lufimtse>	we can then pre-load LD_LIBRARY_PATH before maven runs
Sep 09 10:47:28 <ipun>	also ericwill, it kinda coordinates with how you told me the focus fix could have a test suite on it
Sep 09 10:48:00 <ericwill>	ipun yeah, now you can do the fix and add the test suites at the same time :)
Sep 09 11:19:13 <lufimtse>	ericwill, How do I test the project in here? : https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497812
Sep 09 11:19:22 <lufimtse>	I open child eclipse, but can't find any extra views
Sep 09 11:19:51 <ericwill>	lufimtse are you sure the new child eclipse is running with that plugin enabled?
Sep 09 11:21:55 <lufimtse>	Oh, I think it has some dependencies
Sep 09 11:22:03 <lufimtse>	org.eclipse.e4.core.di
Sep 09 11:22:04 <lufimtse>	meh
Sep 09 11:22:14 <lufimtse>	did you have to import those?
Sep 09 11:24:03 <lufimtse>	hmm, can't get the thing to work. Hmmmz
Sep 09 11:24:10 <ericwill>	I didn't run that project
Sep 09 11:24:43 <ericwill>	oh wait
Sep 09 11:24:45 *	ericwill checks
Sep 09 11:26:03 <lufimtse>	ericwill, oh, never mind
Sep 09 11:26:08 <lufimtse>	It's an RCP application
Sep 09 11:26:19 <lufimtse>	I went to com.vogella.eclipse.dndcontrols.product
Sep 09 11:26:25 <lufimtse>	clicked on "Launch an Eclipse application", 
Sep 09 11:26:28 <lufimtse>	snippet fired up.
Sep 09 11:26:39 <ericwill>	yes I just discovered this also lol
Sep 09 11:28:02 <ericwill>	lufimtse is that thing related to tracker/parts business?
Sep 09 11:28:07 <ericwill>	because the fix for that bug got merged already
Sep 09 11:28:31 <lufimtse>	No, but the fix contains instanceof
Sep 09 11:28:33 <lufimtse>	which is evil
Sep 09 11:29:06 <ericwill>	yeah I saw that
Sep 09 11:29:12 <ericwill>	I think in this case it is necessary though
Sep 09 11:29:38 <ericwill>	and since the instanceof is checking for Composite in Composite.java, I'm okay with it
Sep 09 11:30:08 <lufimtse>	Well, I beg to differ :-)
Sep 09 11:30:16 <lufimtse>	I'll submit a followup patch.
Sep 09 11:30:23 <ericwill>	what are your concerns?
Sep 09 11:31:53 <lufimtse>	Well, 
Sep 09 11:32:00 <lufimtse>	I'll submit patch, you'll see.
Sep 09 11:32:17 <ericwill>	ok
Sep 09 11:43:58 <ericwill>	lufimtse ah good call
Sep 09 11:44:01 <ericwill>	that patch looks good to me
Sep 09 11:44:04 <ericwill>	shall I merge?
Sep 09 11:47:00 <lufimtse>	Let's wait a day.
Sep 09 11:47:07 <lufimtse>	Then merge tomorrow if no objections.
Sep 09 11:47:15 <lufimtse>	Just to allow people to see it.
Sep 09 11:47:24 <lufimtse>	I'll followup on the bug.
Sep 09 11:47:34 <ericwill>	tomorrow is saturday :P
Sep 09 11:47:39 <ericwill>	also Monday is the code freeze for M2
Sep 09 11:47:50 <ericwill>	so if you want to wait that's fine but it will have to wait till M3
Sep 09 11:48:04 <lufimtse>	oh
Sep 09 11:48:10 <lufimtse>	thanks for pointing it out.
Sep 09 11:48:15 <lufimtse>	Hmmmmzzz
Sep 09 11:48:20 <ericwill>	I'm fine with waiting
Sep 09 11:48:22 <ericwill>	it's not urgen
Sep 09 11:48:25 <ericwill>	*urgent
Sep 09 11:48:35 <lufimtse>	Let's merge at 5pm today :-)
Sep 09 11:48:51 <ericwill>	okay you do it, I won't be on
Sep 09 11:49:03 <lufimtse>	ok, if you could +1 it...
Sep 09 11:49:06 <lufimtse>	that'd be great.
Sep 09 11:49:25 <lufimtse>	thanks for being on IRC.
Sep 09 11:49:29 <lufimtse>	~good karma.
Sep 09 11:49:59 <ericwill>	np haha
Sep 09 11:50:05 <ericwill>	good catch btw
Sep 09 11:50:12 <ericwill>	didn't think of markLayout()
Sep 09 11:52:43 <ipun>	ericwill when i run the Test_org_eclipse_swt_custom_Ccombo test it seems to pass
Sep 09 11:52:54 <ipun>	i wonder whats causing the null exception...
Sep 09 11:53:11 <ericwill>	ipun do the JFace tests fail for you locally?
Sep 09 11:53:35 <ipun>	ericwill im actually trying to figure our why none of my Jface tests are running right now ==
Sep 09 11:53:44 <lufimtse>	X-D
Sep 09 11:53:54 <lufimtse>	lemme knows if u need helpz
Sep 09 11:54:03 <ipun>	kk
Sep 09 11:54:03 <ericwill>	I mean, you gotta crawl before you can walk :D
Sep 09 12:20:01 <ipun>	ericwill lufimtse am i the only one getting failures in Jface from master branches?
Sep 09 12:20:47 <ericwill>	last time I checked a few weeks back I got some
Sep 09 12:28:22 <ipun>	hmm okay
Sep 09 12:31:17 <ipun>	ericwill i ran the jface stuff with my focus bug, doesnt seem to be a jface error =S i wonder whats causing that null exception
Sep 09 12:33:24 <ericwill>	ask Alex or lufimtse if they can reproduce the bug locally
Sep 09 12:33:47 <lufimtse>	meh?
Sep 09 12:33:50 <lufimtse>	what goes on
Sep 09 12:34:05 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun is having trouble reproducing a test failure on his machine
Sep 09 12:34:23 <lufimtse>	ericwill, do you know how the javadoc thing is constructed? is it physically using a tooltop or some browser?
Sep 09 12:34:35 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's a Browser widget
Sep 09 12:34:46 <ericwill>	it has nothing to with ToolTip.java
Sep 09 12:34:47 <lufimtse>	Do you know where to find the source?
Sep 09 12:35:06 <ericwill>	yeah it's in the JDT source code
Sep 09 12:35:20 <lufimtse>	ericwill, if it is not a tooltip, what is it? Is it a content assistant?
Sep 09 12:35:37 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's a Browser that's been shrunk down and renders HTML
Sep 09 12:35:51 <ericwill>	if you run a child eclipse and set a breakpoint in Browser.java you can see the stack trace
Sep 09 12:36:07 <lufimtse>	ah
Sep 09 12:36:22 <lufimtse>	but from a theoretical point of view, how would we call that thing?
Sep 09 12:36:30 <lufimtse>	that 'construct'?
Sep 09 12:36:37 <lufimtse>	it's not a tooltip, it's a .......
Sep 09 12:36:39 <lufimtse>	fill in dots
Sep 09 12:36:41 <ericwill>	I would call it a popup browser
Sep 09 12:36:55 <ericwill>	just like the quick outline is popup tree, etc.
Sep 09 12:37:49 <lufimtse>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window ?
Sep 09 12:37:55 <lufimtse>	I wanna argue with Dani mergerd
Sep 09 12:38:09 <lufimtse>	Megert*
Sep 09 12:38:46 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's not even a modal window because it doesn't prevent you from clicking the main Eclipse window while it's open
Sep 09 12:39:01 <ericwill>	it's literally a small widget that pops up and is clickable, and disappears if you click outside of it
Sep 09 12:39:10 <ericwill>	calling it a tooltip is just wrong lol
Sep 09 12:39:23 <lufimtse>	yea, I'm looking for a name to call it, would you refer to it as a modal_window?
Sep 09 12:39:40 <ericwill>	no
Sep 09 12:39:46 <ericwill>	modal windows disable the parent window
Sep 09 12:39:58 <ericwill>	the javadoc tooltip doesn't disable the parent Eclipse window while it's open
Sep 09 12:40:15 <lufimtse>	I see
Sep 09 12:40:15 <lufimtse>	hmm
Sep 09 12:40:38 <ipun>	lufimtse ill ask you about the errors later
Sep 09 12:40:44 <ipun>	doesnt seem to be happening on my machine or my VM
Sep 09 12:43:44 <ericwill>	lufimtse I would just argue to him that it's simply a small widget
Sep 09 12:43:55 <ericwill>	and that because of that it should at the very least have COLOR_WIDGET_* colors
Sep 09 12:44:05 <ericwill>	since it doesn't have any of the properties of a tooltip like I mentioned
Sep 09 12:46:12 <lufimtse>	ericwill, what color should it have?
Sep 09 12:46:54 <ericwill>	lufimtse it should have the same colors as a normal browser widget IMO
Sep 09 12:47:00 <ericwill>	so look in ControlExample
Sep 09 12:47:02 <ericwill>	whatever that is
Sep 09 12:47:24 <ericwill>	I think it's COLOR_WIDGET_BACKGROUND for the controls and COLOR_LIST_BACKGROUND for the content rendering area
Sep 09 12:49:42 <ericwill>	anyways lufimtse I have to run, we'll chat more next week
Sep 09 12:49:45 <ericwill>	have a good weekend :)
Sep 09 12:49:55 <lufimtse>	ericwill, thank you for feedback, have a nice one.
Sep 09 12:50:05 <lufimtse>	looking forward to having u back in office.
Sep 09 12:50:21 <ericwill>	lufimtse I know, me too. IRC is tedious -.-

Sep 09 15:01:39 <ipun>	hey lufimtse so i cant replicate the issue with the focus fix
Sep 09 15:01:54 <ipun>	not sure why, apparently it was erroring on the nightly

Sep 12 16:22:22 <ipun>	lufimtse: i realize right now date time works in a really wierd way when you do on click changes (typing it in on your own). Do you remmber any bug IDs that you worked on relating to it?
Sep 12 16:23:49 <lufimtse>	hey

Sep 12 16:26:29 <lufimtse>	Anatoly started the port, I finished it off.
Sep 12 16:26:41 <lufimtse>	It was the first SWT thing I worked on.
Sep 12 16:26:48 <ipun>	ah i see thank you
Sep 12 16:45:44 <ipun>	also lufimtse, i looked into this bug: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=197690
Sep 12 16:46:03 <ipun>	if you did a lot of work on date time, this might be easier for you to fix without disrupting too much of your logic
Sep 12 16:47:47 <ipun>	did you happen to touch anything with onNumberKeyInput()?
Sep 13 10:08:39 <ericwill>	morning gentlemen
Sep 13 10:11:29 <ipun>	morning gentlemen
Sep 13 10:13:40 <lufimtse>	It would be a while before I would get to it. I first have to resolve some DnD issues, then the webkit thing, then the wayland port etc.. 
Sep 13 10:14:06 <lufimtse>	if you want to work on something else, feel free to assign it to platform-swt-inbox and someday I might get to it.
Sep 13 10:14:49 <ericwill>	what's this?
Sep 13 10:15:37 <ipun>	wrong convo?
Sep 13 10:16:30 <ericwill>	lufimtse ?

Sep 13 10:32:43 <ericwill>	ipun okay
Sep 13 10:32:55 <ericwill>	ipun can you also write a JUnit test case for this bug?
Sep 13 10:33:22 <ipun>	okay
Sep 13 10:33:49 <ericwill>	you can put it in a separate gerrit
Sep 13 10:33:58 <ipun>	kk, part of same bug ID?
Sep 13 10:35:18 <ericwill>	yup
Sep 13 11:33:05 <ericwill>	ipun I'll review your patches sometime this week
Sep 13 11:33:11 <ericwill>	we can't merge anything till M2 is released
Sep 13 11:33:30 <ericwill>	aka Friday
Sep 13 11:53:16 <ipun>	kewl
Sep 13 11:53:29 <ipun>	ericwill im going to work on a bit of dark theme bugs in the time being
Sep 13 11:55:42 <ericwill>	ipun yeah that sounds fine :)
Sep 13 15:24:14 <ipun>	lufimtse, for one of my bugs im working on, it turns out that setBackground() is taking priority over css
Sep 13 15:24:21 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 13 15:24:30 <lufimtse>	which bugz
Sep 13 15:24:37 <lufimtse>	I'm working on Color of javadoc hover
Sep 13 15:24:44 <ipun>	it seems that after "refreshing" it (clicking a different tab, selecting it and dselcting it, etc) it fixes it
Sep 13 15:24:55 <ipun>	is there a method in control that refreshes?
Sep 13 15:25:31 <lufimtse>	meh?
Sep 13 15:25:38 <lufimtse>	What bugs u working on
Sep 13 15:26:15 <ipun>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=483789
Sep 13 15:26:50 <ipun>	like, for example, if you click on something it highlights it, meaning it overrites the color with a "highlight color"
Sep 13 15:27:02 <ipun>	once you remove the highlight (deselect), it refreshes it
Sep 13 15:27:05 <ipun>	thast just one example
Sep 13 15:28:35 <lufimtse>	Do you get that behavoiur in pure swt?
Sep 13 15:28:42 <lufimtse>	it's possible that platform UI messes with colours
Sep 13 15:29:23 <ipun>	i havent played with that in SWT no
Sep 13 15:37:18 <ipun>	actaully i think i know the issue. It seems that its directly overriting the css since it uses setBackgroundColor
Sep 13 15:37:37 <ipun>	i wonder if theres a way to see if it is using a theme
Sep 13 15:38:18 <ipun>	ill ask
Sep 14 10:26:49 <ipun>	hey lufimtse, i had to do some cleaning on my workspace, and i forgot where in the run configuations do i set it so it runs my code for platform.ui
Sep 14 10:26:58 <ipun>	that is if i was running a child elcipse

Sep 15 11:11:16 <ericwill>	no, it's another Eclipse project
Sep 15 11:11:47 <ericwill>	you can find it at git.eclipse.org/c

Sep 16 11:31:10 <ipun>	hey
Sep 16 11:31:49 <ipun>	ericwill for isDisposed(), its annoying cause I cant reproduce it im not quite sure where its hitting this problem 
Sep 16 11:32:31 <ipun>	its defs going to be a item.isDisposed() condition, im just not exactly sure what exactly it should return if it is disposed
Sep 16 11:34:01 <ericwill>	ipun probably throw the error that the javadocs says
Sep 16 11:34:16 <ericwill>	or return the topItem at index 0
Sep 16 11:34:29 <ericwill>	you'll have to investigate and see
Sep 16 11:34:42 <ericwill>	btw I posted comments on that focus bug, other than those comments it's good to go

Sep 19 14:03:54 <lufimtse>	does git blame says so?
Sep 19 14:04:05 <lufimtse>	looks vaguley familiar
Sep 19 14:04:54 <ipun>	yeah it does, but its pretty nested so im not sure if you were the original writer of that method or if you did the refactoring

Sep 20 10:37:11 <ipun>	yup
Sep 20 10:43:17 <ericwill>	hello hello
Sep 20 11:10:50 <ericwill>	lufimtse hey, can you do a pull on SWT master and see if your build.sh script works?
Sep 20 11:15:00 <ericwill>	for some reason it gives me "cd: /home/ericwill/git/eclipse.platform.swt/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/bin/library"
Sep 20 11:35:40 <ericwill>	ah nvm I figured it out
Sep 20 11:35:47 <ericwill>	you have to remove a missing entry from the SWT build path
Sep 20 11:35:57 <ericwill>	one of Alex's fixes removed something
Sep 20 11:36:03 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun ^
Sep 20 11:36:29 <ipun>	thanks bro
Sep 20 12:33:51 <ipun>	so
Sep 20 12:33:53 <ipun>	lufimtse...
Sep 20 14:48:41 <ericwill>	lufimtse I wrote a python script that parses os_custom.h, fetches the list of deprecated functions in GTK, and compares to see if any dynamic functions are deprecated
Sep 20 14:48:52 <ericwill>	...there are quite a few it seems
Sep 20 14:49:13 <ericwill>	and we never see that they're deprecated since they never run through the compiler
Sep 20 14:55:52 <ipun>	 thanks ericwill

Oct 04 11:19:39 <ipun>	lufimtse ericwill, just relaying some stuff i dissected through debugging wayland. You can just set Enviro Variable of GDK_BACKEND to 'wayland' or 'X11' for any runtime configurations 
Oct 04 11:19:50 <ipun>	i would blog about it if i had a blog
Oct 04 11:20:19 <lufimtse>	hey
Oct 04 11:20:47 <lufimtse>	That's very useful to know
Oct 04 11:21:00 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun it would be cool if we could compile a list of GTK specific environment variables somewhere
Oct 04 11:21:04 <ericwill>	maybe the wiki?
Oct 04 11:21:16 <ipun>	yeah that be cool
Oct 04 11:21:19 <ipun>	cept thats the only one i know 
Oct 04 11:21:21 <ericwill>	things like USE_CAIRO, GDK_BACKEND, etc.
Oct 04 11:22:11 <lufimtse>	ipun, consider starting a blog (e.g wordpress?). Or if you want I could give you contributor rights to my blog on coffeeorientedprogramming
Oct 04 11:22:31 <ipun>	maybe ill do a wordpress.
Oct 04 11:23:06 <ipun>	i got to do a whole bunch a crap this week with FSSOS so I might as well do a wordpress as well 
Oct 04 11:24:13 <ericwill>	are both of you guys going to FSOSS or just you ipun 
Oct 04 11:24:29 <ipun>	im not sure about lufimtse but im going and presenting
Oct 04 11:24:52 <lufimtse>	when/where is FSOSS again?
Oct 04 11:24:58 <ipun>	York Uni
Oct 04 11:25:28 <ericwill>	lufimtse how did your CSC209 lecture go?
Oct 04 11:25:36 <lufimtse>	good good.  Lots of curious faces.
Oct 04 11:25:41 <lufimtse>	have one more next week.
Oct 04 11:25:49 <lufimtse>	first one was on open source
Oct 04 11:25:58 <lufimtse>	next one will be on Tools for C development.
Oct 04 11:26:36 <ericwill>	cool
Oct 04 11:27:16 <ipun>	nice i love visual studio
Oct 04 11:27:33 <ipun>	praise M$
Oct 04 11:28:14 <ericwill>	haha
Oct 04 11:28:29 <ericwill>	lufimtse signed my paperwork for full time btw :)
Oct 04 11:49:45 <lufimtse>	ericwill, Congrats :-D!
Oct 04 11:49:56 <lufimtse>	ipun, the CSC209 prof loves visual studi
Oct 04 11:50:04 <lufimtse>	she says it's the best ide for C development.
Oct 04 11:50:30 <lufimtse>	"and neccessary to succeed in life"
Oct 04 11:50:33 <lufimtse>	lol,
Oct 04 11:51:06 *	ericwill shakes head
Oct 04 11:51:10 <ipun>	does she even notepad
Oct 04 11:52:03 <ericwill>	lufimtse thanks, can't wait till May
Oct 04 11:52:07 <ericwill>	university is annoying :P
Oct 04 11:52:22 <lufimtse>	:-P
Oct 04 12:13:59 <ericwill>	lufimtse I triaged the SWT critical bugs down to 11 bugs
Oct 04 12:14:11 <lufimtse>	X-D, omg
Oct 04 12:14:12 <ericwill>	which is more manageable, the ones left are all reproducible
Oct 04 12:14:23 <lufimtse>	very nice
Oct 04 12:14:53 <lufimtse>	If you could send your status report before 11 am on wednesday, I'd mention that on your behalf.
Oct 04 12:15:09 <ericwill>	sure, will do :)
Oct 04 12:20:00 <ericwill>	time to run, see you guys later!

Oct 05 15:31:17 <ipun>	lufimtse, the performance issues shouldnt be caused by the theming, as my snippet (no theming engine) is doing the same thing
Oct 05 15:31:30 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 05 15:33:22 <ipun>	honestly very likely a listener issue
Oct 05 15:33:32 <ipun>	im going to try to diagnose it now
Oct 05 15:33:50 <ipun>	considering its 3pm in toronto, ill be here for awhile D=
Oct 05 16:04:11 <ipun>	also lufimtse i got my snippets running correctly, but even after putting my swt source in the build path its still using the onboard SWT
Oct 05 16:06:36 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 05 16:06:49 <lufimtse>	you need to change properties
Oct 05 16:06:52 <lufimtse>	in snippet project
Oct 05 16:06:57 <lufimtse>	to use SWT project
Oct 05 16:07:25 <lufimtse>	properties -> Java build path -> projects
Oct 05 16:07:31 <lufimtse>	add swt project in there.
Oct 05 16:09:45 <ipun>	i did, no change
Oct 05 16:10:26 <ipun>	ill try restarting it
Oct 05 16:10:33 <ipun>	did a clean -> build as well
Oct 05 16:12:42 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 05 16:13:04 <lufimtse>	maybe change the "order and Export"
Oct 05 16:13:08 <lufimtse>	move swt project up
Oct 05 16:13:32 <ipun>	did that already
Oct 05 16:13:47 <ipun>	when i debug a swt snippet which goes into SWT source, it says source not found
Oct 05 16:14:15 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 05 16:14:27 <lufimtse>	can you find some tool with which I can remote connect to your system?
Oct 05 16:14:42 <lufimtse>	I could try to remote-debug :--)
Oct 05 16:14:58 <ipun>	sure
Oct 05 16:15:03 <ipun>	lemme play with it a little long
Oct 05 16:15:05 <ipun>	longer*
Oct 05 16:15:10 <ipun>	worst case teamviewer?
Oct 05 16:20:47 <ipun>	lufimtse install teamviewer for me for now, i am too lazy to find a FSOSS option
Oct 05 16:28:58 <ipun>	yeah i still cant get it done. even under run configurations org.eclipse.swt is there for source/build path, yet it cant find anything during runtime
Oct 05 16:32:23 <ipun>	k nvm
Oct 05 17:07:27 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 05 17:08:19 <lufimtse>	Can you try to find something FSOSS? We could re-use it for other people also, (e.g Eric)... Maybe ask on red hat tech list about it?
Oct 05 17:08:28 <lufimtse>	Someone's bound to know some tool.
Oct 05 17:09:09 <lufimtse>	I'll be back tomorrow.

Oct 06 14:59:14 <ipun>	hey lufimtse good news, i thnk i found out whats causing the delay with ctab folders
Oct 06 14:59:32 <ipun>	which also might link to issues with ctabfolders in eclipse being put somewhere else when clicked
Oct 06 14:59:41 <lufimtse>	?
Oct 06 14:59:43 <ipun>	something with the listener Swt.DragDetect is busted
Oct 06 14:59:51 <lufimtse>	Could be
Oct 06 15:00:02 <lufimtse>	In one of my fixes, I implemented a timer that waits for a short time.
Oct 06 15:00:05 <ipun>	when i comment it out in CtabFolder, it runs normally
Oct 06 15:00:07 <lufimtse>	I wonder if that's to blame.
Oct 06 15:00:10 <ipun>	im not sure
Oct 06 15:00:14 <ipun>	whats the commit for that?
Oct 06 15:00:19 <lufimtse>	bleh, 
Oct 06 15:00:20 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 06 15:00:29 <lufimtse>	that was a while ago..
Oct 06 15:00:30 <ipun>	but the timer doesnt occur in X11, this issue only happens in wayland
Oct 06 15:00:36 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 06 15:00:44 <lufimtse>	I gotta checks. Hold on. 
Oct 06 15:02:26 <lufimtse>	git log show d75a51833886fedc47fd1992d6bcd02c341104d6
Oct 06 15:02:38 <lufimtse>	try to dissable that timer, see if that makes a difference
Oct 06 15:03:02 <lufimtse>	My fix for DnD is a bit of a hack. 
Oct 06 15:03:15 <lufimtse>	It was done in my early days :-)
Oct 06 15:03:51 <lufimtse>	I should ideally re-work that patch someday
Oct 06 15:06:57 <ipun>	'someday'
Oct 06 15:07:57 <ipun>	also there isnt any stable tiling manager for wayland yet
Oct 06 15:08:14 <ipun>	tried one called Sway, doesnt work very well so im not resorting to gnome for weayland testing
Oct 06 15:12:02 <ipun>	okay, so it looks like dragDetect gets triggered on CTabFolder only in wayland 
Oct 06 15:12:05 <ipun>	this is good, im getting somewhere
Oct 06 15:18:02 <ipun>	when you have time, could you explain your reasoning on the timer? and pehaps where the method/logic is set for how SWT know this is a dragDetect event?
Oct 06 15:18:14 <ipun>	lemme know here im going to lunch
Oct 06 15:23:18 <lufimtse>	ok
Oct 06 15:23:25 <lufimtse>	the comment kinda outlinesi t.
Oct 06 15:23:27 <lufimtse>	outlines it
Oct 06 15:25:12 <lufimtse>	as a note, you might have to update your jhbuild someday

Oct 07 14:31:20 <ipun>	lufimtse so i found out where the bug is, and it is going to fix the drag + drop issue and also the lag
Oct 07 14:31:26 <lufimtse>	hey
Oct 07 14:31:27 <ipun>	however, i am not sure how to approach it.
Oct 07 14:31:46 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 07 14:31:49 <lufimtse>	so the timer thing
Oct 07 14:31:52 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 07 14:31:53 <ipun>	wyes
Oct 07 14:31:55 <ipun>	but 
Oct 07 14:31:58 <lufimtse>	we should set up some verbal chat system
Oct 07 14:32:00 <lufimtse>	meh
Oct 07 14:32:01 <ipun>	its not the timers problem
Oct 07 14:32:01 <lufimtse>	ok, let
Oct 07 14:32:04 <lufimtse>	timer
Oct 07 14:32:05 <lufimtse>	soo
Oct 07 14:32:09 <lufimtse>	the thing about gtk3
Oct 07 14:32:19 <lufimtse>	is that it stopped sending events when mouse moves in dnd
Oct 07 14:32:23 <lufimtse>	for some reason
Oct 07 14:32:29 <lufimtse>	(I should investigate that..)
Oct 07 14:32:35 <lufimtse>	so DnD stopped working
Oct 07 14:32:40 <lufimtse>	because it relied on motion events
Oct 07 14:32:46 <lufimtse>	so
Oct 07 14:32:55 <lufimtse>	I set a timer, that checks for motion every 50 ms
Oct 07 14:33:02 <lufimtse>	it checks for motion by checking mouse position.
Oct 07 14:33:07 <lufimtse>	manually
Oct 07 14:33:11 <lufimtse>	thus the timer
Oct 07 14:33:16 <lufimtse>	it's a hacky solution
Oct 07 14:33:22 <lufimtse>	my early works... 
Oct 07 14:33:27 <lufimtse>	>__>
Oct 07 14:33:31 <lufimtse>	but worked so far.
Oct 07 14:33:37 <ipun>	ah yes its this call right/
Oct 07 14:33:39 <ipun>	gtk_drag_check_threshold
Oct 07 14:33:46 <lufimtse>	<__<
Oct 07 14:33:51 <lufimtse>	^__^
Oct 07 14:33:57 <ipun>	anyways
Oct 07 14:33:58 <lufimtse>	hack comes back to bite me. 
Oct 07 14:33:58 <ipun>	its not your fault
Oct 07 14:34:05 <ipun>	theres still an issue 
Oct 07 14:34:25 <ipun>	basically, the reason why the timer is set off in Wayland is that gdk_event_get() is not returning anything
Oct 07 14:34:39 <ipun>	AND, using your hack, it doesnt notice any drag 
Oct 07 14:34:40 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 07 14:34:43 <ipun>	but
Oct 07 14:35:16 <ipun>	theres a condition that if event == 0 still, return dragOnTimeout, which is true for some reason
Oct 07 14:35:51 <ipun>	but the main issue i think is that gdk_event_get() is not returning anything on a mouse down 
Oct 07 14:36:20 <ipun>	which is why i am thinking this is a GTK bug? but I am not sure if thats true or not, as  idont know how to replicate this on GTk 
Oct 07 14:36:31 <ipun>	consdering how complex this method is being used 
Oct 07 14:39:34 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 07 14:39:49 <lufimtse>	by not return anything you mean it get's stuck or returns null?
Oct 07 14:40:07 <ipun>	returns 0
Oct 07 14:40:30 <ipun>	in X11, it returns an event, thats why cTabFolder moves away from the timeout
Oct 07 14:40:53 <ipun>	however in wayland, no event is returned, so it falls into the timeout loop (500ms) and
Oct 07 14:41:02 <ipun>	somehow defaults to it being "dragged"
Oct 07 14:41:15 <ipun>	which causes eclipse when clicking around tabs to think im dragging them
Oct 07 14:41:51 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 07 14:41:53 <ipun>	this is all in control.java line 2475
Oct 07 14:41:55 <lufimtse>	lemme read some code
Oct 07 14:41:58 <ipun>	kk
Oct 07 14:48:33 <ipun>	i fixed the timeout issue i think, but im trying tofix the drag and drop bug
Oct 07 14:48:44 <ipun>	in line 2509, you had an if condition about dragging
Oct 07 14:49:15 <ipun>	i removed the condition and just made it break instead
Oct 07 14:49:30 <ipun>	i tested it on eclipse anddrag and drop seems to still work for now

Oct 07 14:51:55 <lufimtse>	interesting
Oct 07 14:53:25 <lufimtse>	I think the if (dragging) break; is needed for dragging to start 'early' enough
Oct 07 14:53:38 <lufimtse>	otherwise DnD might only start after 500ms
Oct 07 14:55:36 <lufimtse>	For patches, add me as reviewer :-)
Oct 07 14:56:55 <ipun>	okay
Oct 07 15:00:47 <ipun>	im more confused about the dragOnTimeout garbage, this seemed to be added a while back (not by you)
Oct 07 15:00:49 <ipun>	causing errors
Oct 07 15:01:20 <ipun>	that, or this could be a gdk_event_get bug
Oct 07 15:01:34 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 07 15:01:46 <ipun>	but your saying that your fix as because events in gtk3 dont always populate?
Oct 07 15:02:18 <lufimtse>	Well, gtk3 stopped sending motion events during DnD
Oct 07 15:02:20 <lufimtse>	not sure when
Oct 07 15:02:34 <lufimtse>	Given what I know now, I'd have bisected it to find the gtk version that introduced the change.
Oct 07 15:02:47 <lufimtse>	At the time I didn't even know how to compile gtk
Oct 07 15:02:58 <ipun>	hmm okay
Oct 07 15:22:48 <ipun>	im going to work on it a bit more, do you think its applicable to do somtehing like, if (wayland)?

Oct 18 10:00:42 <ericwill>	ipun what are you working on these days
Oct 18 10:00:46 <ericwill>	wayland stuff?
Oct 18 10:04:05 <ipun>	yeah
Oct 18 10:04:11 <ipun>	its a pain
Oct 18 10:06:58 <ipun>	ericwill theres an issue with cTab in wayland where it thinks its drag and dropping
Oct 18 10:07:02 <ipun>	everytime you click on it
Oct 18 10:07:16 <ipun>	i found the problem im just trying to diagnose if its GTK or us
Oct 18 10:07:38 <ipun>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=503431
Oct 18 10:18:27 <ericwill>	ipun ah yeah
Oct 18 10:18:33 <ericwill>	lots of Wayland work to be done I am sure
Oct 18 10:20:08 <ipun>	mmhm
Oct 18 10:36:05 <ericwill>	lufimtse http://www.eclipse.org/swt/triage.php
Oct 18 11:02:44 <ipun>	lufimtse: played around with using different GTK versions to see if i can get it running, looks like GTK2 works 
Oct 18 11:02:50 <ipun>	but im not sure if GTK2 even supports wayland
Oct 18 11:03:00 <lufimtse>	:-)
Oct 18 11:03:04 <ipun>	considering i cant use GTK inspector, im not sure if my snippet is running in wayland or just defaulted to x11
Oct 18 11:03:07 <lufimtse>	Gtk2 has no wayland support.
Oct 18 11:03:12 <ipun>	ah.
Oct 18 11:03:15 <ipun>	hm.
Oct 18 11:03:20 <lufimtse>	Waynand was not around back then.
Oct 18 11:07:54 <ipun>	well, this annoys me.
Oct 18 11:08:24 <ericwill>	ipun this is what makes Wayland work more tricky
Oct 18 11:08:54 <ipun>	i cant replicate gdk_event_get() behavior on a GTK snippet which annoys me even more
Oct 18 11:09:28 <lufimtse>	Interesting... 
Oct 18 11:09:30 <ipun>	i have a good feeling its a GTK problem but its taking me some time to prove it
Oct 18 11:14:40 <ericwill>	this is interesting: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=78971
Oct 18 12:17:45 <ipun>	lufimtse ericwill, i dont actualyl think gdk_event_get() has been updated to work with wayland
Oct 18 12:17:58 <lufimtse>	hey
Oct 18 12:18:02 <ipun>	older references about gdk_event_get imply it works on X servers
Oct 18 12:18:17 <ipun>	but, doing some git blame the method calls behind it hasnt been updated for many years now
Oct 18 12:19:26 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 18 12:20:28 <lufimtse>	ipun, checkout display.java:826
Oct 18 12:20:35 <lufimtse>	checkIfEventProc(...)
Oct 18 12:20:40 <lufimtse>	line 835
Oct 18 12:20:46 <lufimtse>	and 836
Oct 18 12:21:04 <lufimtse>	if (window == 0) return 0;
Oct 18 12:21:11 <lufimtse>	Try removing that line.
Oct 18 12:21:12 <ipun>	hmmmm....
Oct 18 12:21:14 <ipun>	oaky
Oct 18 12:21:14 <lufimtse>	See woot happens.
Oct 18 12:21:36 <lufimtse>	Does that code run on regular gtk3?
Oct 18 12:21:44 <lufimtse>	Does it even initiate on Wayland?
Oct 18 12:22:06 <ipun>	checkEventProc only runs in X11
Oct 18 12:22:13 <ipun>	neverr gets called in Wayland
Oct 18 12:24:04 <lufimtse>	I think it's a callback
Oct 18 12:24:18 <ipun>	as in?
Oct 18 12:24:18 <lufimtse>	related to expose flashing.
Oct 18 12:24:28 <lufimtse>	expose event I think is when widget is 'visible' to user
Oct 18 12:24:33 <lufimtse>	or visibility changes.
Oct 18 12:24:34 <lufimtse>	hmmmmmmmmmmmm
Oct 18 12:24:52 <lufimtse>	What if you comment out the content of that call and run in X11, does the same issue occur?
Oct 18 12:25:06 <lufimtse>	or dose it magically work well on X11 still
Oct 18 12:25:57 <lufimtse>	Also, does the native GTK snippet work on Gtk3, but not on Wayland, or not work in any situation? 
Oct 18 12:26:30 <ipun>	commetning out the contents leads to it working in X11 still
Oct 18 12:26:49 <ipun>	the proble, with the GTK snippet is that i cant get gdk_event_get() to work correctly in both wayland and X11
Oct 18 12:26:55 <ipun>	its not getting any events in the first place
Oct 18 12:27:09 <ipun>	when i run it it returns null even with a while loop timeout
Oct 18 12:29:10 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 18 12:29:11 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 18 12:29:33 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 18 12:29:47 <ipun>	from the looks of how SWT implements it, it doesnt seem to do any hacky "gdk_put_event()" stuff
Oct 18 12:29:57 <ipun>	so that event shouldve been generated from GTK, which it didnt
Oct 18 12:30:17 <lufimtse>	I found I had similar issue with DnD
Oct 18 12:30:25 <lufimtse>	the motion event was no longer being generated.
Oct 18 12:30:41 <lufimtse>	I should have drilled down to native Gtk level. Instead I implemented DnD on java level
Oct 18 12:30:46 <lufimtse>	lol
Oct 18 12:30:48 <lufimtse>	X-D
Oct 18 12:30:57 <lufimtse>	that was on Gtk3
Oct 18 12:31:06 <lufimtse>	Try with Gtk3.6
Oct 18 12:31:08 <lufimtse>	or Gtk3.3
Oct 18 12:31:10 <lufimtse>	or Gtk3.4
Oct 18 12:31:16 <lufimtse>	I mean the native snippet... 
Oct 18 12:31:29 <lufimtse>	I wonder if something broke going up from older versions
Oct 18 12:31:31 <ipun>	yeah motion isnt being geenrated iether
Oct 18 12:31:44 <lufimtse>	Do other events get generated?
Oct 18 12:31:46 <lufimtse>	like expose?
Oct 18 12:31:51 <ipun>	i havent tested
Oct 18 12:31:58 <lufimtse>	Maybe get it to work for some events
Oct 18 12:32:03 <lufimtse>	like once we know and love
Oct 18 12:32:06 <lufimtse>	like button down
Oct 18 12:32:12 <lufimtse>	and mouse movement events
Oct 18 12:32:13 <ipun>	currently from my swt snippet, X11 generates motion and gtk_button_release
Oct 18 12:32:28 <lufimtse>	what about movement events while button not pressed.
Oct 18 12:32:34 <ipun>	doesnt seem so 
Oct 18 12:32:42 <lufimtse>	does it work on gtk2?
Oct 18 12:32:46 <ipun>	the movement event seems to generate on x11 when im not clicking on it 
Oct 18 12:33:22 <lufimtse>	sekunde... 
Oct 18 12:43:14 <lufimtse>		while (*JsCallFinished == FALSE) {
Oct 18 12:43:14 <lufimtse>			g_main_context_iteration(0, FALSE);
Oct 18 12:43:14 <lufimtse>		}

Oct 19 14:10:02 <ipun>	lufimtse my fix seems to fix the issue + have D&D working
Oct 19 14:11:49 <ipun>	but, it still relies on MOTION_NOTIFY instead of the click event
Oct 19 14:31:14 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 19 14:31:19 <lufimtse>	we kinda want motion notify
Oct 19 14:31:35 <lufimtse>	I wrote the fix because motion notify wasn't being sent
Oct 19 14:31:52 <lufimtse>	take my fix out. Should fix dnd 
Oct 19 14:32:08 <lufimtse>	add mainloop read thing
Oct 19 14:32:23 <lufimtse>	oh, you mean instead*
Oct 19 14:32:24 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 19 14:32:42 <lufimtse>	so u not getting button release at all?
Oct 20 09:56:22 <ipun>	lufimtse, it seems that running g_main_context_iteration () processes the events, but then the vents dont show up in event_get anymore
Oct 20 09:56:43 <ipun>	and i cant seem to find a way to grab the even that is being processed by g_main_context_iteration

Oct 20 11:51:28 <ipun>	lufimtse ping got a question for you
Oct 20 11:51:56 <ipun>	im thinking about mergig gtk_button_press_event with _release_event
Oct 20 11:52:06 <ipun>	but im not exactly sure the best way to do with without causing huge conflict
Oct 20 15:00:07 <lufimtse>	as discussed... 
Oct 20 15:05:03 <ipun>	lufimtse doesnt look like you can get mouse status, im going to try another way potientally
Oct 20 15:05:27 <lufimtse>	did gtk folks say?
Oct 20 15:07:10 <lufimtse>	Have a look:
Oct 20 15:07:10 <lufimtse>	https://developer.gnome.org/gdk3/stable/gdk3-Windows.html#gdk-window-get-device-position
Oct 20 15:07:17 <lufimtse>	 GdkModifierType *mask);
Oct 20 15:07:22 <lufimtse>	-->>> mask
Oct 20 15:07:33 <lufimtse>	GDK_BUTTON1_MASK
Oct 20 15:07:33 <lufimtse>		
Oct 20 15:07:33 <lufimtse>	the first mouse button.
Oct 20 15:07:46 <lufimtse>	in SWT, we use that call: org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.getCursorLocationInPixels()
Oct 20 15:08:15 <lufimtse>	Actually, this is better: org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.gdk_window_get_device_position(long, int[], int[], int[])
Oct 20 15:08:25 <lufimtse>	the last paramater is mask
Oct 20 15:08:33 <lufimtse>	No hard labour needed
Oct 20 15:08:49 <lufimtse>	just use that call, check if that mask contains the BUTTON1 mask.
Oct 20 15:08:54 <lufimtse>	job done.
Oct 20 15:09:00 <lufimtse>	Hopefully :-P
Oct 20 15:09:32 <lufimtse>	I was thinking of going to the cat rescue this weekend maybe.

Oct 31 10:20:47 <ipun>	i did it a while back, i just did it on the website

Oct 31 10:21:06 <ipun>	well the comment was changed 
Oct 31 10:21:20 <ipun>	all i did was change the wording of the comment, and then commented on your own comment
Oct 31 10:22:15 <ipun>	anyways, for your second comment, 2nd/3rd click mouse buttons dont need to be checked as those are not normal buttons used for drag and drop; not used in chrome or any other tab-type applcaitions from my experience
Oct 31 11:24:18 <ipun>	lufimtse let me know if the gerrit change is good so i can close it
Oct 31 14:42:37 <ipun>	tested on wayland, its all good

Nov 08 10:27:29 <ipun>	hey lufimtse, do you think its viable to close https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=501420
Nov 08 10:27:44 <ipun>	last comment basically is the issue, but its been solved (i believe)
Nov 08 10:27:51 <ipun>	doesnt look like anyone followed up with closing the bug
Nov 08 10:27:51 <lufimtse>	hey
Nov 08 10:30:55 <lufimtse>	It seems that the related bug 505923 was fixed. So maybe this bug is fixed also. You could post into the bug suggesting to close it and close it in a week if no one replies.
Nov 08 10:32:40 <ipun>	okay sounds good

Nov 08 14:39:08 <ipun>	lufimtse https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=503431
Nov 08 14:39:43 <ipun>	was fully tested from your comments on gerrit
Nov 08 14:39:47 <ipun>	responded on bugzilla
Nov 08 14:48:49 <lufimtse>	hullo
Nov 08 14:49:40 <lufimtse>	I think last time I asked if it's possible to get this done without use of context_iteration?
Nov 08 14:49:56 <lufimtse>	what happens if you remove that context iteration, but still check status of mouse in the loop?
Nov 08 14:50:11 <lufimtse>	does that work at all or is context iteration absolutley neccessary?
Nov 08 14:50:12 <ipun>	yeah i did that
Nov 08 14:50:18 <ipun>	i thought i told you already here on this channel
Nov 08 14:50:20 <ipun>	it doesnt work
Nov 08 14:50:23 <lufimtse>	I ese
Nov 08 14:50:28 <lufimtse>	I see
Nov 08 14:50:32 <ipun>	if you dont have a context iteration the event never moves on 
Nov 08 14:50:38 <ipun>	it times out pretty much
Nov 08 14:50:59 <lufimtse>	Lemme see patch

Nov 08 15:17:14 <lufimtse>	ipun, could you rebase?

Mar 21 14:04:35 <ipun>	pulled in a bigger audience than last time ( got around ~20 people) 
Mar 21 14:05:28 <ericwill>	nice
Mar 21 14:05:34 <ericwill>	did you meet Lars?
Mar 21 14:05:41 <ericwill>	and did you meet any of the IBM guys?
Mar 21 14:39:07 <lufimtse>	hey
Mar 21 14:39:08 <lufimtse>	sup
Mar 21 14:50:43 <ipun>	lufimtse:did you find the root of the dnd problem? 
Mar 21 14:50:51 <lufimtse>	yah
Mar 21 14:50:53 <lufimtse>	2 memory leack
Mar 21 14:50:54 <lufimtse>	s
Mar 21 14:50:59 <ipun>	ah okay
Mar 21 14:51:01 <ipun>	thanks for finding it!
Mar 21 14:51:05 <lufimtse>	fixed one, fix for other I'm about to push
Mar 21 14:51:15 <lufimtse>	I kinda didn't know Callback.java had to be disposed
Mar 21 14:51:23 <lufimtse>	so I kinda helped you introduce those memory leaks lol.
Mar 21 14:51:28 <ipun>	hopefully thats the most major problems we'll see with my dnd patch
Mar 21 14:51:35 *	ipun shrugs
Mar 21 14:51:54 <lufimtse>	There's still some kinda derp going on. After a while, view-parts dnd stops working.
Mar 21 14:51:55 <lufimtse>	derp
Mar 21 14:52:47 <ipun>	realy?
Mar 21 14:52:52 <ipun>	never had that issue on my end
Mar 21 14:53:04 <ipun>	must be some gesture callback problem
Mar 21 15:02:01 <ipun>	lufimtse ericwill : where can i check if my patches were in M6 or not?
Mar 21 15:02:25 <lufimtse>	If they're older than when M6 was released, they're part of M6.
Mar 21 15:02:36 <ericwill>	yeah if they were merged before the freeze date, it's in
Mar 21 15:04:47 <ipun>	where can i find the freeze date
Mar 21 15:06:08 <ericwill>	ipun https://wiki.eclipse.org/Oxygen/Simultaneous_Release_Plan#Schedule
Mar 21 15:06:17 <ipun>	thank you
Mar 21 15:07:34 <ipun>	ericwill: date says march 17, does that mean everything committed to master before the 17th is in m6?
Mar 21 15:08:31 <ericwill>	ipun I think so?
Mar 21 15:09:51 <ipun>	okay

Apr 06 12:15:17 <lufimtse>	Welcome Alex.
Apr 06 12:15:32 <akurtakov>	ipun: so are you going to revert everything ?
Apr 06 12:15:37 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hey :)
Apr 06 12:15:58 <ipun>	akurtakov: trust me, i have no choice
Apr 06 12:16:07 <lufimtse>	note:
Apr 06 12:16:08 <ipun>	but after the revert, i plan on adding the changes
Apr 06 12:16:11 <ipun>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94497/
Apr 06 12:16:26 <ipun>	this changeset basically includes the full revert + some development ive done that may solve this
Apr 06 12:16:57 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 12:17:09 <akurtakov>	I trust lufimtse for proper review
Apr 06 12:17:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the idea here is to keep DnD as part of MouseDown. It's not neccessarily what Gtk does, but it preserves Cocoa/Win32 compatability.
Apr 06 12:17:39 <lufimtse>	And thus custom widgets would not have to be changed.
Apr 06 12:18:27 <akurtakov>	this would not affect the gestures supprot, right?
Apr 06 12:18:36 <lufimtse>	you mean swiping?
Apr 06 12:18:37 <ipun>	akurtakov: no it wont
Apr 06 12:18:38 <akurtakov>	it shouldn't but I want to be sure
Apr 06 12:18:43 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 12:18:49 <ipun>	the way i implemented it wont affect this
Apr 06 12:19:52 <ipun>	there should be a dragGesture set on it nonetheless
Apr 06 12:20:12 <ipun>	but for consistency ill test it on my laptop
Apr 06 12:21:26 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 12:21:49 <akurtakov>	the patch is not ready for test yet, right?
Apr 06 12:22:00 <ipun>	its ready for testing for x11/wayland
Apr 06 12:24:08 <akurtakov>	http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2017/04/thank-you-note-to-hackernews.html
Apr 06 12:25:29 <ipun>	what a great day
Apr 06 12:27:01 <akurtakov>	https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/06/canonical_cuts_jobs_with_unity_bullet/
Apr 06 12:27:07 <akurtakov>	ubuntu seems to be sinking
Apr 06 12:30:08 <ipun>	akurtakov: confirmed that gestures is working
Apr 06 12:30:12 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 12:37:24 <ipun>	akurtakov: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94497/
Apr 06 12:37:27 <ipun>	thats the reverted changes
Apr 06 12:37:46 <ipun>	did you want me to do another commit that shows the additional patch on top of that revert?
Apr 06 12:37:55 <akurtakov>	ipun: exactly
Apr 06 12:38:05 <akurtakov>	so when I fetch the second one I get everything in shape 
Apr 06 12:38:49 <ipun>	akurtakov: did you want it in a different gerrit review or as a new patchset?
Apr 06 12:39:06 <akurtakov>	another review on top of the revert one
Apr 06 12:43:38 <ipun>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94597/
Apr 06 12:43:43 <ipun>	akurtakov ^
Apr 06 12:49:08 <akurtakov>	ipun: still when full line selection dnd is activated instead deselection
Apr 06 12:49:16 <akurtakov>	but not always tbh
Apr 06 12:50:04 <akurtakov>	for both x11 and wayland
Apr 06 12:50:31 <akurtakov>	if everything is reverted why break x11 ?
Apr 06 12:51:23 <akurtakov>	I insist on leaving x11 on being in the way it is currently
Apr 06 12:51:41 <ipun>	akurtakov: because lufimtse said to do it for x11 too :)
Apr 06 12:51:46 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: NO
Apr 06 12:51:49 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 06 12:52:00 <ipun>	akurtakov: i insisted no
Apr 06 12:52:04 *	ipun shrugs
Apr 06 12:52:20 <akurtakov>	any chance of potential breakage now should be reduced
Apr 06 12:52:45 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: please take this seriously, we can not afford more X11 regressions
Apr 06 12:53:15 <akurtakov>	no matter you like it or not - it stays how it is until wayland proven tobe stable
Apr 06 12:54:18 <akurtakov>	once wayland is stable we can speak of unifying 
Apr 06 12:54:26 <akurtakov>	we are almost at M7 and everything is broken
Apr 06 12:54:27 <lufimtse>	May I suggest to leave things as is until Oxygen is released and then work on things?
Apr 06 12:54:44 <akurtakov>	for x11 yes 
Apr 06 12:54:53 <akurtakov>	for wayland - it has to work in Oxygen
Apr 06 12:55:12 <ipun>	lufimtse: we can still include the fix i did and guard it with isX11
Apr 06 12:56:14 <akurtakov>	ipun: +1
Apr 06 12:56:34 <ipun>	lufimtse: ill even comment it with // Wayland for you :)
Apr 06 12:56:37 <akurtakov>	further more on x11 the new patch doesn't switch ctabs with first click but with secon
Apr 06 12:56:40 <lufimtse>	In the sense I wasn't planning on the new DnD changes to take place until after Oxygen.
Apr 06 12:56:52 <lufimtse>	./forgot to mention. 
Apr 06 12:57:08 <lufimtse>	We're ok with having a bunch of !x11 guards
Apr 06 12:57:13 <lufimtse>	so long as current code stays same.
Apr 06 12:58:02 <akurtakov>	btw with the new code
Apr 06 12:58:33 <akurtakov>	I end up with the old funny bug of moving around ctabs instead of switching them on wayland
Apr 06 12:58:50 <ipun>	akurtakov: yeah i just noticed that
Apr 06 12:58:57 <ipun>	sigh 
Apr 06 12:59:08 <ipun>	this really sucks 
Apr 06 12:59:13 <akurtakov>	that's worse than current master which has only StyledText broken on wayland
Apr 06 12:59:17 <lufimtse>	It might be because MouseRelease is fired before MouseDown is finished.
Apr 06 12:59:47 <lufimtse>	Not sure thou. 
Apr 06 13:03:36 <akurtakov>	so guys, let's make things clear on one thing - x11 stays as it is and everything regarding wayland is guarded with if !x11
Apr 06 13:03:53 <akurtakov>	for at least 2 milestones once we put it int
Apr 06 13:03:58 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, We initially started moving DnD logic into MouseMovement, because that's the 'gtk' method of doing it and is more sound. However, after time we discovered that this approach causes breakage in Custom widgets.    -> As such we are now seeking to get DnD logic to work in MouseDown for wayland.
Apr 06 13:04:09 <akurtakov>	until even thinking of unifying it
Apr 06 13:04:29 <lufimtse>	I have no objections against if !x11 guard for now.
Apr 06 13:05:17 <akurtakov>	so are we saying we go with MouseMove for wayland and MouseDown for x11 for Oxygen?
Apr 06 13:05:32 <lufimtse>	No,
Apr 06 13:05:36 <lufimtse>	hmm
Apr 06 13:05:41 <lufimtse>	sec.
Apr 06 13:05:52 <akurtakov>	this is what we have in master, right?
Apr 06 13:06:03 <akurtakov>	fwiw, it's the best thing I have seen so far
Apr 06 13:06:28 <lufimtse>	X11 will be same as is now in oxygen, no changes
Apr 06 13:06:32 <lufimtse>	for Wayland .... 
Apr 06 13:06:41 <lufimtse>	1) We will work on mouseDown solution
Apr 06 13:06:46 <lufimtse>	2) In mean time leave mouseMove
Apr 06 13:07:02 <lufimtse>	if mouseDown solution is good to go, use that in Oxygen. If not, leave mouse move.
Apr 06 13:07:08 <lufimtse>	does that make sense?
Apr 06 13:07:33 <akurtakov>	ok, when do we put the deadline for that decision?
Apr 06 13:08:15 <lufimtse>	I think deadline is dependent on if MouseMove method will be up and running in time. I propose to keep things in patches and out of master for now.
Apr 06 13:08:49 <lufimtse>	At least until Oxygen release.
Apr 06 13:09:14 <lufimtse>	This should ensure consistent behaviour until we are ready for switch. 
Apr 06 13:09:28 <lufimtse>	For the switch, we will be doing extensive testing to make sure all reported regressions do not occur.
Apr 06 13:10:44 <lufimtse>	Thoughts?
Apr 06 13:12:58 <akurtakov>	well, I still want wayland + oxygen in better shape
Apr 06 13:13:35 <lufimtse>	Can you define "better", do you mean functioning styledText?
Apr 06 13:14:13 <akurtakov>	yes if possible
Apr 06 13:14:23 <akurtakov>	or at least what we can get 
Apr 06 13:14:29 <lufimtse>	This would require us to get MouseDown solution working.
Apr 06 13:14:30 <akurtakov>	even if it's baby steps 
Apr 06 13:14:35 <lufimtse>	on wayland
Apr 06 13:14:39 <akurtakov>	or improve on the MouseMove
Apr 06 13:14:51 <lufimtse>	MouseMove has architectural problem,
Apr 06 13:15:09 <akurtakov>	for which I want a deadline - how much time do we give MouseDown to see it's working
Apr 06 13:15:16 <lufimtse>	I see.
Apr 06 13:15:19 <lufimtse>	Hmmm.
Apr 06 13:15:27 <lufimtse>	Let me think.
Apr 06 13:15:32 <akurtakov>	it may have arch problem but it is smth that we will release in June
Apr 06 13:15:47 <akurtakov>	and will live with us for the next 14-16 months
Apr 06 13:15:58 <lufimtse>	Is "IS_GTK" accetable in styled text?
Apr 06 13:16:11 <lufimtse>	and CTabFolder?
Apr 06 13:16:33 <akurtakov>	no, because IS_GTK solution would do changes for x11 too - which is unwanted
Apr 06 13:16:46 <akurtakov>	and this is jsut the tip of the iceberg
Apr 06 13:16:47 <lufimtse>	Then we have a problem with MouseMove approach.
Apr 06 13:17:05 <lufimtse>	MouseMove + Stayled text requires IS_GTK. 
Apr 06 13:17:22 <lufimtse>	As such, we have to push for MouseDown.
Apr 06 13:17:31 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 06 13:17:42 <lufimtse>	Please give me a few minutes to think.
Apr 06 13:18:01 <akurtakov>	or it requires if (!x11 && control instanceof StyledText) kind of hacks in Drag*
Apr 06 13:19:16 <akurtakov>	ipun: do you think you can enhance StyledText after trippleclick on wayland with current master
Apr 06 13:19:43 <lufimtse>	Interesting...
Apr 06 13:20:09 <akurtakov>	and we continue fighting wayland that way as we find issues
Apr 06 13:20:29 <lufimtse>	BTW, can we modify things until RC3 Friday, June 09?
Apr 06 13:21:55 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: with each next step you need one more additional +1
Apr 06 13:21:58 <akurtakov>	first one more committer
Apr 06 13:22:08 <akurtakov>	next +project lead
Apr 06 13:22:14 <akurtakov>	next + PMC approval
Apr 06 13:24:50 <akurtakov>	see here from last year
Apr 06 13:25:45 <akurtakov>	https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/freeze_plan_4_6.php#FixPassAfterRC0 specifically
Apr 06 13:27:16 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: this year will be pretty much the same
Apr 06 13:29:49 <lufimtse>	I see.
Apr 06 13:30:23 <lufimtse>	So basically we have until May 4th to make changes freely, after that it's difficult?
Apr 06 13:30:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, is that correct?
Apr 06 13:30:49 <akurtakov>	yes
Apr 06 13:31:05 <lufimtse>	In that case, I have the following suggestion:
Apr 06 13:31:19 <lufimtse>	- We stick to current MouseMove and try to hack things via instanceOf
Apr 06 13:31:29 <lufimtse>	- THEN, work on MouseDown architecture
Apr 06 13:31:33 <akurtakov>	works for me
Apr 06 13:32:00 <akurtakov>	THEN might be delayed  though
Apr 06 13:32:10 <lufimtse>	I see.
Apr 06 13:32:26 <akurtakov>	as we need also Webkit2 finished early in Photon too
Apr 06 13:32:43 <lufimtse>	feasible.
Apr 06 13:33:36 <lufimtse>	So my understanding ME:  DnD polish && Webkit2 polish -> Oxygen release -> Webkit2 Browser function && DnD MouseDown architecture
Apr 06 13:33:40 <lufimtse>	that correct?
Apr 06 13:33:52 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Apr 06 13:34:24 <akurtakov>	after Oxygen release -> + ton of other things :)
Apr 06 13:34:29 <lufimtse>	X-D
Apr 06 13:34:30 <lufimtse>	ok.
Apr 06 13:34:35 <lufimtse>	Fair game.
Apr 06 13:34:49 <lufimtse>	I'm off to lunch.
Apr 06 13:34:56 <lufimtse>	I'll chat with Ian in a bit.
Apr 06 13:36:04 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 14:29:39 <ipun>	akurtakov: I'm going to dive deeper into what i've done with motion drags and see ifi can get this working with styledtext using instanceOf
Apr 06 14:29:53 <akurtakov>	ipun: good
Apr 06 14:30:05 <ipun>	i much prefer the mouse movement stuff anyways
Apr 06 14:30:25 <lufimtse>	ipun, sendDragEvent (gdkEvent.button, gdkEvent.state, (int) gdkEvent.x, (int) gdkEvent.y, false); << delay execution of that guy.
Apr 06 14:30:29 <lufimtse>	basically.
Apr 06 14:30:49 <ipun>	lufimtse: i figured you were talking about that
Apr 06 14:30:53 <ipun>	ill work something around it now
Apr 06 14:30:55 <akurtakov>	only thing I prefer is the working one :)
Apr 06 14:31:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, he he :-)
Apr 06 15:01:06 <ipun>	can you allow  (IS_GTK) additions to styledText?
Apr 06 15:01:10 <ipun>	if it all works that is
Apr 06 15:01:20 <ipun>	akurtakov: 
Apr 06 15:02:29 <akurtakov>	ipun: wouldn't that change x11 behavior too ?
Apr 06 15:02:50 <ipun>	akurtakov: if i could figure out a solution to not change x11 behavior, could i do it?
Apr 06 15:03:36 <akurtakov>	in general I don't like the idea but if there is no other way and you can make it to not change x11 we can speak about it
Apr 06 15:03:46 <akurtakov>	but note that I'll question it heavily
Apr 06 15:03:59 <ipun>	okay sounds good

Apr 12 12:11:30 <ipun>	akurtakov: regarding the GtkText fix, I don't seem to be running into the crash on X11
Apr 12 12:11:39 <ipun>	are you doing a Text -> label transfer on DnDExample?
Apr 12 12:16:40 <akurtakov>	ipun: yes
Apr 12 12:16:58 <akurtakov>	ipun: I make it crash one out of 3 tries
Apr 12 12:17:53 <ipun>	wierd... I cant seem to do it
Apr 12 12:18:11 <ipun>	let me check out my logic again and maybe it screwed up the x11 passages
Apr 12 12:18:22 <akurtakov>	do you use this patch on top of your queue patch or on top of master ?
Apr 12 12:29:32 <ipun>	akurtakov: the patch was only off of master
Apr 12 12:29:50 <ipun>	are you doing it off of my queue patch as well?
Apr 12 12:33:41 <akurtakov>	yes
Apr 12 12:40:09 <ipun>	hmm okay ill play around with that as well then
Apr 12 12:49:55 <ipun>	i havent been able to replicate the crash but I do notice it being slower. Ill see what i can do
Apr 12 12:50:41 <ipun>	also seems to be completely broken in Wayland on text
Apr 12 13:00:05 <ipun>	could you try with the latest patch when you have time?
Apr 13 09:36:09 <ipun>	akurtakov: did you get a chance to see if https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94861 works?
Apr 13 09:36:18 <akurtakov>	doing it now
Apr 13 09:36:22 <ipun>	kk thanks
Apr 13 09:38:53 <akurtakov>	ipun: sorry , happens again
Apr 13 09:39:08 <akurtakov>	ipun: double click to select a word
Apr 13 09:39:11 <akurtakov>	dnd - works
Apr 13 09:39:23 <akurtakov>	repeat with another word - crash
Apr 13 09:39:34 <ipun>	ah i can reproduce it now
Apr 13 09:39:35 <ipun>	thank you
Apr 13 09:40:04 <akurtakov>	ipun: np, sorry if I wasn't clear the first time :)
Apr 13 09:40:44 <ipun>	akurtakov: its okay. With that I should be able to get to the bottom of this. My fix inherinently shouldnt cause any harm to x11 but it is, so this is important
Apr 13 09:42:04 <ipun>	okay the problem actually started with 510446, not 515035
Apr 13 09:42:32 <akurtakov>	?
Apr 13 09:46:10 <akurtakov>	I have to run now, happy easter :)
Apr 13 09:46:12 <ipun>	akurtakov: actually i lied
Apr 13 09:46:16 <ipun>	its not working on master
Apr 13 09:46:29 <ipun>	anyways ill figure it out :)

Apr 19 10:27:27 <akurtakov>	let him move to the launchbar
Apr 19 10:27:32 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 19 10:27:35 <lufimtse>	bt
Apr 19 10:27:36 <lufimtse>	btw
Apr 19 10:27:43 <lufimtse>	can I get you to test a patch briefly
Apr 19 10:27:50 <akurtakov>	sure
Apr 19 10:28:07 <lufimtse>	Can you checkout and see if DnD works on your machine with this guy:
Apr 19 10:28:07 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95207/
Apr 19 10:28:13 <lufimtse>	It's based on SWT code that's 1 year old
Apr 19 10:28:18 <lufimtse>	so eclipse is buggy on it
Apr 19 10:28:29 <lufimtse>	but i just want to know if dnd works on your machine 
Apr 19 10:28:32 <lufimtse>	with that guy
Apr 19 10:28:36 <lufimtse>	tests:
Apr 19 10:28:44 <lufimtse>	1) StyledText, select text, drag
Apr 19 10:28:49 <lufimtse>	2) Package explorer
Apr 19 10:28:52 <lufimtse>	3) Staging area
Apr 19 10:28:56 <lufimtse>	3) DnD example
Apr 19 10:29:30 <lufimtse>	There's a quirck with StyledText DnD backwards selection & moving forward, but that's to be investigated later. For now Just want to know if basic dnd works.
Apr 19 10:30:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, let me know once done
Apr 19 10:47:10 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: DnD example seems to be fine
Apr 19 10:47:19 <akurtakov>	but eclipse is not starting for me
Apr 19 10:47:27 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, fair enough.
Apr 19 10:47:29 <lufimtse>	thank you.
Apr 19 10:47:44 <akurtakov>	it is just stuck on startup
Apr 19 11:57:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, yea, it's swt from a year ago. Maybe something's flaky.

Apr 19 12:58:21 <akurtakov>	guys I'll not find time to test the dnd this week
Apr 19 12:58:36 <akurtakov>	so please test/push yourself
Apr 19 13:00:08 <lufimtse>	ipun, akurtakov I encourage you guys to use the rebuild_swt_natives.sh script. Automates bunch of mundate tasks.
Apr 19 13:00:11 <lufimtse>	cd ~/bin/
Apr 19 13:00:16 <lufimtse>	ln -s ~/git/eclipse.platform.swt/bundles/org.eclipse.swt.tools/gtk/rebuild_swt_natives.sh swtb
Apr 19 13:00:24 <lufimtse>	ex ^ sim-link to it.
Apr 19 13:00:33 <lufimtse>	but note, I pushed a change just now so that it works when symlinked.
Apr 19 13:00:55 <lufimtse>	with above you can use via 'swtb'
Apr 19 13:01:19 <akurtakov>	will this create git noise ?
Apr 19 13:01:29 <akurtakov>	ah it's in bin sorry :)
Apr 19 13:01:49 <lufimtse>	this is for personal machine
Apr 19 13:02:21 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: well, there is mail from Martin asking for building swt natives on the mailing list
Apr 19 13:02:29 <akurtakov>	and getting confused with the wiki
Apr 19 13:02:32 <lufimtse>	let me check
Apr 19 13:06:14 <akurtakov>	looks like some cleanup in the content is needed
Apr 19 13:06:28 <akurtakov>	simpler howto maybe with less conditions :)
Apr 19 13:06:52 <akurtakov>	doh of the webpage I mean
Apr 19 13:07:59 <akurtakov>	sigh, we should really automate this inside eclipse
Apr 19 15:44:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ipun the DnD patch for manually managing outging SWT.Mouse* events is in. I.e, DnD in external widgets like styledText and CTabFolder should be functional.
Apr 19 15:45:04 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: cool, can't wait for tomorrow's build :)
Apr 19 15:52:18 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, btw do you know: If you have a 'dltk' buildCommand in the .project (I.e, shelled support), but you don't have shelled installed, are there any problems?
Apr 19 15:52:24 <lufimtse>	or is it silently installed?
Apr 19 15:52:46 <akurtakov>	it is silently ignored
Apr 19 15:52:48 <lufimtse>	yay
Apr 19 15:53:06 <akurtakov>	well, not build command but nature :)
Apr 19 15:54:20 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: there is wip to make marketplace client proposing to install though 
Apr 19 15:54:22 <akurtakov>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=513306
Apr 19 15:54:28 <akurtakov>	hopefully for oxygen
Apr 19 15:56:48 <lufimtse>	interesting
Apr 19 15:56:56 <lufimtse>	is it working atm? only with the ini setting?
Apr 19 15:57:06 <lufimtse>	lemme ping Mickael
Apr 19 15:58:08 *	akurtakov feels like walking organizer for the release train :)
Apr 19 16:00:38 <ipun>	akurtakov: where did you get any of the information about XSetInputFocus and such from SHell.java | line 573 and below?
Apr 19 16:00:55 <akurtakov>	ipun: let me open swt :)
Apr 19 16:01:17 *	akurtakov jumps from p2 to swt :)
Apr 19 16:02:01 <akurtakov>	ipun: the comment iis in the wrong place
Apr 19 16:02:13 <akurtakov>	it should be in the if X11 block
Apr 19 16:02:36 <akurtakov>	XSetInputFocus is xlib function so makes no sense outside of it
Apr 19 16:03:54 <ipun>	it is inside the x11 block im just curious how you got this information on how to handle override redirects
Apr 19 16:04:36 <akurtakov>	ipun: no idea 
Apr 19 16:04:53 <akurtakov>	this is from the very first kept commit in the repo :)
Apr 19 16:08:28 <ipun>	DANG
Apr 19 16:09:02 <akurtakov>	ipun: so gtk_window_present that is commented does nothing ?
Apr 19 16:09:10 <ipun>	does nothing
Apr 19 16:09:55 <akurtakov>	same for .gdk_window_focus (window, OS.GDK_CURRENT_TIME); ?
Apr 19 16:12:48 <ipun>	it was giving us that "gtk window_present_with_time" failure, and we tried using the proper time with it and it still failed
Apr 19 16:17:27 <akurtakov>	no idea :)
Apr 19 16:22:12 <ipun>	thanks anyways akurtakov :)

Apr 21 14:57:34 <akurtakov>	and most important quite safe change
Apr 21 14:57:50 <ipun>	yeah tried to keep it that way :)
Apr 21 15:00:05 <ipun>	k its rebased
Apr 21 15:11:37 <akurtakov>	ipun: can you type in the text fielter ?
Apr 21 15:13:02 <akurtakov>	ipun: you need many(6-8+) launch configs for it to show at the top
Apr 21 15:13:35 <akurtakov>	ipun: another issue if you alt-tap to another app the popup stays on tp
Apr 21 15:13:38 <akurtakov>	on top
Apr 21 15:15:10 <akurtakov>	ipun: it's really weird - I can select text in the filter with mouse but can't type in it
Apr 21 15:15:48 <ipun>	hmm okay
Apr 21 15:16:33 <ipun>	i can type in mine
Apr 21 15:17:34 <ipun>	also i it looks like it doesnt automatically focus on the textbox when you click it. But if you click the textbox you are able to start typing
Apr 21 15:19:18 <ipun>	akurtakov: did you mean that the filterbox shows up only after 6-8+ lunach configs are displayed? or do you mean anything under that it is not at the top?
Apr 21 15:23:02 <ipun>	if you look at CSelector.java | line 318 that is where you dont see the filter box until at least 8
Apr 21 15:25:50 <akurtakov>	weird, I can't type in mine
Apr 21 15:25:56 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: can you?

Apr 21 15:29:06 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ok

Apr 21 15:33:02 <akurtakov>	ok

Apr 21 15:34:53 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, where is the launchbar?
Apr 21 15:35:02 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, is it part of a cdt plugin, do you know which one?
Apr 21 15:35:10 <lufimtse>	it doesn't seem to be a separate plugin
Apr 21 15:35:30 <lufimtse>	ipun, can you spy on the thing to find out which plugin it's from?
Apr 21 15:35:40 <lufimtse>	ipun, or look into your installed plugin business

Apr 21 15:52:42 <lufimtse>	ipun, testing...
Apr 21 15:55:16 <lufimtse>	ipun, when I start a child Eclipse, the launchbar is no where to be found. Do you know how to make it appaer? (I tried all the target platform plugins enabled)

Apr 24 10:28:56 <ipun>	basically the GTK_POPUP type of shell doesnt let you grab keyboard focus right away from my testing, so you'll notice that the filter box actually isnt focused when you click it in Wayland

Apr 24 12:37:50 <ipun>	okay in that case ill get lufimtse to just run the snippet instead of messing around with launchbar 
Apr 24 12:38:27 <ipun>	akurtakov: when you click the textbox, is it selected at all? (blue highlight around the edges of the box)
Apr 24 12:41:30 <akurtakov>	ipun: no
Apr 24 12:41:41 <akurtakov>	ipun: it's visible on the video I sent you too
Apr 24 12:43:28 <ipun>	hmmm...the fix was within Shell.java | line 712 setting the type hint. Im trying to figure out why that works in the first place on mine
Apr 24 12:43:34 <lufimtse>	ipun, ok, let me test the snippet on wayland

Apr 24 12:44:10 *	Now talking on #SWT
Apr 24 12:51:34 <ipun>	akurtakov: its  very annoying as im trying to run gtk inspector on the popup window to debug and its just SWT FIXED
Apr 24 12:51:39 <ipun>	doesnt show any infomration about type
Apr 24 12:58:52 <akurtakov>	ipun: SwtFixed should have children
Apr 24 13:00:31 <akurtakov>	so it doesn't work fro lufimtse too
Apr 24 13:00:54 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, yea,
Apr 24 13:01:06 <lufimtse>	<ian is in kitchen snacking> :-)
Apr 24 13:01:53 <ipun>	damn
Apr 24 13:01:55 <ipun>	okay
Apr 24 13:02:00 <ipun>	thats good i guess
Apr 24 13:02:03 <ipun>	now time ti figure out why mine works
Apr 24 13:04:14 <akurtakov>	ipun: fighting stress with icecream ? :)
Apr 24 13:04:32 <ipun>	akurtakov: if only there was icecream...
Apr 24 13:04:43 <ipun>	also, it doesnt look like i can claim my beer from you this year
Apr 24 13:04:45 <ipun>	:(
Apr 24 13:05:05 <akurtakov>	ipun: haha :)
Apr 24 13:05:20 <akurtakov>	I remember it but not what it was for :)
Apr 24 13:05:43 <ipun>	"SWT"
Apr 24 13:05:46 <ipun>	just kidding ;)
Apr 24 13:09:52 <ipun>	gonna do an update for fedora and see if i can reproduce
Apr 24 13:10:36 <akurtakov>	so you're not running latest f25 ?

Apr 24 13:18:40 *	Now talking on #SWT
Apr 24 13:31:41 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: just saw your promise to test on the mpc bug
Apr 24 13:31:48 <akurtakov>	fwiw, I use smth like http://www.babblingengineer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gtd_chart.png
Apr 24 13:31:58 <akurtakov>	where I have changed 2 mins with 15 mins
Apr 24 13:32:20 <akurtakov>	works pretty well for me to finish many things and don't let the queue grow
Apr 24 14:13:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I do something simmilar
Apr 24 14:13:30 <lufimtse>	this week is an exception
Apr 24 14:13:36 <lufimtse>	^_^
Apr 24 14:19:10 <akurtakov>	yeah, I understand that
Apr 24 14:19:19 <akurtakov>	I'm just giving you a hint :)
Apr 24 14:21:41 <ipun>	akurtakov: i have still no idea why this works on my computer and not anyone elses...
Apr 24 14:22:09 <ipun>	akurtakov, lufimtse what gtk versions are you running?
Apr 24 14:22:24 <lufimtse>	3.22
Apr 24 14:22:32 <lufimtse>	3.22.11
Apr 24 14:23:13 <ipun>	i wonder if its because im using 3.22.12
Apr 24 14:27:33 <ipun>	care to update lufimtse ?
Apr 24 14:28:07 <lufimtse>	ipun, I could
Apr 24 14:28:36 <lufimtse>	gtk is not marked for upgrade on my system
Apr 24 14:28:37 <lufimtse>	meh
Apr 24 14:28:40 <lufimtse>	sudo dnf update
Apr 24 14:28:44 <lufimtse>	ipun, 
Apr 24 14:28:58 <ipun>	oh.
Apr 24 14:28:58 <lufimtse>	ipun, can you test with an older gtk?
Apr 24 14:28:59 <lufimtse>	3.20
Apr 24 14:29:02 <lufimtse>	see if it reproduces
Apr 24 14:29:03 <lufimtse>	etc
Apr 24 14:30:15 <ipun>	kk ill gvie it a go
Apr 24 14:31:36 <ipun>	sigh my 3.2 doesnt run wayland
Apr 24 14:32:40 <ipun>	tried it on gtk3.189 and it works
Apr 24 14:33:11 <ipun>	lufimtse: care to come swing by in a bit to see if i forgotsomething?
Apr 24 14:33:34 <lufimtse>	hey
Apr 24 15:29:15 <ipun>	hey akurtakov did you say that doing any api additions require a lot more work now?
Apr 24 15:29:28 <akurtakov>	yes
Apr 24 15:29:34 <ipun>	to fix something up in GTKText fix i was thinking about adding a getDragGesture() call
Apr 24 15:29:51 <akurtakov>	that would not be new API ?
Apr 24 15:30:05 <ipun>	no it would just be a method within control
Apr 24 15:30:20 <akurtakov>	as long as it's default/private it should be fine
Apr 24 15:30:24 <ipun>	cause we have a setDragGesture(), but no getDragGesture()
Apr 24 15:30:30 <ipun>	hmm okay let me see if it works oaky
Apr 24 15:33:21 <ipun>	akurtakov: it looks like it would have to be public for the sake that other methods should be able to get the Gesture widgets if needed
Apr 24 15:33:30 *	ipun feels like that might take a bit more convincing
Apr 24 15:35:01 <akurtakov>	setDragGesture is private
Apr 24 15:35:14 <akurtakov>	why would you need to set it ?
Apr 24 15:36:43 <akurtakov>	ipun: ^
Apr 24 15:37:30 <ipun>	akurtakov: the addition would be a public method getDragGesture(), i wouldnt be changing setDragGesture() at all
Apr 24 15:37:37 <ipun>	that should remain private
Apr 24 15:37:44 <akurtakov>	why?
Apr 24 15:37:53 <akurtakov>	and what would you return ?
Apr 24 15:38:04 <ipun>	it would just return the controls DragSource widget
Apr 24 15:38:10 <ipun>	DragGesture*
Apr 24 15:38:30 <akurtakov>	ipun: and how would that look on win32/cocoa?
Apr 24 15:39:05 <ipun>	akurtakov: ...hmm i see what you mean
Apr 24 15:39:15 <ipun>	okay no worries, i will figure out another way
Apr 24 15:39:32 <ipun>	it wouldnt work publically for win32/cocoa for sure i didnt think of that my bad
Apr 24 15:39:32 <akurtakov>	to make it clear in order to add new api it has to be implemented on 2 out of 3 (gtk,cocoa, win32)
Apr 24 15:40:10 <akurtakov>	and adding such api at this time and out of the blue  (even if implemented on 2 WS) has zero chances 
Apr 24 15:40:18 <akurtakov>	ipun: try to explain to me why you need it
Apr 24 15:48:13 <ipun>	in regards to GTKText, it currently fixes the issue but when DragBegin signal is caught from GTK, i make it send a DragStart SWT signal back with no x/y coordinates. Having the DragGesture widget will let me grab the correct x/y coordinates to send to SWT 
Apr 24 15:54:34 <akurtakov>	think of IoC 
Apr 24 15:54:42 <akurtakov>	instanceof? maybe
Apr 24 15:56:53 <ipun>	if i use instance of i could grab private values?
Apr 24 15:59:33 <ipun>	akurtakov: would making the dragGestures public instead of having a public method be any different?
Apr 24 16:43:59 <ipun>	lufimtse: it doesnt look likei can get the x/y coordinates the easy way
Apr 24 16:44:34 <lufimtse>	ipun, hmmm
Apr 24 16:44:38 <ipun>	its okay though
Apr 24 16:44:43 <ipun>	ill see if i can figure out another way
Apr 24 16:44:45 <ipun>	may not be the most accurate
Apr 24 16:47:44 <ipun>	got it, pushed now
Apr 24 17:24:03 <ipun>	lufimtse: take a look at the chagnes i did when you have time
Apr 24 17:24:10 <ipun>	should be possible
Apr 24 17:24:12 <ipun>	pushable*
Apr 25 09:22:54 <ipun>	akurtakov: i got a better fix that doesnt need any change to api
Apr 25 09:23:02 <ipun>	just waiting for lufimtse to check it out
Apr 25 09:23:17 <ipun>	i'll just be using internal Display cursor location call instead
Apr 25 09:23:43 <akurtakov>	ipun: sounds good :)
Apr 25 11:20:57 <ipun>	lufimtse: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95705/ 
Apr 25 11:21:01 <ipun>	mind if you do a quick check on this one?
Apr 25 11:21:04 <ipun>	just a one liner
Apr 25 11:21:07 <lufimtse>	ipun, Lemme see
Apr 25 11:22:41 <akurtakov>	ipun: definetely not OK
Apr 25 11:22:59 <akurtakov>	this would make various plugins fail with SWTError
Apr 25 11:23:14 <ipun>	akurtakov: where do you propose we put the SWT error?
Apr 25 11:23:24 <akurtakov>	there shouldn't be an error
Apr 25 11:23:54 <akurtakov>	it should do the next best thing to cover this case or nothing
Apr 25 11:23:56 <akurtakov>	but no error
Apr 25 11:24:07 <ipun>	okay sounds good
Apr 25 12:14:59 <ipun>	akurtakov, lufimtse: new patchset will just include a error but wont cause it to crash. Leo, you can use new SWTError().printStackTrace() to do that instead of system.err
Apr 25 12:16:02 <lufimtse>	ipun, thanks for sharing
Apr 25 12:16:40 <ipun>	lufimtse: no problem
Apr 25 12:17:20 <ipun>	akurtakov: the only work done by GTK team to support gtkSockets is this: https://github.com/alexlarsson/wakefield but this hasnt been worked on for 2 years...
Apr 25 12:17:43 <ipun>	the patch i included will just warn and wont block, so i guess it techincally do "nothing"
Apr 26 09:40:13 <ipun>	akurtakov: could you take a screenshot of the page you're referring to in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95734/ please?
Apr 26 09:41:24 <akurtakov>	ipun: https://imagebin.ca/v/3KPD9JscLDyX
Apr 26 09:50:18 <ipun>	akurtakov: how did you get to that dialog? I normally just click Run configurations and edit from there and it doesnt give me that problem
Apr 26 09:50:47 <akurtakov>	ipun: gear button in launch configuration 
Apr 26 09:50:56 <akurtakov>	launchbar I mean
Apr 26 09:51:19 <ipun>	ohh right
Apr 26 09:53:02 <ipun>	kk ill look into this
Apr 26 09:53:30 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95705/ this is not OK
Apr 26 09:54:07 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hey
Apr 26 09:54:10 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 26 09:54:22 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, it only prints stack trace afaik
Apr 26 09:54:43 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what is the issue?
Apr 26 09:55:16 <akurtakov>	the code should be modified so EMBEDDED is a no_op on wayland
Apr 26 09:55:37 <lufimtse>	no_op?
Apr 26 09:55:46 <lufimtse>	I guess I should've added you as reviewer on that one
Apr 26 09:56:09 <lufimtse>	what is no_op?
Apr 26 09:56:15 <akurtakov>	no operation
Apr 26 09:56:31 <akurtakov>	aka do nothing if not x11 and style embedded
Apr 26 09:57:45 <akurtakov>	http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/no-op-no-operation
Apr 26 09:59:13 <lufimtse>	You mean skip and not print anything?
Apr 26 09:59:32 <lufimtse>	You mean no error, just silently skip?
Apr 26 09:59:57 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Apr 26 10:00:08 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: yes
Apr 26 10:00:22 <akurtakov>	with comment in the code
Apr 26 10:00:28 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, well, what about users who are trying to embed elements with SWT on wayland and have no idea why it doesn't work.
Apr 26 10:00:41 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, shouldn't we suggest something to them?
Apr 26 10:01:02 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what's the logic behind silent skipping, why?
Apr 26 10:01:18 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, afterall, gtk throws warnings if we do something wrong as well.
Apr 26 10:01:38 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: this is how swt behaves
Apr 26 10:02:03 <akurtakov>	there was no gesture support and swt was silently skipping someone using the gesture api
Apr 26 10:02:16 <akurtakov>	provide as much as possible without bail out
Apr 26 10:02:38 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, But we have things like "no more callbacks" error warning, which has proven to be very useful.
Apr 26 10:02:48 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what's the issue with having a warnings?
Apr 26 10:03:14 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, silent skip makes it hard to figure out why things don't work.
Apr 26 10:03:20 <akurtakov>	issue is you will step everything else from working in this case for no reason as we know it's not working
Apr 26 10:03:37 <akurtakov>	while in the no more callback case its unrecoverable
Apr 26 10:04:09 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, no, a warning doesn't stop everything else from working.
Apr 26 10:04:15 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, it's just a warning.
Apr 26 10:04:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the patch doesn't terminate operation
Apr 26 10:04:38 <lufimtse>	afaik
Apr 26 10:05:02 <akurtakov>	ah, it's not throwing it
Apr 26 10:05:05 <akurtakov>	so it really does nothing
Apr 26 10:05:42 <lufimtse>	yep
Apr 26 10:05:46 <lufimtse>	just prints stacktrace
Apr 26 10:05:51 <lufimtse>	and continues
Apr 26 10:06:11 <akurtakov>	it should be wrapped up in if DEBUG in this case
Apr 26 10:06:22 <lufimtse>	we have a debug flag?
Apr 26 10:07:23 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: Device.DEBUG
Apr 26 10:07:49 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, interesting, let me check
Apr 26 10:09:00 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: if you download http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/I20170425-2000/download.php?dropFile=swt-I20170425-2000-gtk-linux-x86_64.zip
Apr 26 10:09:11 <akurtakov>	you would even see two swt jars
Apr 26 10:09:18 <akurtakov>	one with debug on and one off
Apr 26 10:10:22 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, interesting
Apr 26 10:11:44 <akurtakov>	this is not the only thing
Apr 26 10:12:17 <akurtakov>	actually it would be nice if Device.DEBUG is bound to env variable
Apr 26 10:12:47 <akurtakov>	and set to true if variable set but I never got to it
Apr 26 10:12:51 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 26 10:15:09 <akurtakov>	Device.init() should set it to env variable if set
Apr 26 10:15:22 <akurtakov>	as this is not user visible it has always been very low prio to me
Apr 26 10:19:17 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: in short : a lot of room for improvement again :)
Apr 26 10:20:11 <akurtakov>	and sorry for missing the fact you're not actually throwing the exception
Apr 26 10:20:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah
Apr 26 10:20:46 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, thanks for pointing out DEBUG flag.
Apr 26 10:20:54 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, let me investigate and see if we can update Ian's patch
Apr 26 10:21:09 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I find discussions very constructive :-)
Apr 26 10:21:12 <akurtakov>	just do a follow up commit wrapping it
Apr 26 10:22:05 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok. Btw, do you know how the DEBUG flag is set by the swt.debug.jar in compiliation?
Apr 26 10:22:34 <akurtakov>	don't remember or maybe I mix it up with debug info?
Apr 26 10:22:40 <akurtakov>	meh, such a mess
Apr 26 10:23:05 <akurtakov>	for the build I mean
Apr 26 10:23:14 <akurtakov>	Inever liked the idea of 2 jars tbh
Apr 26 10:23:29 <lufimtse>	I found this guy https://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#debugmode
Apr 26 10:29:53 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: btw, I just found http://git.net/ml/commits.gnome/2016-10/msg01931.html
Apr 26 10:30:26 <akurtakov>	ipun: looks like it's not in progress anymore ?
Apr 26 10:31:34 <lufimtse>	:-/
Apr 26 10:33:02 <akurtakov>	how is GtkGLArea doing it ?
Apr 26 10:35:44 <ipun>	akurtakov: yeah it doesnt look like it
Apr 26 10:44:23 <ipun>	lufimtse: would   if (Device.DEBUG && !OS.isX11()) be suffieicent or did you think nesting it would be more legible?
Apr 26 10:44:59 <ipun>	nesting it might be better for future development if there does happen to be support later (if ever)
Apr 26 10:53:29 <lufimtse>	ipun, the above would still create a socket on wayland
Apr 26 10:53:46 <lufimtse>	ipun, what you want is not create a socket on wayland, but also print msg if Device.DEBUG is set.
Apr 26 10:53:54 <ipun>	ah right sorry
Apr 26 10:54:02 <ipun>	i figured my logic was flawed
Apr 26 15:21:26 <ipun>	ericwill:  https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95495/
Apr 27 11:58:47 <ipun>	akurtakov: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=781845
Apr 27 11:58:54 <ipun>	now we wait
Apr 27 11:59:57 <akurtakov>	ipun: so we should get your patch in ?
Apr 27 12:00:08 <akurtakov>	it would at least make it not close imediately
Apr 27 12:00:16 <ipun>	akurtakov: yes the patch i have is independent of that issue
Apr 27 12:00:25 <ipun>	i split the bug up into two earlier i think
Apr 27 12:00:26 <akurtakov>	is the alt-tab issue fixed?
Apr 27 12:00:53 <ipun>	the alt-tab issue is actually related to the gtk bug
Apr 27 12:01:17 <akurtakov>	to this one ?
Apr 27 12:01:22 <ipun>	yeah
Apr 27 12:01:34 <ipun>	its caused by the popup not having focus immediately as intended
Apr 27 12:01:47 <akurtakov>	thus no focus lost on which it's closed ?
Apr 27 12:01:52 <ipun>	so when you alt tab out the signal that launchbar checks for doesnt receive
Apr 27 12:01:55 <ipun>	yes pretty much
Apr 27 12:02:05 <akurtakov>	I see
Apr 27 12:02:12 <ipun>	theres a few ways the popup is closed, and thats one of the ways
Apr 27 12:02:29 <akurtakov>	ipun: would you please contact the gtk guys on irc for their opinion ?
Apr 27 12:02:33 <ipun>	give me a moment to fix up the patch so i can isolate it 
Apr 27 12:02:37 <ipun>	akurtakov: i have, no resp
Apr 27 12:02:42 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 27 12:02:47 <ipun>	ive been grilling them for the past week about it
Apr 27 12:03:06 <ipun>	their recommendation of using popover is not feasible
Apr 27 12:12:07 <ipun>	wow akurtakov that was the quickest rebase from you ive ever seen (unless that was automated)
Apr 27 12:12:43 <akurtakov>	if I only knew how to automate that :)
Apr 27 12:31:58 <ipun>	akurtakov: i ran tests on it and it hasnt caused any additional test errors so it is ready for review
Apr 27 14:41:11 <ipun>	ericwill: even worse is that GridLayout is shared amongst all platforms
Apr 27 14:42:56 <ipun>	i think were going to need to figure out how to get the correct width in GridLayout.java | line 670
Apr 27 14:43:27 <ericwill>	ah yes, I remember this guy
Apr 27 14:43:31 <ericwill>	what a messy method
Apr 27 14:43:54 <ipun>	its likely this might be more then just one layout
Apr 27 15:03:13 <ipun>	lufimtse: im having a bit of trouble building old versiosn of SWT. Im just running build.sh but its saying "No rule to make target 'gnome.c', needed by 'gnome.o'.". Seen this before?
Apr 27 15:53:08 <akurtakov>	ipun: so the issue comes from https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/diff/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse%20SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/graphics/TextLayout.java?id=3b55f60471b210ca4631c9c97fbf4ec77086b0b3 ?
Apr 27 15:54:31 <ipun>	akurtakov: might be, the commits pretty big but i think thats probably hte most relevant one
Apr 27 16:30:32 <ipun>	akurtakov: yup its that exact block
Apr 28 10:15:31 <ipun>	akurtakov: regarding the regression caused by https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=491712 , if i run my eclipse instance in GDK_DPI_SCALE=1.5 , does that mean my junits will also inherit that?
Apr 28 10:16:03 <ipun>	so far my fix hasnt caused any additional junit errors relating to the one it was there to initially fix
Apr 28 10:16:11 <akurtakov>	ipun: just to be sure add it to the junit launchers too :)
Apr 28 10:16:26 <ipun>	akurtakov: yeah i did that too
Apr 28 10:16:34 <akurtakov>	ipun: they should 
Apr 28 10:16:46 <ipun>	okay
Apr 28 10:16:59 <ipun>	let me wrap this up a bit  better and explain my changes
Apr 28 10:41:45 <ipun>	akurtakov: ignore the commit i think i screwd up my commit and it included some other changes
Apr 28 10:42:56 <ipun>	k i think i fixed it
Apr 28 11:01:47 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: please review as I would not have time for it today
Apr 28 11:11:50 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, k
Apr 28 11:11:59 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, is it ok for me to do on monday?
Apr 28 11:12:06 <lufimtse>	was trying to get a few api related things in today.
Apr 28 11:12:22 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: what api ?
Apr 28 11:12:37 <akurtakov>	there are zero chances for new API being added now
Apr 28 11:16:13 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ok, I'll review 
Apr 28 11:16:21 <akurtakov>	ipun: link please
Apr 28 11:16:38 <ipun>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/96039/
Apr 28 11:16:43 <ipun>	akurtakov ^
Apr 28 11:16:54 <akurtakov>	ipun: on it
Apr 28 11:16:58 <ipun>	thanks!
Apr 28 11:19:57 <akurtakov>	ipun: you used bisect to find the commit in question right ?
Apr 28 11:20:16 <akurtakov>	I'm curios how much time this took you
Apr 28 11:22:35 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: so what api do you speak of ?
Apr 28 11:22:50 <lufimtse>	the HOVER_ color stuff
Apr 28 11:22:58 <lufimtse>	kinda been tinkering with the color stuff
Apr 28 11:23:03 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Apr 28 11:23:38 <akurtakov>	rebuild everything
Apr 28 11:25:31 <ipun>	akurtakov: yes i did
Apr 28 11:25:40 <ipun>	surprisingly not that long
Apr 28 11:26:03 <ipun>	i wrote a script that rebuilds swt and moves the binaries while cleaning everything beforehand
Apr 28 11:26:16 <ipun>	rebuildling SWT is a lot quicker than gtk
Apr 28 11:26:44 <akurtakov>	ipun: yeah, but a rough number would help me get some expectations
Apr 28 11:26:49 <akurtakov>	I have never used it so far
Apr 28 11:27:25 <ipun>	akurtakov: id say about 25-30 mins for the 11 bisects
Apr 28 11:27:35 <akurtakov>	not bad
Apr 28 11:27:42 <akurtakov>	thanks for the info
Apr 28 11:27:46 <ipun>	no problerm
Apr 28 11:27:57 <ipun>	i did an hour or so of trying to figure it out myself
Apr 28 11:28:26 <ipun>	it was kind of a last choice, but i realised this would be much quicker than bisecting gtk
Apr 28 11:29:01 <ipun>	also akurtakov i had a bit of help from the comments since he gave me a pretty good estimate of inbetween what versions did it pass/fail

May 04 09:18:13 <akurtakov>	that's a real adventure
May 04 09:18:31 <akurtakov>	how do you debug smth that doesn't happen on your machine and you can't replicate it locally
May 04 09:19:00 <akurtakov>	it's impossible to test smth without dbus on systemd booted distro :)
May 04 09:20:39 <ipun>	jeez thats brutal
May 04 10:28:18 <ipun>	akurtakov: have you happened to have reviewed this? https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95925/
May 04 10:28:41 <ipun>	i got a full fix for the launch bar sorta ready, but might need some of your intuition. Needs this patch first in order to do the full fix

May 08 12:24:49 <ipun>	this bug is not fixable
May 08 12:24:57 <ipun>	just got word from mclassen
May 08 12:24:57 <lufimtse>	ipun, hmmm
May 08 12:25:26 <ipun>	lufimtse: it makes sense though 
May 08 12:25:50 <ipun>	because a toplevel gtk_window can move very far away from another top_level window, how are you going to return the coodinates to that?
May 08 12:26:06 <ipun>	theres no "net" that holds the two together within a range
May 08 12:28:25 <lufimtse>	hmmm
May 08 12:30:04 <ipun>	lufimtse: it only works with SWT.ON_TOP
May 08 12:30:16 <ipun>	which basically maps it to the shell
May 08 12:31:50 <lufimtse>	why with swt.ON_TOP ?
May 08 12:31:56 <lufimtse>	why does it work with?
May 08 12:32:07 <lufimtse>	internet seems down..
May 08 12:32:09 <lufimtse>	meh?

May 09 11:13:38 <ipun>	thanks!
May 09 11:15:19 <lufimtse>	ipun, did you run jUnits for this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95925/
May 09 11:19:53 <ipun>	lufimtse: i believe i did, ill run it again 
May 09 11:22:03 <ipun>	lufimtse: okay yes i did. I do remember doing so. And also this is barred off with !OS.isX11() so it would only affect the junit of 3.20+
May 09 11:23:07 <lufimtse>	yea, only wayland jUnits are interesting.
May 09 11:25:06 <ipun>	lufimtse: updated the commit message

May 09 11:32:16 <akurtakov>	Tuesday: All-day test pass. Nobody should develop or fix anything. Literally spend the entire day testing.
May 09 11:33:36 <akurtakov>	the endgame is pretty heavy process and requires everyone to keep an eye to the process
May 09 11:34:28 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, my bad
May 09 11:34:33 <lufimtse>	I forgot
May 09 11:34:46 <lufimtse>	I read that before, but forgot about it. I should add that to my calendar.
May 09 11:34:49 <lufimtse>	soz.

May 11 10:42:24 <ipun>	lufimtse: so the logic behind having a absolute coordinate scheme so that we can "save" shell positions when exiting eclipse/starting eclipse is met by "no. Wayland does not support that functionality"
May 11 10:44:23 <lufimtse>	hmm
May 11 10:45:13 <lufimtse>	ipun, meh. I guess best we can do is make sure the most vital things of Eclipse work on Wayland, and then see if we can fix up platform.ui elements to adjust accordingly.
May 11 10:45:20 <lufimtse>	like take out the hacky logic in launchbar maybe etc...
May 11 10:45:38 <lufimtse>	if we're hitting walls with Wayland, then we should maybe try to make the best of what we can.

May 18 10:44:43 <ipun>	akurtakov: i might. I tried out a ton of variations on how to fix this issue with the keyboard focus in wayland and Ive come to it that the logic cant be put the else line in line 591:Shell.java
May 18 10:45:18 <akurtakov>	ipun: have you identified place where it can be put ?
May 18 10:48:10 <ipun>	akurtakov: it can be put in setVisible
May 18 10:48:33 <akurtakov>	hmm ok
May 18 10:48:45 <ipun>	ive put it up for review; im trying to figure out a better solution instead of traversing the shell to see if it has editable fields
May 18 10:48:53 <ipun>	i've asked GTK for help, im just waiting on that now
May 18 10:49:01 <akurtakov>	or maybe you can hook it into some gtk signal
May 18 10:50:31 <ipun>	akurtakov: i've been told it needs to be done before gtk_show
May 18 10:51:10 <akurtakov>	ok
May 18 10:51:53 <ipun>	akurtakov: im wondering if its possible to capture the show singal before its sent, otherwise we might have to put it there
May 18 10:51:59 <ipun>	there as in setVisible
May 18 10:52:23 <ipun>	the only small issue is the traversal method. Its using DFS but i dont think its the most "viable" solution
May 18 10:52:33 <ipun>	it works the way its intended to though!

May 18 15:10:18 <ipun>	i think we have a queens uni student from 5 years ago
May 18 15:10:29 <ipun>	Lukas Berk is from Queens hes on perf tools
May 18 15:11:27 <ipun>	hmmm
May 18 15:11:30 <akurtakov>	ah, I know Lukas but I was speaking for the team
May 18 15:11:32 <ipun>	this actually looks like a really cool project
May 18 15:11:40 <ipun>	ah yes, definitely for the team
May 18 15:12:00 <akurtakov>	lberk did the stap-java stuff IIRC
May 18 15:13:22 <ipun>	yeah he did, just spoke with him haha
May 18 15:13:32 <ipun>	coincidentally just happened to be working on something next to me
May 18 15:14:14 <akurtakov>	bed time, ttyt
May 19 11:31:15 <ipun>	akurtakov: who maintains JDT atm?
May 19 11:31:27 *	ipun has some complaints/suggestions
May 19 11:32:05 <akurtakov>	ipun: please open bugs, the jdt guys are hard to work with :)
May 19 11:32:17 <akurtakov>	and really strong on following procedures
May 19 11:32:58 <ipun>	akurtakov: ah i see. Had this chat with Angel from the Che team about a similar issue that Intellij was able to solve
May 19 11:33:11 <ipun>	i will see if they already have a report on it 
May 19 11:33:50 <akurtakov>	what was that ?
May 19 11:34:30 <akurtakov>	ipun: fwiw, there are really important things which we will probably have someone to work on (eventually, probably not this year) :)
May 19 11:34:49 <akurtakov>	but our editor shouldn't be worse in any single topic
May 19 11:36:37 <ipun>	akurtakov: this use case: im typing a method within an object and use ctrl+space to see the autocompletions. I happen to select foo(int a, int b). After selection the brackets are automatically created and i can start adding in my parameters
May 19 11:36:49 <ipun>	say i later realise "oh, i actually meant another method
May 19 11:37:10 <ipun>	so i click at object.foo(a,b) at the end of foo
May 19 11:37:36 <ipun>	and do ctrl+space. I found the proper method called foo2(int a, int b) and select that
May 19 11:38:11 <ipun>	what ends up happening is the editor fills it in like so: object.foo2(___, ___)foo(a,b);
May 19 11:39:31 <ipun>	i had a chat with Jeff about it too, and i think its fair that if both foo and foo2 have the same template param name and object type, it should be asummed that the arguments from foo() are safe to be moved to foo2()
May 19 11:40:00 <akurtakov>	try doing the autocomplete while having ctrl hit
May 19 11:40:08 <akurtakov>	this enables autocomplete overrides
May 19 11:40:18 <akurtakov>	instead of the default autocomplete inserts
May 19 11:40:58 <akurtakov>	ipun: works for you ?
May 19 11:41:57 <ipun>	wow
May 19 11:41:58 <ipun>	it does
May 19 11:42:04 <ipun>	akurtakov: thanks i didnt know that
May 19 11:42:19 <akurtakov>	ipun: you're welcome :)
May 19 11:42:58 <akurtakov>	one thing to send mail to Sopot to tweet from his account as a hint
May 19 11:42:59 <akurtakov>	thanks
May 19 11:43:30 <akurtakov>	we are always looking for content for https://twitter.com/EclipseJavaIDE
May 19 11:45:04 <akurtakov>	ipun: sent to him already :)
May 19 11:45:24 <akurtakov>	how does intellij does it ?
May 19 11:45:30 <akurtakov>	is it easier to find it out ?
May 19 11:46:54 <akurtakov>	does it satisfy your need? I mean is Intellij doing smth else ?
May 19 11:52:33 <ipun>	akurtakov: let me ask 
May 19 11:52:38 <ipun>	some of my coworkers use intellij
May 19 11:52:40 <akurtakov>	https://twitter.com/EclipseJavaIDE/status/849957500241666048
May 19 11:55:22 <akurtakov>	I don't mind netbeans at all
May 19 11:56:06 <akurtakov>	but somehow intellij in my eyes is much like macos - marketing products mostly
May 19 11:56:33 <akurtakov>	I mean all the "benefits" come from better marketing
May 19 11:57:46 <ipun>	akurtakov: okay so i just played around with intellij in regards to what we discussed with a coworker
May 19 11:57:56 <ipun>	basically you dont need to hold ctrl
May 19 11:58:00 <ipun>	it just does it automatically
May 19 11:58:16 <akurtakov>	you can get that in eclipse too
May 19 11:58:32 <akurtakov>	go to Preferences/Java/Content Assist
May 19 11:59:00 <akurtakov>	and switch completion inserts to completion overrides radio
May 19 11:59:15 <akurtakov>	should we make this default is probably a valid question
May 19 11:59:25 <ipun>	oh my gosh
May 19 11:59:34 <ipun>	this definteily should be defaulted
May 19 12:00:46 <akurtakov>	feel free to open bug for that
May 19 12:06:02 <ipun>	akurtakov: okay 
May 19 12:06:20 <ipun>	i just talked to lucas about it too, hes going through vogellas tutorial and even hes like "why is this not defaulted"

May 31 10:59:32 <lufimtse>	ipun, thank you.
May 31 11:31:04 <ericwill>	lufimtse GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark
Jun 01 10:17:00 <ipun>	akurtakov: regarding the swt shell it looks like all wayland shells cant go beyond 110px for some reason
Jun 01 10:17:09 <ipun>	tested it in gtk3-demo
Jun 01 10:17:19 <ipun>	asked on GTK channel no response
Jun 01 10:44:48 <akurtakov>	what do you mean ?
Jun 01 10:45:00 <akurtakov>	eclipse is way biiger than 110px
Jun 01 10:46:39 <ipun>	akurtakov: sorry i mean the other way around
Jun 01 10:47:03 <ipun>	the window has trouble going smaller than 110px width
Jun 01 10:48:20 <ipun>	try running gtk3-demo-> gestures. In x11 you can make it so small its basically 1x1 size
Jun 01 10:48:59 <ipun>	but in wayland there is a minimum width
Jun 01 10:49:17 <ipun>	very annoying, not documented either
Jun 01 10:50:29 <akurtakov>	ipun: regarding https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/98447/
Jun 01 10:50:39 <akurtakov>	my gut feeling is this is recipe for disaster
Jun 01 10:50:59 <ipun>	akurtakov: having the async call?
Jun 01 10:51:19 <akurtakov>	yes, you can  end up with endless cycle
Jun 01 10:52:11 <akurtakov>	as if you do it async it could cause new gtk_changed signal 
Jun 01 10:52:27 <akurtakov>	which would post new async java event and etc.
Jun 01 10:52:48 <ipun>	hmmm...
Jun 01 10:52:50 <akurtakov>	it would depend on the amount of events in the gtk queue whether this would happen or not
Jun 01 10:53:24 <akurtakov>	and whether you have slow enough event handler somewhre 
Jun 01 10:55:03 <ipun>	okay ill try to find a better way
Jun 01 10:55:07 <ipun>	i see your point 
Jun 01 10:56:22 <ipun>	do you have any suggestions of another possible solution?
Jun 01 10:56:41 <akurtakov>	probably bug in gtk_commit logic
Jun 01 11:01:07 <akurtakov>	or in some other handler
Jun 01 11:01:44 <ipun>	kk
Jun 01 11:08:09 <akurtakov>	my first idea is that the whole if not needed
Jun 01 11:08:39 <akurtakov>	but it needs deeper testng
Jun 01 11:09:19 <ipun>	doesnt seem to be a problem in gtk2
Jun 01 11:09:42 <ipun>	you're right though im pretty sure this was left behind from 1.x days as this is forcing a manual update
Jun 01 11:09:43 <akurtakov>	yup
Jun 01 11:09:58 <akurtakov>	I have to run now but will take a look tomorrow
Jun 01 11:10:03 <ipun>	okay sounds good
Jun 01 11:10:05 <ipun>	thanks for the help! :)
Jun 01 11:10:13 <ipun>	wouldnt have thought to remove it
Jun 01 11:11:11 <akurtakov>	one should never make 2 eventloops interfere :)
Jun 01 11:11:21 <akurtakov>	this is what troubled me
Jun 01 11:16:54 <akurtakov>	and after that it's a matter of reading the docs
Jun 01 11:17:39 <akurtakov>	and the docs for the function say it's for "manual" so my thought was so this shouldn't happen in response to signal and removed it
Jun 01 11:17:41 <akurtakov>	hope that helps
Jun 01 11:21:23 <ipun>	yes it does, thanks akurtakov !
Jun 01 11:21:51 <ipun>	so far all junits have passed and running hte snippet works fine, so ill do some more testing within a child eclipse
Jun 01 11:21:54 <ipun>	but its looking good

Jun 06 14:50:16 <ericwill>	so nothing super crazy? :P
Jun 06 14:50:21 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, when are the builds back up?
Jun 06 14:50:32 <akurtakov>	well, if you're going to commit smth 
Jun 06 14:50:42 <akurtakov>	that would require natives rebuild you would better wait
Jun 06 14:50:49 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: once RC4 is out
Jun 06 14:51:40 <akurtakov>	and me and/or Sravan are back from vacation as noone else will work on that AFAIK
Jun 06 14:52:10 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay, good to know :)
Jun 08 10:41:42 <ericwill>	akurtakov when someone switches to the dark theme on GTK, do we set the GTK theme to Adwaita-dark?
Jun 08 10:41:48 <ericwill>	I think I asked you this before but I can't remember :)

Jun 08 14:55:06 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay thanks
Jun 09 10:20:46 <ericwill>	akurtakov hey, if I wanted to merge some small patches am I all clear to go? or do I need to bump a version somewhere?
Jun 09 10:32:00 <akurtakov>	ericwill: you can merge it
Jun 09 10:32:15 <akurtakov>	and bump the swt version like x.y.z+100
Jun 09 10:32:24 <akurtakov>	assuming you're not adding new functionality
Jun 09 10:32:40 <akurtakov>	note that there will be no build
Jun 09 10:32:55 <akurtakov>	for now 
Jun 09 10:33:10 <akurtakov>	although Sravan is wokring on it and hopefully he will be able to get them running today
Jun 09 10:33:14 <ericwill>	akurtakov :)
Jun 09 10:37:56 <ericwill>	akurtakov how do I bump the version, never done that before
Jun 09 10:38:20 <akurtakov>	increase the version in the Manifest.mf and pom.xml
Jun 09 10:38:24 <akurtakov>	that's it
Jun 09 10:39:42 <ericwill>	3.106.0 becomes 3.107.0?
Jun 09 10:40:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: no
Jun 09 10:40:27 <akurtakov>	3.106.0 becomese 3.106.100
Jun 09 10:41:04 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#Guidelines_on_versioning_plug-ins
Jun 09 10:41:33 <akurtakov>	if/when we add new API or we change BREE it will become 107
Jun 09 10:41:53 <akurtakov>	ericwill: note that you have to do it for fragments too 
Jun 09 10:41:55 <akurtakov>	e.g. http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.binaries.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
Jun 09 10:43:43 <ericwill>	akurtakov do I have to do it for that fragment even if I make no change to OS.java?
Jun 09 10:44:05 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yes, swt fragments always keep same version
Jun 09 10:44:15 <akurtakov>	as they are actually containing the java code too
Jun 09 10:44:38 <akurtakov>	org.eclipse.swt host is just an empty shell
Jun 09 10:53:01 <ericwill>	akurtakov like this? https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/98369/
Jun 09 10:53:07 <ericwill>	and https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/99030/
Jun 09 10:53:58 <akurtakov>	ericwill: 1. is ok
Jun 09 10:54:01 <akurtakov>	2 is not
Jun 09 10:54:08 <akurtakov>	you have to do for all fragments :)
Jun 09 10:54:55 <ericwill>	ah, all platforms
Jun 09 11:06:28 <ericwill>	akurtakov for the binaries, build.xml stays untouched right? or also gets bumped?
Jun 09 11:06:50 <akurtakov>	there is no version in build.xml, right?
Jun 09 11:09:22 <ericwill>	there is <property name="version.suffix" value="3.106.0" />
Jun 09 11:09:41 <akurtakov>	so change it there too :)
Jun 09 11:17:18 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ipun: see my comment for the spin button change
Jun 09 11:17:54 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, where?

Jun 09 11:19:18 <akurtakov>	done now
Jun 09 11:24:28 <ericwill>	akurtakov should I file a bug for the version bump?
Jun 09 11:24:45 <akurtakov>	just use the one you will push the change with
Jun 09 11:28:26 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay added
Jun 09 11:28:57 <ericwill>	for the change in SWT, I should bump org.eclipse.swt.examples etc. as well, right?
Jun 09 11:44:56 <ericwill>	akurtakov can I merge my other change now?
Jun 09 11:45:15 <akurtakov>	ericwill: go on
Jun 09 11:45:25 <akurtakov>	no need to bump other bundles
Jun 09 11:45:35 <akurtakov>	they will be bumped on changes in them 
Jun 09 11:49:50 <ericwill>	akurtakov ok, change is in
Jun 09 11:49:55 <ericwill>	for SWT
Jun 09 11:50:41 <akurtakov>	ericwill: push the binaries change too
Jun 09 11:51:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, this is good candidate for backport too

Jun 20 10:09:24 <ipun>	ericwill: no we decided on GdkEventButton
Jun 20 10:09:38 <ipun>	the problem with using a generic GdkEvent(Any) is that there isnt a memmove for that
Jun 20 10:09:57 <ipun>	thats not hard to implement, but I think its better just to do it this way and keep it as a real Gdk Signal

Jun 20 10:13:07 <ipun>	we acted needed a few more attributes in the signal that GdkEventButton has
Jun 20 10:13:25 <ericwill>	that's fine, I was just curious since Leo commented about it yesterday
Jun 20 10:13:26 <ericwill>	+2 from me
Jun 20 10:14:05 <ericwill>	ipun what is your github username
Jun 20 10:14:10 <ericwill>	going to add you to the snippets repo
Jun 20 10:14:12 <ipun>	ericwill: itpun
Jun 20 10:14:20 <ericwill>	kk
Jun 20 10:14:25 <ericwill>	please upload any snippets you have
Jun 20 10:14:30 <ipun>	sure
Jun 20 10:15:11 <ericwill>	https://github.com/ericwill/SWT-snippets
Jun 20 10:15:13 <ericwill>	invite sent
Jun 20 10:29:44 <akurtakov>	ericwill: you mentioned 85% of the warnings fixed
Jun 20 10:29:48 <akurtakov>	is this in master already ?
Jun 20 10:36:50 <ericwill>	akurtakov no
Jun 20 10:36:54 <ericwill>	it's a native change
Jun 20 10:36:58 <ericwill>	can't merge it yet
Jun 20 10:37:08 <akurtakov>	not ready or relen limitation ?
Jun 20 10:37:20 <ericwill>	it's ready
Jun 20 10:37:25 <ericwill>	but I thought the builds aren't ready yet
Jun 20 10:53:38 <akurtakov>	ericwill: should be fine to push now
Jun 20 10:54:52 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay, this is good :) because I have some patches in the queue that have OS.java changes
Jun 20 10:55:09 <akurtakov>	ericwill: please push, the first native build was yesterday
Jun 20 10:55:32 <akurtakov>	and I'm back so I can handle the releng changes if needed
Jun 20 10:55:59 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay will do
Jun 20 11:00:27 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hpux should die :)
Jun 20 11:21:39 <ipun>	lufimtse: could you take a look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/98030/ when you are free?
Jun 20 11:21:53 <lufimtse>	hey
Jun 20 11:21:55 <lufimtse>	lemme see
Jun 20 12:01:51 <akurtakov>	ipun: lufimtse: can you point to the jdt bug refactoring bug where table viewer doesn't enter edit mode?
Jun 20 12:06:32 <akurtakov>	I used it as an example why using deprecated code hurts us
Jun 20 12:06:32 <akurtakov>	and now I need to make proposal what does JDT UI needs to change to 
Jun 20 12:06:32 <ipun>	akurtakov: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=510803
Jun 20 12:06:32 <akurtakov>	as I claimed non-deprecated viewer works
Jun 20 12:06:32 <akurtakov>	ipun: can we make a proposal to jdt.ui to change their code to make it works
Jun 20 12:06:32 <akurtakov>	as IIRC the normal table viewer works
Jun 20 12:08:43 <ipun>	akurtakov: yeah sure. Should the proposal be made on that bug or should I do it as a new bug report on the JDT UI
Jun 20 12:09:18 <akurtakov>	ipun: please let it be new for JDT UI
Jun 20 12:09:54 <akurtakov>	if you can come up with patch that just makes it work by not using deprecated stuff - that would be perfect 
Jun 20 12:10:02 <akurtakov>	I would be able to make Dani shut up :0
Jun 20 12:26:29 <akurtakov>	ipun: so do you think this is feasible to be done in few days?
Jun 20 12:26:55 <akurtakov>	aka feel free to go wild and use JFace stuff directly without caring about JDT UI internal implementations
Jun 20 13:57:20 <ipun>	akurtakov: i can try, ill see what i can do
Jun 20 13:57:46 <ipun>	its been pretty embeded to what has been built, but i don't see a problem with trying to fix this with a newer way
Jun 20 14:00:52 <ipun>	akurtakov: ill let you know once I can give you a better estimate in time
Jun 20 14:28:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hey
Jun 20 14:29:56 <lufimtse>	I'm not exactly sure about the above, but the issue is not in the deprecated viewer, but in SWT somewhere.
Jun 20 14:30:07 <lufimtse>	The same thing can occur on a non-deprecated viewer just as likley.
Jun 20 14:30:12 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Jun 20 14:30:37 <lufimtse>	That bug is on my todo list, will get to it eventually :-)
Jun 20 14:36:49 <ipun>	yeah i just looked at it i forgot that was the issue
Jun 20 14:36:54 <ipun>	something to do with children of a tab folder right?
Jun 20 14:44:35 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I know it's an issue in swt
Jun 20 14:45:09 <akurtakov>	but what i remember is Ian not being able to reproduce it with plain Jface viewer
Jun 20 14:45:22 <lufimtse>	that's because plain viewer didn't use a tabfolder
Jun 20 14:45:24 <lufimtse>	I think
Jun 20 14:45:43 <lufimtse>	but any non-deprecated viewer that uses tabfolder will have the same trouble.
Jun 20 14:45:59 <lufimtse>	Like, the viewer being deprecated is not the issue per-se.
Jun 20 14:46:30 <lufimtse>	if that makes sense.... akurtakov 
Jun 20 14:46:35 <akurtakov>	damn, I needed an example how bad it is that jdt ui to use 
Jun 20 14:46:40 <akurtakov>	deprecated
Jun 20 14:46:47 <lufimtse>	hmmmm
Jun 20 14:46:49 <lufimtse>	I see
Jun 20 14:46:56 <lufimtse>	What's the context?
Jun 20 14:47:27 <akurtakov>	look at it from my pov, I want to push some reasoning in jdt guys that they should start updating their codebase to modernize it
Jun 20 14:47:55 <lufimtse>	I see.
Jun 20 14:48:00 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/PMC
Jun 20 14:48:09 <akurtakov>	we had a heated discussion today
Jun 20 14:48:44 <lufimtse>	I recall fixing a memory leak that was due to a resource not being closed. This could have been detected if newer java interface was used that automatically detects unclosed resources..
Jun 20 14:49:12 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: fwiw, there was a way to follow gerrits for given project
Jun 20 14:49:31 <akurtakov>	that would be easier than others remembering to add you as reviewer
Jun 20 14:49:49 <akurtakov>	I remember I did that myself some years ago but not how :)
Jun 20 14:49:59 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, that's true. I do that. But I can't stop merges in time sometimes X-D
Jun 20 14:50:32 <akurtakov>	well, don't become next Markus
Jun 20 14:50:40 <akurtakov>	if we can improve it later so be it
Jun 20 14:51:05 <akurtakov>	it is really discourages for others if their patch end up in lenghty discussions
Jun 20 14:51:44 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I like Markus :-)
Jun 20 14:51:44 <akurtakov>	it's a really sharp edge between teaching someone and discouraging him
Jun 20 14:51:51 <lufimtse>	but I see your point.
Jun 20 14:52:28 <akurtakov>	while I like his technical expertise and etc.
Jun 20 14:52:34 <lufimtse>	that's true, but sometimes it helps to prevent obvious mistakes as cleaning up later can be more pain. Ex adding api too early...
Jun 20 14:52:41 <akurtakov>	I really hate the fact that he discouraged many many people from contributing to eclipse
Jun 20 14:52:51 <lufimtse>	I see
Jun 20 14:53:15 <akurtakov>	this is long term vs mid term
Jun 20 14:53:37 <akurtakov>	mid term it's best to have the best tech solution we can achieve now
Jun 20 14:54:05 <akurtakov>	long term it's best to gave a number vibrant community
Jun 20 14:55:01 <akurtakov>	today's call was double the usual time
Jun 20 14:55:13 <akurtakov>	as we obviously have to change a lot in how we welcome people
Jun 20 14:55:22 <lufimtse>	I see
Jun 20 14:55:40 <akurtakov>	aka it's normal to have way higher expectation to patches depending on whom they come from
Jun 20 14:55:53 <akurtakov>	aka I can nitpick on patches coming from you
Jun 20 14:56:07 <akurtakov>	as you know there is nothing bad in my intention already
Jun 20 14:56:27 <akurtakov>	while there is no way we know how a random person trying to contribut will get it
Jun 20 14:56:58 <lufimtse>	I see. So be picky with friends and co-workers, but be easy on new commers.
Jun 20 14:56:59 <akurtakov>	so it's most probably more encouraging to accept his change after fixing obvious mistakes
Jun 20 14:57:18 <akurtakov>	and do the details in consequent changes
Jun 20 14:57:34 <akurtakov>	of course there is no silver bullet
Jun 20 14:57:36 <lufimtse>	Interesting.
Jun 20 14:57:43 <lufimtse>	That's an interesting thought there.
Jun 20 14:57:51 <lufimtse>	We should add to Open Organisation book.
Jun 20 14:59:00 <akurtakov>	it's a really big discussion 
Jun 20 14:59:17 <akurtakov>	and we need to act to try encouraging more people to contribute back
Jun 20 14:59:39 <akurtakov>	although whatever path we try it's a guess
Jun 20 14:59:54 <akurtakov>	but one thing is sure current path leads to less contributors
Jun 20 15:00:26 <akurtakov>	if there are ideas about how to make it more atractive for people to contribute I'm all ears 
Jun 20 15:00:37 <akurtakov>	look at it as brainstorming
Jun 20 15:00:58 <akurtakov>	it might be totally discarded or morph into smth different
Jun 20 15:01:13 <akurtakov>	or accepted warmly
Jun 20 15:01:26 <akurtakov>	no one really knows more than - change is needed
Jun 20 15:04:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov a good way is to get university students involved with contributing. it's a good learning experience for them and it builds experience for their resume. and we benefit from the contributions :)
Jun 20 15:08:31 <akurtakov>	ericwill: how do you propose this to happen?
Jun 20 15:09:28 <ericwill>	akurtakov encourage the foundation to go to university career fairs or give talks in lectures
Jun 20 15:09:37 <ericwill>	Leo speaks in some university classes about Red Hat and open source
Jun 20 15:09:38 <akurtakov>	ericwill: forget about it
Jun 20 15:09:39 <ericwill>	something similar
Jun 20 15:09:57 <akurtakov>	we can not rely on foundation to do anything specific to one project
Jun 20 15:10:19 <akurtakov>	they to try to stay away from things that "don't benefit all projects:
Jun 20 15:10:33 <akurtakov>	which is impossible IMHO but they insist on it
Jun 20 15:10:51 <ericwill>	that's too bad, all could benefit from this
Jun 20 15:11:15 <akurtakov>	you can talk to Sopot to hear that they don't want to even bless his twitter account as foundation thing
Jun 20 15:11:34 <akurtakov>	as for them these things are beneficial only for the IDE
Jun 20 15:11:39 <ericwill>	that is quite sad
Jun 20 15:12:01 <akurtakov>	so it's about things we (+friends) can do
Jun 20 15:12:30 <akurtakov>	speaking of eclipse ide - it's our team + Vogella
Jun 20 15:12:41 <akurtakov>	^^ IMHO :)
Jun 20 15:14:16 <ericwill>	Vogella could be a help, he knows that SWT being in good shape is directly tied to the user experience of platform UI
Jun 20 15:14:30 <akurtakov>	btw, if things go according to my plan - you should become committers to whole platform :)
Jun 20 15:14:55 <akurtakov>	I hope that by end of year we will be single project
Jun 20 15:15:05 <akurtakov>	we seem to have an agreement to merge 
Jun 20 15:16:14 <ericwill>	does that mean platform UI committers become SWT committers?
Jun 20 15:16:56 <akurtakov>	it means all platform.* becomes a single committers list
Jun 20 15:17:08 <akurtakov>	and yes to swt committers
Jun 20 15:17:58 <akurtakov>	but this troubles me - in Mandriva we had a single list of committers - everything from kernel to gnome-dictionary or freemind 
Jun 20 15:18:25 <akurtakov>	if you're committer you had access to everything, and people were still acting sensibly
Jun 20 15:18:43 <akurtakov>	not a single failure in more than 2 years of someone breaking things badly
Jun 20 15:19:16 <akurtakov>	in a way it's a matter of trust more than technical expertise
Jun 20 15:19:55 <akurtakov>	but makes changes that need to apply to multiple repos way easier than current find dozen committers to drive a change
Jun 20 15:20:06 <ericwill>	hmm
Jun 20 15:20:27 <ericwill>	only concern I have is that we would get committers who fix SWT by calling redraw() or something similar -- not real fixes
Jun 20 15:21:27 <akurtakov>	yeah, I have heard these concerns 
Jun 20 15:21:47 <akurtakov>	still, have you ever touched macos code ?
Jun 20 15:22:18 <akurtakov>	you would do it only if you're fairly certain in what you do or search competent opinion on it
Jun 20 15:22:49 <akurtakov>	and empowering committers doesn't mean they will abuse it
Jun 20 15:23:11 <akurtakov>	easy things will go faster, more difficult ones will get proper reviews
Jun 20 15:23:19 <akurtakov>	that's my mandriva experience
Jun 20 15:23:25 <ericwill>	that's a good point
Jun 20 15:23:32 <ipun>	akurtakov: its an interesting idea to merge everyone together as one project
Jun 20 15:23:37 <ericwill>	it shouldn't be an issue as long as there is vigilance
Jun 20 15:23:37 <ipun>	but i could see there be faults
Jun 20 15:23:48 <akurtakov>	and I want to believe that eclipse community is at least that much responsible :)
Jun 20 15:23:49 <ipun>	im curious what the numbers of actual contributors are though
Jun 20 15:24:40 <akurtakov>	ipun: https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.platform/who
Jun 20 15:24:59 <akurtakov>	and these are people that have contributed
Jun 20 15:25:11 <akurtakov>	not all of them are committers
Jun 20 15:25:16 <akurtakov>	e.g. like you :)
Jun 20 15:25:58 <ipun>	haha yu
Jun 20 15:26:01 <ipun>	yup
Jun 20 15:26:21 <ipun>	pretty cool visual guide 
Jun 20 15:27:11 <ipun>	but in that regard, I think this community is sensitive enough to not have things breaking badly
Jun 20 15:28:02 <ipun>	i think it could also benefit later if we do merge everything together so that when we refer to "eclipse" we might be able to have more leverage to have the foundation support things like University Fairs because theres less segregation within the community 
Jun 20 15:36:04 <akurtakov>	what I have to add is that e.g. there are many p2 patches that I have to review
Jun 20 15:36:20 <akurtakov>	even though I'm not really confident there
Jun 20 15:36:44 <akurtakov>	if we have single set of committers we can split this work allowing easier/faster/better reviews
Jun 20 15:36:53 <akurtakov>	and this is my ultimate goal
Jun 20 15:38:15 <akurtakov>	if the price for that is some temp issues till we adjust the process
Jun 20 15:38:20 <akurtakov>	it's small price to pay
Jun 20 15:39:43 <ipun>	fair enough 
Jun 20 15:57:37 <ericwill>	akurtakov overall I am in favour of it
Jun 20 15:57:48 <ericwill>	if people break some stuff, just revert :)
Jun 20 16:44:55 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hmm https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/38/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/ColorDialog.java
Jun 20 16:44:57 <akurtakov>	why?
Jun 20 16:45:36 <akurtakov>	I can see later in the code there is different function called for pre 3.4
Jun 20 16:46:02 <ericwill>	akurtakov GdkRGBA support was added in 3.0, but the GtkColorChooserDialog (which uses GdkRGBA instead of GdkColor) was only added in 3.4
Jun 20 16:46:04 <ericwill>	so there is a gap
Jun 20 16:46:32 <akurtakov>	that's not fine
Jun 20 16:47:03 <akurtakov>	can't the guards be adjusted accordingly?
Jun 20 16:47:27 <akurtakov>	I mean gtk_color_chooser_dialog_new  is used only for 3.4+
Jun 20 16:47:47 <akurtakov>	for older versions gtk_color_selection_dialog_new
Jun 20 16:47:48 <akurtakov>	is used
Jun 20 16:48:14 <akurtakov>	so I don't see what the assert is giving us other than breaking 3.0-3.4 range which will use collor selection anyway
Jun 20 16:48:34 <ericwill>	akurtakov it means we will have to use GdkColor Java objects for 3.0 - 3.4, and in GdkColor.java there is a call to GdkColor_sizeof()
Jun 20 16:48:45 <ericwill>	which would crash if this isn't provided on GTK3
Jun 20 16:49:12 <akurtakov>	and why wouldn't it ?
Jun 20 16:49:27 <akurtakov>	I mean it's not fine to just say this api doesn't work for 3.0-3.4 
Jun 20 16:49:37 <akurtakov>	esp when it was owrking previous
Jun 20 16:49:51 <ericwill>	yeah this was something I meant to ask you but forgot
Jun 20 16:50:06 <ericwill>	okay I will fix it
Jun 20 16:50:33 <akurtakov>	ericwill: it's not gonna be big fix , right? 
Jun 20 16:50:41 <akurtakov>	at least I don't think so :)
Jun 20 16:51:14 <akurtakov>	btw, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/38/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Combo.java
Jun 20 16:51:26 <akurtakov>	asserts like that make me a bit nervous
Jun 20 16:51:49 <akurtakov>	will the functions not be reached by the other gtk version with your patch
Jun 20 16:52:10 <ericwill>	akurtakov for the ColorDialog thing: no shouldn't be a big fix
Jun 20 16:52:16 <akurtakov>	I assume so by reading but want to be sure
Jun 20 16:52:24 <ericwill>	for the asserts, yes that's correct
Jun 20 16:52:41 <ericwill>	no code should reach any color function that uses GdkRGBA outside of GTK3
Jun 20 16:52:52 <akurtakov>	ok
Jun 20 16:53:16 <akurtakov>	fwiw, I never used runtime asserts 
Jun 20 16:53:37 <akurtakov>	so I'm kind of unsure how they work :)
Jun 20 16:53:49 <akurtakov>	will they just print to syserr ?
Jun 20 16:55:01 <ericwill>	so with assert
Jun 20 16:55:12 <ericwill>	they only have an effect when you run the JVM with assertions enabled
Jun 20 16:55:30 <ericwill>	and then they print a warning in syserr
Jun 20 16:55:42 <ericwill>	by default Eclipse doesn't run with assertions enabled
Jun 20 16:55:50 <ericwill>	but if you run a JUnit test they are
Jun 20 16:56:42 <akurtakov>	ericwill: have you tested it with gtk older than 3.16? so we are sure that we don't end up in this assertion called on older gtk version 
Jun 20 16:58:37 <ericwill>	yes
Jun 20 16:58:43 <ericwill>	I went back as far as 3.10
Jun 20 16:58:53 <akurtakov>	care to explain https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/38/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/DateTime.java to me
Jun 20 16:59:11 <akurtakov>	the Version >= 3.16 becomes  GTK3
Jun 20 16:59:35 <akurtakov>	this is because we now use RGBA everywhere ?
Jun 20 17:00:04 <akurtakov>	I like it just again confirming my reading :)
Jun 20 17:00:14 <ericwill>	yes, with the patch everything on GTK3 uses GdkRGBA
Jun 20 17:00:22 <ericwill>	everything GTK2 runs GdkColor
Jun 20 17:00:44 <ericwill>	also if you want to run anything with assertions enabled, in the launch config under VM arguments, add "-ea"
Jun 20 17:02:32 <akurtakov>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/38/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/IME.java
Jun 20 17:02:40 <akurtakov>	there are few todos you added :)
Jun 20 17:03:17 <akurtakov>	I guess either leftovers or guards are really due
Jun 20 17:03:37 <ericwill>	ah, looks like I did
Jun 20 17:03:39 <ericwill>	an easy fix
Jun 20 17:03:54 <ericwill>	just move the new GdkColor() bits into the GTK2 guard
Jun 20 17:04:19 *	akurtakov is code reading only now
Jun 20 17:04:32 <akurtakov>	will try it tomorrow, hopefully with your adjustments :)
Jun 20 17:04:44 <akurtakov>	fwiw, proper commit message is due to
Jun 20 17:05:10 <ericwill>	sounds good
Jun 20 17:05:17 <ericwill>	a second set of eyes is very helpful
Jun 20 17:05:23 <ericwill>	especially when having worked on this for so long
Jun 20 17:06:16 <akurtakov>	fwiw, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=518532
Jun 20 17:06:28 <akurtakov>	I'm pushing hard for modernization 
Jun 20 17:06:46 <ericwill>	I saw that, removing GDK drawing will make the code a lot simpler
Jun 20 17:06:51 <ericwill>	especially for things like GC
Jun 20 17:06:52 <akurtakov>	it's a step towards gtk2 removal
Jun 20 17:07:07 <akurtakov>	as gtk2 is used by rhel6 only 
Jun 20 17:07:19 <akurtakov>	and others that opt in but I don't really care about them that much :)
Jun 20 17:07:34 <ericwill>	I will be so happy when we remove GTK2 :)
Jun 20 17:11:09 <akurtakov>	I'm pushing as much as I can
Jun 20 17:11:28 <akurtakov>	while trying to not cross the line where people stop listening and just say no :)
Jun 20 17:11:41 *	akurtakov feels like a politician lately
Jun 20 17:12:20 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/38/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Widget.java this looks suspicious
Jun 20 17:13:36 <ericwill>	akurtakov I moved it into Control
Jun 20 17:13:41 <ericwill>	line 5020
Jun 20 17:13:44 <akurtakov>	ok
Jun 20 17:14:03 <ericwill>	the foreground machinery is a bit gimped, half of it was implemented in widget, half in Control
Jun 20 17:14:58 <akurtakov>	ericwill: please nuke the sysout https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/38/tests/org.eclipse.swt.tests/JUnit+Tests/org/eclipse/swt/tests/junit/Test_org_eclipse_swt_widgets_Control.java

Jun 20 17:15:46 <ericwill>	oops
Jun 20 17:15:47 <ericwill>	will do
Jun 20 17:19:41 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, there is issue with http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/diff/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse%20SWT%20PI/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/internal/gtk/OS.java?id=56755d505b2f2ece25e1a012100d096898dafaf7
Jun 20 17:20:06 <akurtakov>	long[] value should be long /*int*/
Jun 20 17:20:25 <akurtakov>	swt tools put errors in my workspace for that
Jun 20 17:20:37 <ericwill>	doh
Jun 20 17:20:43 <ericwill>	sorry about that, forgot to enable that setting
Jun 20 17:20:45 <ericwill>	will fix it now
Jun 20 17:20:51 <akurtakov>	I can do it if you want
Jun 20 17:21:00 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay please do
Jun 20 17:26:25 <akurtakov>	ericwill: done
Jun 20 17:26:33 <akurtakov>	with that I wish you good night :)
Jun 20 17:26:46 <ericwill>	akurtakov thanks, I turned my warnings on. good night :)
Jun 21 12:24:39 <akurtakov>	ericwill: lufimtse: please feel free to throw bugs at ipun :)
Jun 21 12:24:58 <akurtakov>	overall, he is tasked with finishing his bugs and helping with the triaging
Jun 21 12:25:09 <lufimtse>	ok
Jun 21 12:25:18 <lufimtse>	:-D
Jun 21 12:25:20 <lufimtse>	ak
Jun 21 12:25:21 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Jun 21 12:25:31 *	ericwill loads a bunch of bugs into his hands and throws them at ipun
Jun 21 12:25:52 <akurtakov>	ericwill: few loads please :)
Jun 21 12:27:00 <akurtakov>	btw, who wants GLCanvas ? it is smth I hope one of you will be able to pick up after new year :)
Jun 21 12:27:12 <akurtakov>	the other one get a11y :)
Jun 21 12:27:19 <akurtakov>	but it's ASAP :)
Jun 21 12:39:10 <ericwill>	I don't think anyone wants a11y :P
Jun 21 12:40:04 <akurtakov>	that could only mean - you both get it :)
Jun 21 12:40:16 <ericwill>	haha, I don't mind working on it once the color port is done
Jun 21 12:40:24 <ericwill>	lufimtse can have GLCanvas
Jun 21 12:40:51 <akurtakov>	yeah, after being done with webkit2 :)
Jun 21 12:44:18 <akurtakov>	btw, how is the color port going ?
Jun 21 12:44:30 <akurtakov>	have you adjusted Leo's comments ?
Jun 21 12:44:36 <ericwill>	akurtakov good, yes I made them
Jun 21 12:44:45 <ericwill>	was just about to say you can try it out again if you like
Jun 21 12:44:59 <akurtakov>	I tried it today and there was nothing broken I spotted
Jun 21 12:45:07 <akurtakov>	will do thorough test later
Jun 21 12:45:18 <ericwill>	okay
Jun 21 12:45:20 <ericwill>	btw
Jun 21 12:45:31 <ericwill>	on GTK2 Table and Tree bg colors do not work
Jun 21 12:45:33 <ericwill>	on master
Jun 21 12:45:38 <ericwill>	(unrelated to color port)
Jun 21 12:45:52 <ericwill>	maybe something ipun can investigate?
Jun 21 12:45:57 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I'm working ont this guy atm btw: Bug 465280 – [GTK3] OS.gtk_widget_get_allocation returns (0,0) for invisible controls
Jun 21 12:45:59 <akurtakov>	meh 
Jun 21 12:46:08 <akurtakov>	I don't care about GTK2 :)
Jun 21 12:46:16 <akurtakov>	tbh, I want to remove it
Jun 21 12:46:29 <akurtakov>	don't bother with gtk2 guys
Jun 21 12:46:39 <akurtakov>	unless someone finds it's your patch that broke it :)
Jun 21 12:47:09 <ericwill>	works for me :)
Jun 21 12:47:44 <akurtakov>	now that we don't have to support RHEL 6 it's of no use for us
Jun 21 12:47:59 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: btw, good new for you - RHEL 7.4 will have webkit2 :)
Jun 21 12:48:23 <akurtakov>	just in time isn't it :)
Jun 21 12:48:29 <akurtakov>	release is in september :)
Jun 21 12:49:05 <lufimtse>	nice
Jun 21 12:49:43 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: are there other things but return js left there ?
Jun 21 12:50:19 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so far no. But it wouldn't hurt for me to go through the whole browser api to make sure it all works.
Jun 21 12:50:31 <akurtakov>	ok
Jun 21 16:22:32 <ericwill>	akurtakov is 4.7 backport branch open for merging yet?
Jun 21 16:22:39 <akurtakov>	ericwill: not yet
Jun 21 16:24:11 <akurtakov>	this is postponed until 4.7 is out officialy so we can handle the extrme case of rebuild on 4.7 for Oxygen.0 if smth really severe hapens
Jun 21 16:25:58 <ericwill>	okay, np :)
Jun 22 10:52:41 <ericwill>	akurtakov: hey, Leo and I were wondering if this can be merged: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/99534/
Jun 22 10:55:31 <akurtakov>	if you're confident in it
Jun 22 10:56:10 <akurtakov>	I have my principal concerns over such tests 
Jun 22 10:56:37 <akurtakov>	aka how well it will work on different versions systems etc.
Jun 22 10:56:48 <akurtakov>	but if you find it valuable - go oon
Jun 22 10:57:00 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what you mean over different version sysetms?
Jun 22 10:57:22 <akurtakov>	well, if the test is specific to gtk
Jun 22 10:57:39 <akurtakov>	what hapens if one runs them on e.g. ubuntu/rhel7/mageial...
Jun 22 10:59:00 <akurtakov>	from releng pov they look stable
Jun 22 10:59:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmm. But in what way would all test be different to gtk specific tests in such context?
Jun 22 10:59:41 <lufimtse>	both would run into the same problem?
Jun 22 11:00:24 <akurtakov>	yeah, I mean if we have tests that are same for all WS we claim this is the right way and the system is offending
Jun 22 11:00:56 <akurtakov>	if we have ws specific tests - it becomes gray area as it obviously it's not specified behavior of swt
Jun 22 11:01:11 <akurtakov>	anyway, this is just thoughts and you're working more on this so it's your call
Jun 22 11:01:35 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I see. I think in such a case, a jUnit test can be made more generic to see the common behaviour.
Jun 22 11:09:52 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: if we can get your +1 for https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/45
Jun 22 11:10:02 <akurtakov>	and Eric can push it
Jun 22 11:10:35 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Ok. I'll review.
Jun 22 11:25:34 <akurtakov>	ericwill: getting rgba will not magically enable transparent tooltips, will it ?
Jun 22 11:26:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov not the javadoc ones, since they are not really tooltips :)
Jun 22 11:27:50 <ericwill>	the native tooltips (like when you hover over a button on the eclipse workbench toolbar) are already transparent
Jun 22 12:23:42 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: are launch groups storable in launch file ?
Jun 22 12:24:05 <akurtakov>	that would be nice
Jun 22 12:25:02 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what do you mean?
Jun 22 12:25:14 <lufimtse>	whats a launch file?
Jun 22 12:25:20 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: you know that you can store launch configuration in a file and store it in git
Jun 22 12:26:32 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: like http://git.eclipse.org/c/equinox/rt.equinox.p2.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.equinox.frameworkadmin.test/Framework%20Admin%20Test.launch
Jun 22 12:27:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, that's new info to me.
Jun 22 12:27:19 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, how do you run such a .launch?
Jun 22 12:27:35 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: if you open a project that has such launch file
Jun 22 12:27:48 <akurtakov>	it will be auto added in the launch configurations :)
Jun 22 12:27:54 <akurtakov>	magic is magic :)
Jun 22 12:28:06 <lufimtse>	oh.
Jun 22 12:28:16 <lufimtse>	Interesting. I need to investigate.
Jun 22 12:28:24 <lufimtse>	This could make life a lot easier.
Jun 22 12:29:07 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: there is export wizard 
Jun 22 12:29:22 <akurtakov>	so you can get launch file generated from your existing launch
Jun 22 12:30:18 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah, that's how to get it. Yea, it seems Launch Group is in there.
Jun 22 12:30:34 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, could potentially be used for ALLTests + platformTest.
Jun 22 12:30:42 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: exactly my idea :)
Jun 22 12:30:48 <lufimtse>	with Gtk2/Gtk3 versions.
Jun 22 12:31:06 <akurtakov>	and if hte launch is stored in the platform test bundles voila :)
Jun 22 12:31:24 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, btw, is it possible to have a hudson that also does cocoa/Win32
Jun 22 12:31:28 <lufimtse>	for patch submissions?
Jun 22 12:31:35 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: short: no
Jun 22 12:31:41 <lufimtse>	derp.
Jun 22 12:32:22 <akurtakov>	long: technically there are such machines but they are limited as foundation can not expose windows/mac to the general public like that for licencing issues
Jun 22 12:33:14 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: btw, it would be nice if export was available from the launch dialog
Jun 22 12:33:29 <akurtakov>	as the export wizard is kind of hidden
Jun 22 12:38:41 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I agree. Had a simmilar thought.
Jun 22 12:38:57 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: feel free to open a bug :)
Jun 22 12:39:01 <lufimtse>	X-D
Jun 22 12:39:34 <akurtakov>	Eclipe is full of these nice things but UX is not the best :)
Jun 22 12:39:54 <akurtakov>	and add me on cc to that bug I'll try to get someone on it :)
Jun 22 12:40:06 <akurtakov>	although it should be fairly trivial 
Jun 22 12:41:45 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I'm getting a lot of errors from bugzilla: There was an error sending mail from 'bugzilla-daemon@eclipse.org' to 'dirk.fauth@googlemail.com': Can't send data 
Jun 22 12:41:53 <lufimtse>	?
Jun 22 12:42:04 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: network issue https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.swt-Gerrit/4728/console
Jun 22 12:42:31 <lufimtse>	derp.
Jun 22 12:43:29 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=518652
Jun 22 12:46:20 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I'm getting bugzilla error after every single bugzilla opertion. 
Jun 22 12:46:26 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, do you get that also?
Jun 22 12:46:28 <akurtakov>	yes
Jun 22 12:46:31 <lufimtse>	der.p
Jun 22 12:46:45 <akurtakov>	infra is broken
Jun 22 13:00:01 <akurtakov>	done for today, can't wait to remove gdk draw once rgba work is in :)
Jun 22 13:00:04 <akurtakov>	g'night
Jun 22 14:34:52 <ericwill>	ipun if you are looking for a bug to work on, you can take this one from me: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=494771
Jun 22 14:35:34 <ipun>	ericwill: sure i can take a look. You want to triage for a bit then?
Jun 22 14:35:50 <ericwill>	ipun I might do triage tomorrow, we'll see
Jun 23 11:26:06 <ipun>	ericwill|afk: man this spinner bug guy is...thurough
Jun 23 11:45:27 <ericwill>	ipun haha I saw
Jun 23 11:45:32 <ericwill>	just one of those types of bugs
Jun 23 11:53:38 <ericwill>	lufimtse can we just merge that bug snippet thing and the readme? I want to add some other snippets today
Jun 23 12:25:54 <akurtakov>	ericwill: wow, you spamed swt inbox :)
Jun 23 12:26:11 <akurtakov>	that's so we don't think we are close to being decent :)
Jun 23 12:27:32 <ericwill>	akurtakov haha, I noticed yesterday running the build script that a lot of stuff is deprecated that we don't have bugs for
Jun 23 12:28:54 <ericwill>	a brief glance says most of them are easy fixes
Jun 23 12:50:52 <lufimtse>	hello
Jun 23 12:51:50 <lufimtse>	ericwill, +1 to submitting bug reports. We need to weed out these deprecated functions for gtk4.
Jun 23 12:52:11 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I was having the same thought about the snippet business.
Jun 23 12:52:30 <ericwill>	lufimtse okay, I will merge it
Jun 23 12:52:51 <ericwill>	also just uploaded some revised color port stuff, when you have a chance
Jun 23 12:52:57 <lufimtse>	ok,

Jun 26 10:35:05 <ipun>	akurtakov: what do you think of this guys reasoning for using async in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=517633 ?
Jun 26 10:38:43 <akurtakov>	what is the async? java one?
Jun 26 10:40:35 <ipun>	akurtakov: he wanted to call OS.gtk_spin_button_update() on async instead
Jun 26 10:40:44 <lufimtse>	ipun, I think he mentioned async is one possible solution, not the only one.
Jun 26 10:40:53 <lufimtse>	ipun, afaik, we spoke about using a different signal, no?
Jun 26 10:41:05 <ipun>	lufimtse: tried it already
Jun 26 10:41:11 <lufimtse>	result?
Jun 26 10:41:24 <ipun>	the other signals are only sent on the widget being actually changed after called by gkt_spin_button_update()
Jun 26 10:41:26 <ipun>	so no, it doesnt work
Jun 26 10:42:22 <ipun>	lufimtse: also where did you hear he had mulitple solutions?
Jun 26 10:43:50 <lufimtse>	ipun, let's chat.
Jun 26 10:45:45 <akurtakov>	replied
Jun 26 10:46:46 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: the async is a total no -go 
Jun 26 10:47:01 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: see my reasoning in the bug

Jun 26 12:19:52 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, btw, is backport branch open for backports?
Jun 26 12:20:21 <akurtakov>	no, it will happen after Oxygen is officially released
Jun 26 12:20:32 <akurtakov>	there is still the risk of last minute rebuild
Jun 26 12:20:38 <akurtakov>	so backports can not be allowed
Jun 26 12:27:31 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah. Ok.
Jun 26 13:40:05 <ipun>	ericwill lufimtse anyone that is free, could someone run snippet141 and see if it runs with current gtk and swt versions
Jun 26 13:40:06 <ipun>	?
Jun 26 13:40:32 <ericwill>	ipun sure give me a sec
Jun 26 13:41:23 <ipun>	thanks!
Jun 26 13:41:32 <ericwill>	I get an error
Jun 26 13:41:38 <ericwill>	"There was an error loading the GIF"
Jun 26 13:41:52 <ipun>	hmm okay mine says it cant load the class
Jun 26 13:42:03 <ipun>	im wondering what i should do with this https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=287477
Jun 26 14:21:07 <akurtakov>	fwiw, swt has it's own gif/jpeg implementations
Jun 26 14:31:42 <ericwill>	akurtakov do you know what is going on here? http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/diff/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse%20SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Display.java?h=silenio/Bug389910&id=cd78cc4a8b2e806160de2908244830099a48d3b9
Jun 26 14:31:51 <ericwill>	in the "toGdkColor" method
Jun 26 14:33:47 <ericwill>	seems like some math to convert from HSV to HSL...then back to RGB
Jun 26 14:43:32 <akurtakov>	ericwill: no idea :)
Jun 26 14:43:36 <akurtakov>	was I involved ?
Jun 26 14:45:13 <ericwill>	nope
Jun 26 14:45:20 <ericwill>	akurtakov seems to be conversion with this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV
Jun 26 14:50:53 <akurtakov>	ericwill: so do you think it's no longer needed or smth in it troubles you ?
Jun 26 14:51:14 <ericwill>	akurtakov we still need it, I can't find a suitable replacement
Jun 26 14:51:24 <ericwill>	and Leo pointed out in a patch review that the method makes no sense
Jun 26 14:51:28 <ericwill>	so I am documenting it
Jun 26 14:53:20 <akurtakov>	always good :)
Jun 26 15:05:51 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: there were talks about having image decoders based on gdk-pixbuf
Jun 26 15:06:23 <akurtakov>	as this would give support for latest specs and it would give also way more details properly implemented
Jun 26 15:06:34 <akurtakov>	and quite probably speed up too 
Jun 26 15:06:56 <akurtakov>	but this has always been very low in prio list
Jun 26 15:34:55 <ericwill>	akurtakov do you know what IME is and how I can test it
Jun 26 15:35:04 <ericwill>	I don't see any snippets for it
Jun 26 15:38:53 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmm
Jun 27 09:30:31 <ericwill>	lufimtse good morning, thank you for the patch review
Jun 27 09:37:14 <ericwill>	akurtakov: http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/commit/?id=8f5c12dbbf0d52d77529e8b468c625831e5f4dd0
Jun 27 09:37:15 <ericwill>	:)
Jun 27 09:38:18 <akurtakov>	yay :)
Jun 27 09:38:33 <akurtakov>	one of the most eventfull swt months lately
Jun 27 09:39:01 <akurtakov>	https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.platform.swt/who
Jun 27 09:39:06 <akurtakov>	pretty good for June 
Jun 27 09:40:01 <ericwill>	absolutely
Jun 27 09:41:49 <ipun>	cool i see my name!
Jun 27 09:42:52 <ericwill>	akurtakov you can go ahead and remove GDK drawing now :)
Jun 27 09:43:13 <akurtakov>	ericwill: will do it tomorrow
Jun 27 09:43:36 <akurtakov>	still discussing with Lakshmi how to handle xulrunner removal :)
Jun 27 09:43:41 <akurtakov>	and doing it around the world
Jun 27 09:43:47 <akurtakov>	e.g. launcher was today :)
Jun 27 09:43:59 <ericwill>	perfect
Jun 27 10:10:34 <ipun>	akurtakov: is there any historical reasons why some SWT events are sent as post vs send when retreiving from GTK?
Jun 27 10:10:52 <akurtakov>	ipun: no idea :)
Jun 27 10:11:02 <akurtakov>	I gave up on remembering
Jun 27 10:11:13 <akurtakov>	gut feelings + reading for me :)
Jun 27 10:37:52 <lufimtse>	ipun, send is often used if gtkEvents need a return value. post is usually used if they don't.
Jun 27 10:38:23 <lufimtse>	ipun, but if you change post to send now and vice versa, it can break order of events. So it has to be well justified and tested.
Jun 27 10:51:20 <lufimtse>	ipun, Bug 515396 – [Wayland] dragDetect should block till DnD state is known 
Jun 27 10:51:20 <lufimtse>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=515396
Jun 27 14:00:03 <ericwill>	lufimtse hello
Jun 27 14:00:06 <ericwill>	do you have a minute?
Jun 27 14:36:56 <lufimtse>	hey
Jun 27 14:36:57 <lufimtse>	ericwill, 
Jun 27 14:37:00 <lufimtse>	sap
Jun 27 14:37:35 <ericwill>	lufimtse hey, for the GTK specific JUnits
Jun 27 14:37:43 <ericwill>	I wanted to know if you had naming scheme in mind
Jun 27 14:37:49 <ericwill>	I came up with this so far: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/98569/
Jun 27 14:40:01 <lufimtse>	ericwill, maybe just call it Test_color.java ?
Jun 27 14:40:05 <lufimtse>	or something like that.
Jun 27 14:40:32 <ericwill>	lufimtse I thought maybe something in the name of the class would distinguish it from the cross-platform tests
Jun 27 14:40:34 <ericwill>	idk
Jun 27 14:42:02 <lufimtse>	maybe put the color tests into cross-platform test, but tell it not skip on gtk2.
Jun 27 14:42:12 <lufimtse>	but tell it *to* skip on gtk2
Jun 27 14:42:31 <ericwill>	lufimtse can we do that?
Jun 27 14:42:41 <ericwill>	I thought the gtk guards are in OS.java only
Jun 27 14:42:58 <lufimtse>	I did something similar for webkit2
Jun 27 14:43:06 <lufimtse>	you don't call os.java
Jun 27 14:43:09 <lufimtse>	instead ...
Jun 27 14:43:22 <lufimtse>	use get system property
Jun 27 14:43:33 <lufimtse>	like: String webkitGtkVersionStr = System.getProperty("org.eclipse.swt.internal.webkitgtk.version")
Jun 27 14:43:36 <lufimtse>	but for gtk
Jun 27 14:43:39 <lufimtse>	lemmeeee see
Jun 27 14:43:46 <ericwill>	lufimtse ah yeah
Jun 27 14:43:51 <ericwill>	I know what you are talking about
Jun 27 14:44:06 <lufimtse>	String gtkVersion = System.getProperty("org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.version");
Jun 27 14:44:32 <lufimtse>	see Test_*Browser
Jun 27 14:44:41 <lufimtse>	setUp()
Jun 27 14:44:44 <ericwill>	lufimtse danke
Jun 27 14:44:54 <lufimtse>	I'm setting up cross platform tests atm
Jun 27 14:45:15 <lufimtse>	one thing I didn't quite anticipate is that running jUnits over ssh is not straight forward.
Jun 27 14:45:27 <lufimtse>	it tries to tunnel them etc...
Jun 27 14:45:33 <lufimtse>	gotta find a more creative approach.
Jun 27 14:46:11 <ericwill>	ah yeah that could be tricky
Jun 27 14:46:24 <ericwill>	maybe do it headless?
Jun 27 15:36:16 <ericwill>	akurtakov how often do the hudson test machines on gerrit get updated?
Jun 27 15:36:19 <ericwill>	every night?
Jun 27 15:36:39 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yes
Jun 27 15:37:49 <ericwill>	okay, cool
Jun 27 15:39:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill: unless there is broken build :)
Jun 27 15:39:16 <akurtakov>	in which case I-build repo will not be updated
Jun 27 15:40:14 <ericwill>	akurtakov I was just wondering when I push the JUnit tests with alpha
Jun 27 15:40:20 <ericwill>	it can wait
Jun 27 15:40:28 <akurtakov>	once you see good build
Jun 27 15:44:00 <ericwill>	akurtakov after removal of GDK drawing, what stands in the way of GTK2 removal?
Jun 27 15:44:23 <akurtakov>	people will :)
Jun 27 15:45:05 <ericwill>	ah yes, the political discussions
Jun 27 15:45:36 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I'm looking to remove rhel6 out of the equation by dropping cairo pre 1.10
Jun 27 15:46:07 <akurtakov>	that would silence many people :)
Jun 27 15:50:51 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I'm not pushing too much now 
Jun 27 15:51:06 <akurtakov>	as there are other changes which require pushing 
Jun 27 15:51:16 <akurtakov>	but gtk2 removal is about time
Jun 27 15:51:32 <akurtakov>	and once we have gtk4 betas we will claim it inevitable
Jun 27 15:52:11 <ericwill>	right, makes sense
Jun 28 09:59:58 <lufimtse>	https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/platform-releng-dev/
Jun 28 10:00:19 <lufimtse>	http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/
Jun 28 10:00:25 <lufimtse>	ericwill, builds produced, but not yet linked.
Jun 28 10:00:49 <akurtakov>	I'm working on starting doing 4.7.1 maintenance builds as we speak
Jun 28 10:01:08 <akurtakov>	aiming that all this is fixed by eow
Jun 28 10:02:04 <akurtakov>	after all we have the release today
Jun 28 10:02:08 <akurtakov>	PARTYYY :)
Jun 28 10:03:11 <ericwill>	akurtakov :D
Jun 28 10:03:19 <ericwill>	a good reason to have some beers
Jun 28 10:06:24 <ipun>	oh yeah
Jun 28 10:06:27 <ipun>	todays the day :D
Jun 28 10:06:37 <ipun>	release party on blujeans it is
Jun 29 09:53:05 <akurtakov>	ipun: here ?
Jun 29 09:53:15 <ipun>	akurtakov: hey
Jun 29 09:53:29 <akurtakov>	what are you working on ?
Jun 29 09:54:36 <ipun>	i've been bug triaging this whole week but ive picked up https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=4745
Jun 29 09:54:52 <ipun>	this one is pretty much done im just trying to see if i can set up a windows VM to test how it looks
Jun 29 09:55:08 <ipun>	im waiting for Leo to test it on OSX but hes not in yet
Jun 29 10:02:06 <akurtakov>	please look at TableDragSourceEffect 
Jun 29 10:02:17 <akurtakov>	or TreeDragSourceEffect
Jun 29 10:02:28 <akurtakov>	drawing is in if GTK3 block
Jun 29 10:02:36 <ipun>	there a bug id for that?
Jun 29 10:02:40 <akurtakov>	but doing cairo drawing should be suitable for all
Jun 29 10:02:43 <akurtakov>	no
Jun 29 10:02:48 <akurtakov>	just saw it
Jun 29 10:02:54 <akurtakov>	while looking at other things
Jun 29 10:03:17 <akurtakov>	I don't know how much porting would be needed
Jun 29 10:03:25 <akurtakov>	probably none for the actual drawing
Jun 29 10:03:35 <akurtakov>	but I would expect some "hooking" fun
Jun 29 10:03:43 <akurtakov>	as it doesn't work out of the box :)
Jun 29 10:07:50 <ipun>	okay i will take a look
Jun 29 10:10:59 <akurtakov>	feel free to open a bug
Jun 29 10:11:15 <akurtakov>	it's just smth I found while looking to remove gdkdraw
Jun 29 10:17:19 <ipun>	akurtakov: so did you want to remove cairo or remove the guard?
Jun 29 10:17:22 *	ipun is slightly confused
Jun 29 10:17:34 <akurtakov>	remove the else clause
Jun 29 10:17:39 <akurtakov>	aka not cairo drawing
Jun 29 10:27:30 <ipun>	akurtakov: okay. But still have a solution for GTK2 i assume?
Jun 29 11:03:41 <ericwill>	lufimtse color port tests ready to be reviewed once more
Jun 29 14:19:06 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/
Jun 29 14:19:16 <akurtakov>	4.8 I builds are shown now 
Jun 29 15:14:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ooeee
Jun 29 15:14:40 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: 4.7.1 builds should be up by Tue
Jun 29 15:15:05 <akurtakov>	it involved me requesting resources and pde commit rights so I can speed it up in the future
Jun 30 09:30:30 <akurtakov>	ipun: how is the dnd effect stuff going ?
Jun 30 09:38:54 <ipun>	akurtakov: good, i was just about to msg you
Jun 30 09:39:14 <ipun>	i spent a while on #cairo and #gtk to figure this out
Jun 30 09:39:21 <akurtakov>	so sounds doable?
Jun 30 09:39:50 <ipun>	theres a small problem. The way that GTK gives us the drag icon differs in GTK2 vs GTK3
Jun 30 09:40:13 <ipun>	gtk_tree_view_create_row_drag_icon() is not deprecated and is in both versions, but they return different values
Jun 30 09:40:29 <ipun>	in GTK2 a GDKpixmap is returned, while GTK3 returns a cairo surface
Jun 30 09:41:09 <ipun>	they've dropped support for GdkPixmap for Cairo as of GTK3, which makes it difficult as there is no methods in GTK2 that will give us a cairo surface image instead
Jun 30 09:41:22 <ipun>	their fix was basically for GTK3, which kind of screws things up for us 
Jun 30 09:45:22 <ipun>	what do you think?
Jun 30 09:46:39 <akurtakov>	not sure I follow
Jun 30 09:46:48 <akurtakov>	we work dynamically
Jun 30 09:47:03 <akurtakov>	and GdkPixmap is smth we can use with cairo
Jun 30 09:47:10 <akurtakov>	on gtk2 
Jun 30 09:47:13 <akurtakov>	or not?
Jun 30 09:48:07 <ipun>	so basically in Gtk2 a GdkPixmap is returned, which is deprecated
Jun 30 09:48:13 <ipun>	but, we can convert the pixmap to cairo using gdk_cairo_set_source_pixmap
Jun 30 09:48:19 <ipun>	however, that method is removed in GTK3
Jun 30 09:48:38 <akurtakov>	which is fine
Jun 30 09:48:41 <ipun>	so we will still need a (OS.GTK3) conditional
Jun 30 09:48:45 <akurtakov>	ok
Jun 30 09:48:54 <ipun>	are you okay with that?
Jun 30 09:48:57 <akurtakov>	yes
Jun 30 09:49:03 <ipun>	kk
Jun 30 09:49:10 <ipun>	ill come up with something asap
Jun 30 09:49:13 <akurtakov>	having a cairo drawing (even if pixmap based) on gtk2
Jun 30 09:49:20 <akurtakov>	is better than gdkdrawable
Jun 30 09:49:30 <akurtakov>	which was deprecated even before that :)
Jun 30 09:49:43 <akurtakov>	and it allow me nuke all gdkdrawable stuff :)
Jun 30 09:50:14 <ipun>	sounds good, i think this is very possible then :)
Jun 30 10:06:47 <akurtakov>	one hell of a commit coming guys :)
Jun 30 10:12:45 <akurtakov>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/100472/ 
Jun 30 10:12:55 <akurtakov>	I would appreciate a quick glance
Jun 30 10:16:43 <ipun>	akurtakov: oh my...
Jun 30 10:16:52 <ericwill>	lufimtse ^^
Jun 30 10:20:01 <ipun>	i dont think lufimtse is here
Jun 30 10:20:05 <ipun>	hes not in the office
Jun 30 10:20:20 <ipun>	he'll show up though I talked to him last night
Jun 30 10:20:43 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, mylyn notification background is broken with the latest build
Jun 30 10:22:00 <akurtakov>	ericwill: anyway, I'll push it unless you find issue while I do same surgery to TextLayout :)
Jun 30 10:22:50 <ericwill>	akurtakov screenshot of breakage?
Jun 30 10:23:02 <akurtakov>	ericwill: for mylyn ?
Jun 30 10:23:05 <ericwill>	akurtakov yeah
Jun 30 10:25:42 <akurtakov>	meh, it worked now
Jun 30 10:25:52 <akurtakov>	worst case , doesn't happen everytime
Jun 30 10:26:07 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, open preferences
Jun 30 10:26:38 <akurtakov>	do you see the right column being all white background ?
Jun 30 10:27:11 <ericwill>	window -> preferences?
Jun 30 10:27:15 <akurtakov>	I think it's same thing there 
Jun 30 10:27:17 <akurtakov>	yes
Jun 30 10:28:20 <ericwill>	preferences window looks fine to me
Jun 30 10:28:40 <ericwill>	or is this under some specific preference?
Jun 30 10:29:27 <akurtakov>	ericwill: are you unde rwayland ?
Jun 30 10:30:06 <ericwill>	akurtakov no
Jun 30 10:30:10 <ericwill>	are you?
Jun 30 10:32:38 <akurtakov>	yes
Jun 30 10:33:15 <ericwill>	let me try it, brb
Jun 30 10:35:09 <ericwill>	akurtakov still looks fine to me
Jun 30 10:35:30 <akurtakov>	hmm ok
Jun 30 10:35:35 <akurtakov>	please stay on wayland
Jun 30 10:35:41 <akurtakov>	it might come later :)
Jun 30 10:35:52 <ericwill>	will do
Jun 30 10:35:57 <akurtakov>	good idea in general :)
Jun 30 10:36:31 <ericwill>	a wayland only color bug would be weird
Jun 30 10:36:43 <akurtakov>	it is so awkward
Jun 30 10:37:02 <akurtakov>	my swt involvement started with adding all these ifs for gtk3
Jun 30 10:37:18 <akurtakov>	actually with cairo in gtk 2.18 :)
Jun 30 10:37:31 <akurtakov>	feels like closing the loop now by removing the old stuff
Jun 30 10:38:10 <ericwill>	it's come full circle!
Jun 30 10:43:33 <akurtakov>	yeah
Jun 30 10:43:48 <akurtakov>	so fine to push GC stuff ?
Jun 30 10:44:44 <ericwill>	akurtakov I don't see anything bad looking, you know more about it than me :)
Jun 30 10:44:55 <akurtakov>	:)
Jun 30 10:45:12 <akurtakov>	worst part is probably I'm the only one in the project remembering this shit :)
Jun 30 10:59:27 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I had to restart my ide
Jun 30 10:59:32 <akurtakov>	preferences are now fine
Jun 30 10:59:44 <akurtakov>	so there is smth somewhere causing the issues later
Jun 30 11:00:12 <ericwill>	strange
Jun 30 11:00:28 <ericwill>	not re-drawing properly maybe?
Jun 30 11:02:10 <lufimtse>	ericwill, hello'
Jun 30 11:04:26 <ericwill>	lufimtse hi, it's okay
Jun 30 11:04:32 <ericwill>	Alex already went ahead and merged
Jun 30 11:20:09 <akurtakov>	if you guys don't notice any change I did good job :)
Jun 30 11:24:32 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, so I got the preferences dialog background white again
Jun 30 11:25:04 <ericwill>	akurtakov anything specific to reproduce the issue?
Jun 30 11:25:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: no, regular coding stuff
Jun 30 11:25:25 <akurtakov>	jump to navigation search for references and etc.
Jun 30 11:25:35 <akurtakov>	after an hour doing so I get it repro
Jun 30 11:26:03 <ericwill>	very weird
Jun 30 11:26:13 <ericwill>	if it happens only on Wayland -- even weirder
Jun 30 11:27:43 <ipun>	akurtakov: so its looking more doable to get this done but i might have to rewrite getSourceImage quite a bit, might take a bit longer than a few lines changed
Jun 30 11:28:01 <akurtakov>	hmm
Jun 30 11:28:16 <akurtakov>	that's unexpected :)
Jun 30 11:29:20 <ipun>	yeah basically i have to do some conversion so that might change the actual logic to it
Jun 30 11:29:28 <ipun>	but it shouldnt be a problem, it just might look different
Jun 30 11:30:14 <akurtakov>	you're off on monday, right?
Jun 30 11:30:38 <ipun>	no im gonna be working on monday
Jun 30 11:30:54 <akurtakov>	ok, I'll look into it on monday and we can talk once you appear
Jun 30 11:30:58 <ipun>	sure
Jun 30 12:03:08 <lufimtse>	facebook launched a "workplace" version. Interesting..

Jul 03 09:49:14 *	Now talking on #SWT
Jul 04 10:10:08 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hey Eric
Jul 04 10:10:19 <akurtakov>	would you please install ubuntu in a vm and try 
Jul 04 10:10:32 <akurtakov>	my gut feeling is some weird ubuntu theme issue
Jul 04 10:10:40 <ericwill>	akurtakov already in the process of doing so :)
Jul 04 10:10:47 <akurtakov>	cool
Jul 04 10:10:48 <ericwill>	that is what I think as well
Jul 04 10:11:11 <akurtakov>	ericwill: could it be even transparency
Jul 04 10:11:37 <akurtakov>	now that the colors have transparency and adwaita doesn't define it for anything but tooltip
Jul 04 10:11:59 <akurtakov>	if ambience uses heavy transparency I can envision such problems
Jul 04 10:12:26 <ericwill>	akurtakov I will look into it. all his breakages were custom widgets/SwtFixed only widgets
Jul 04 10:12:35 <ericwill>	so transparency could be it
Jul 04 10:17:26 <ericwill>	akurtakov the issue reproduces on Ubuntu unity
Jul 04 10:17:28 <ericwill>	will try with GNOME
Jul 04 10:18:12 <akurtakov>	I don't expect change if gnome uses ambience and not adwaita :)
Jul 04 10:19:06 <ericwill>	akurtakov GNOME with ambiance broken, adwaita works
Jul 04 10:19:11 *	ericwill sighs
Jul 04 10:19:28 <akurtakov>	as expected :)
Jul 04 10:20:13 <ericwill>	akurtakov what is the procedure with this, do we fix it?
Jul 04 10:20:24 <akurtakov>	yeah, we would better fix it
Jul 04 10:20:40 <akurtakov>	ubuntu is one of the target environments
Jul 04 10:20:44 <akurtakov>	so it should work out of the box
Jul 04 10:21:06 <ericwill>	okay, I'll look into it
Jul 04 10:21:18 <ericwill>	can't wait for Ubuntu to start using GNOME :)
Jul 04 10:21:39 <akurtakov>	ericwill: well, and Adwaita (ideally)
Jul 04 10:21:48 <akurtakov>	ambience is an abomination :)
Jul 04 10:22:28 *	akurtakov can't get people liking the orange color randomly in the UI
Jul 04 10:22:32 <akurtakov>	is it still like that ?
Jul 04 10:22:38 <ericwill>	yes
Jul 04 10:22:41 <ericwill>	it is so ugly
Jul 04 10:22:43 <ericwill>	I can't stand it
Jul 04 10:23:39 <akurtakov>	seeing UI like that being liked makes me believe I can be a world class artist one day :)
Jul 04 10:24:37 <ipun|laptop>	akurtakov: I'd love to see that haha
Jul 04 10:24:39 <ericwill>	I don't who decided on orange, of all colors
Jul 04 10:24:44 <ericwill>	*I don't know
Jul 04 10:38:05 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so is backport branch open now? Do you know?
Jul 04 10:38:12 <akurtakov>	ipun: if ambience is designer work, I 'm leonardo da vinci :)
Jul 04 10:38:28 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: according to sravan , he needs few more hours
Jul 04 10:38:33 <akurtakov>	tbh, I don't know what is he doing 
Jul 04 10:38:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah, ok.
Jul 04 10:55:01 <akurtakov>	ericwill: it gets better and better :)
Jul 04 10:55:33 <ericwill>	akurtakov I am very curious as the cause of this
Jul 04 11:00:33 <ipun>	akurtakov: i should just call you alex da vinci from now on
Jul 04 11:01:04 <akurtakov>	ericwill: transparency or some color not initialized
Jul 04 11:01:25 <akurtakov>	look in the color tab in control example on ubuntu
Jul 04 11:01:38 <akurtakov>	some constant should be quite weird
Jul 04 11:01:40 <akurtakov>	 :)
Jul 04 11:03:47 <ericwill>	akurtakov that is what I am doing right now haha
Jul 04 11:09:30 <akurtakov>	ericwill: let me know of anything you find
Jul 04 11:09:57 <ericwill>	akurtakov system colors look normal
Jul 04 11:32:48 <ericwill>	akurtakov actually nvm, I was looking at the wrong thing. I found some breakages
Jul 04 12:02:47 <akurtakov>	ericwill: what it is ?
Jul 04 12:06:51 <ericwill>	akurtakov 7 system colors are broken, I am looking into the cause
Jul 04 12:07:06 <ericwill>	doesn't seem to be a transparency issue
Jul 04 12:07:11 <akurtakov>	good
Jul 04 12:07:20 <akurtakov>	that should be easier to fix
Jul 04 12:07:23 <ericwill>	yes
Jul 05 10:42:15 <ipun>	akurtakov: do you know what type of widget this diagram viewer is using? https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=517671
Jul 05 10:42:36 <akurtakov>	probably canvas

Jul 18 09:50:17 *	Now talking on #SWT
Jul 18 10:09:18 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hey Leo
Jul 18 10:09:26 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hello
Jul 18 10:09:32 <akurtakov>	how are things going ?
Jul 18 10:09:38 <lufimtse>	Good good. Whats up
Jul 18 10:09:51 <akurtakov>	do you have all the test machines setup?
Jul 18 10:10:28 <lufimtse>	~Sorta. Maven still doesn't read correct env on windows box. Only works if I hard-code it in feature.xml
Jul 18 10:10:41 <lufimtse>	me/Roland debugged yesterday a bit, but could not find root cause
Jul 18 10:10:44 <lufimtse>	yet...
Jul 18 10:10:52 <lufimtse>	but linux/cocoa work.
Jul 18 10:11:21 <akurtakov>	did Roland told you that the way tests are run is not with maven for upstream ?
Jul 18 10:11:53 <lufimtse>	on windows?
Jul 18 10:12:01 <lufimtse>	like via build.xml?
Jul 18 10:12:34 <lufimtse>	Essentially, I'm just looking to run jUnits programtically on windows in some form or fashion. 
Jul 18 10:12:44 <lufimtse>	doing it manually is very time consuming
Jul 18 10:13:29 <akurtakov>	via test.xml and testrunner
Jul 18 10:13:48 <lufimtse>	is it quick to setup or difficult? you know?
Jul 18 10:14:15 <lufimtse>	I fiddled around with test.xml very briefly, couldn't get it to work, something about missing libs. Did you ever get it working?
Jul 18 10:14:31 <akurtakov>	we have it in eclipse-tests.rpm in fedora
Jul 18 10:14:38 <akurtakov>	and Roland did a fair bit of work on it
Jul 18 10:14:45 <lufimtse>	that's interesting
Jul 18 10:14:48 <akurtakov>	what else are you up to?
Jul 18 10:15:16 <akurtakov>	anything else stopping ou from webkit2 work?
Jul 18 10:15:20 <lufimtse>	Bunch of patch reviews. E.g this one: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/22713/
Jul 18 10:15:26 <akurtakov>	any eta on it being feature complete ?
Jul 18 10:15:38 <lufimtse>	Just the testing business. 
Jul 18 10:15:49 <lufimtse>	after that webkit2's browser function
Jul 18 10:15:50 <akurtakov>	I ask as I don't wnat it to prolong and we miss the boat again :)
Jul 18 10:15:54 <lufimtse>	ah
Jul 18 10:15:55 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 18 10:15:56 <lufimtse>	ok, 
Jul 18 10:16:06 <lufimtse>	Ill prioritise webkit2's browser function
Jul 18 10:16:09 <lufimtse>	's return value
Jul 18 10:17:14 <akurtakov>	well, reviews are not that time consuming are they?
Jul 18 10:17:22 <lufimtse>	Some are :-)
Jul 18 10:17:33 <akurtakov>	I mean they are not taking more than 1-2 h from your day or they do?
Jul 18 10:17:56 <lufimtse>	Usually not, with some exceptions, 
Jul 18 10:18:00 *	akurtakov would be surprised if people are that fast with responses :)
Jul 18 10:18:10 <lufimtse>	the one above took me half a day or
Jul 18 10:18:16 <lufimtse>	had a memory leak in there
Jul 18 10:18:21 <lufimtse>	but good patch
Jul 18 10:18:27 <lufimtse>	it's for the highest voted swt linux bug
Jul 18 10:18:41 <lufimtse>	I'm also the tester for those 
Jul 18 10:19:19 <lufimtse>	For now I'll try to get something working for windows jUnits and focus on finishing of webkit, will pause other activities.
Jul 18 10:19:48 <akurtakov>	well, perfect wold be still doing other things but not for 1-2 h per day 
Jul 18 10:20:01 <akurtakov>	so nothing stops and waits :)
Jul 18 10:22:09 <akurtakov>	ericwill: what about you ?
Jul 18 10:22:19 <akurtakov>	color port looks good ?
Jul 18 10:22:35 <akurtakov>	I don't see the white background anymore
Jul 18 10:22:41 <akurtakov>	until not yesterday or today
Jul 18 10:23:21 <ericwill>	akurtakov there are some small issues on isolated themes, but yes regular GTK theme should be working nicely
Jul 18 10:23:26 <ericwill>	I am working on them now
Jul 18 10:24:41 <ericwill>	once the color issues are ironed out I am planning on starting with a11y work
Jul 18 10:24:53 <akurtakov>	ericwill: did you deal with tree stuff last year ?
Jul 18 10:25:08 <akurtakov>	ah, yes a11y - that beast :)
Jul 18 10:26:02 <ericwill>	akurtakov yeah I did a lot of tree fixes last year
Jul 18 10:26:15 <akurtakov>	ok, I'll probably open some fun stuff for you :)
Jul 18 10:26:35 <ericwill>	okay :P
Jul 18 11:09:13 <akurtakov>	ericwill: lufimtse: it's that time when we should do planning for Photon
Jul 18 11:09:19 <akurtakov>	for SWT
Jul 18 11:09:29 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Jul 18 11:09:42 <akurtakov>	so Webkit2 by default, A11y
Jul 18 11:10:19 <akurtakov>	what about Notifications? or Opengl?
Jul 18 11:11:12 <ericwill>	akurtakov I was going to ask you about notifications
Jul 18 11:11:16 <ericwill>	I'd be interested in working on that
Jul 18 12:39:44 <akurtakov>	ericwill|lunch: lufimtse: do you think it's reasonable expectation to get all these done by March ?
Jul 18 12:44:16 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I would need to evaluate Opengl work to figure out how long it would take. Evaluating might take a while as I have not worked with OpenGL before, 
Jul 18 12:44:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I can say Webkit2 be done.
Jul 18 12:44:24 <lufimtse>	thou.
Jul 18 12:46:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov hard to say, a11y is so big and I am not sure what exactly is the issue there
Jul 18 12:46:30 <ericwill>	could take me a long/short time
Jul 18 12:46:50 <akurtakov>	I see
Jul 18 12:47:05 <akurtakov>	I'll try to get notifications started soonish
Jul 18 12:47:20 <akurtakov>	and get at least initial POC for gtk
Jul 18 12:48:20 *	akurtakov hopes to start next week after catching up post vacations
Jul 18 13:54:15 <ericwill>	akurtakov do you know anything about this THEME_BACKGROUND state in Widget.java?
Jul 18 13:54:26 <ericwill>	I asked about it on the mailing lists but no one answered
Jul 18 14:51:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: sorry, nothing I remember
Jul 18 14:54:03 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay, np
Jul 18 15:14:08 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, any progress on the gdk warnings?
Jul 18 15:15:09 <ericwill>	akurtakov no, I kind of ran into a wall on that issue. GTK complains about size being below min size, but all the fixes I've attempted have broken little things elsewhere
Jul 18 15:15:31 <akurtakov>	hmm ok
Jul 18 15:23:11 <ericwill>	akurtakov it's still on my list, I'll revisit it later after thinking about it some more
Jul 18 15:23:17 <akurtakov>	ok

Jul 20 10:18:58 <akurtakov>	^^ looks like your stuff :)
Jul 20 10:22:38 <ericwill>	akurtakov hmm okay, will investigate
Jul 20 10:22:53 <akurtakov>	ericwill: 3.14 is this AFAIK
Jul 20 10:25:41 <ericwill>	yes I believe so
Jul 20 10:29:55 <ericwill>	akurtakov btw I made some progress on the warnings yesterday
Jul 20 10:29:59 <ericwill>	without changes in os_custom.c
Jul 20 10:30:05 <ericwill>	looks promising
Jul 20 10:30:33 <akurtakov>	ericwill: nice, I can't wait to see less of these :)
Jul 20 10:38:38 <akurtakov>	ericwill: everyone sees this today https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.ui-Gerrit/13231/testReport/ :)
Jul 20 10:39:47 <ericwill>	akurtakov I think I know what is causing the issue, won't take me long to fix
Jul 20 10:47:50 <akurtakov>	ericwill: good :)
Jul 20 10:47:57 <akurtakov>	I'll keep bugging :)
Jul 20 11:07:34 <ericwill>	akurtakov fixed it

Jul 20 12:15:35 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I'll take a looks
Jul 20 12:15:44 <akurtakov>	cool, thanks
Jul 20 12:26:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Hey. Do you know, for backports, do I need to bump service version for every commit, or only once per 4.7.x release? e.g https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/99982/3
Jul 20 12:26:37 <akurtakov>	only once
Jul 20 12:26:44 <lufimtse>	thx
Jul 20 17:30:05 <ericwill>	akurtakov that latest comment on the CDT hover bug...so is it a GTK theme problem?
Jul 21 08:49:19 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hey Eric
Jul 21 08:49:26 <akurtakov>	any progress on the white background
Jul 21 08:49:58 <ericwill>	akurtakov you mean the debug  hover thing that Andrey reported? I am looking into it now
Jul 21 08:50:10 <akurtakov>	ericwill: fwiw, mylyn notifications on first appearance seems to have wrong background 
Jul 21 08:50:14 <akurtakov>	fixes after that
Jul 21 08:51:31 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yeah the debug hover
Jul 21 08:52:30 <ericwill>	akurtakov I am investigating. I can see some sort of issue with 3.14 on Fedora, but it's not unreadable. I have a RHEL 7.2 VM I can try with as well
Jul 21 08:52:52 <akurtakov>	ericwill: AFAIK Andrey uses kde 
Jul 21 08:52:56 <akurtakov>	any maybe gtk2 :)
Jul 21 08:53:46 <ericwill>	I think now he is using RHEL 7.2 with GTK3.14
Jul 21 08:53:50 <ericwill>	but he uses non-Adwaita theme
Jul 21 08:54:25 <akurtakov>	ok
Jul 21 08:57:14 <ericwill>	akurtakov these debug hovers are still supposed to be black, right? they didn't get changed to white
Jul 21 08:57:17 <ericwill>	in platform UI?
Jul 21 08:57:24 <akurtakov>	I think so
Jul 21 08:57:47 <akurtakov>	well, probably it depends on the debugging plugin in question
Jul 21 08:58:02 <akurtakov>	as I can ensure you the dltk.ruby one does nasty things :)
Jul 21 08:58:56 <ericwill>	ha
Jul 21 08:59:01 <ericwill>	okay that is what I thought as well
Jul 21 08:59:12 <ericwill>	not seeing the bug on Fedora, let me try RHEL with his theme
Jul 21 09:09:44 <ericwill>	thought I had a RHEL 7.2 VM, turns out it's actually RHEL 7.4
Jul 21 09:09:45 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 21 09:10:03 <ericwill>	let me try with this theme on Fedora
Jul 21 09:10:08 <ericwill>	*his theme
Jul 21 09:10:33 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I added you on cc to one bug yesterdya
Jul 21 09:10:44 <akurtakov>	it was about some color not being parsed from some theme
Jul 21 09:11:00 <akurtakov>	could be smth similar
Jul 21 09:11:17 <ericwill>	the CDT hover bug right?
Jul 21 09:11:28 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yea
Jul 21 09:14:52 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 21 10:34:27 <ericwill>	lufimtse heya, are you on PTO next week?
Jul 21 10:34:38 <lufimtse>	I have training
Jul 21 10:34:44 <lufimtse>	./forgot to mention.
Jul 21 10:34:45 <lufimtse>	Will do.
Jul 21 10:36:13 <ericwill>	so you are on PTO next week?
Jul 21 10:37:19 <lufimtse>	It's not counted as vaccation days. 
Jul 21 10:37:30 <lufimtse>	but in that sense, yes 
Jul 21 10:37:42 <lufimtse>	I'll be back friday 1 pm

Jul 21 10:38:27 <ericwill>	:)
Jul 21 10:39:36 <lufimtse>	ericwill, can you check the eclipse calendar, does my PTO show up for next week?
Jul 21 10:40:19 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hmm, are you taking PTO to take RHCSA ?
Jul 21 10:40:40 <ericwill>	lufimtse yes I see it on the calendar now
Jul 21 10:41:17 <lufimtse>	akurtakov it's a training instructor lead course
Jul 21 10:41:18 <lufimtse>	yes
Jul 21 10:44:02 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I asked Martha to check with you
Jul 21 10:44:15 <akurtakov>	but taking courses shouldn't cost you PTO :)
Jul 21 10:44:51 <lufimtse>	ok, confusion. I"m not taking PTO, but I'm doing the course and I won't be in the office.
Jul 21 10:45:14 <ericwill>	yeah sorry about that, I should have said "away" instead of PTO :)
Jul 21 10:45:55 <akurtakov>	ok :)
Jul 21 10:46:11 <akurtakov>	I just make sure things are clear :)
Jul 21 10:47:37 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Thanks for clarification. I mixed up PTO with OOO. I thought PTO==OOO.
Jul 21 10:47:40 <lufimtse>	I updated calendar 
Jul 21 10:47:51 <lufimtse>	"OOO - Leo Ufimtsev"
Jul 21 10:48:07 *	akurtakov doesn't want people in the team to lose PTO for work related things :)
Jul 21 11:22:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Are we good to merge: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/85603/4 ?
Jul 21 11:22:15 <lufimtse>	I removed pom.xml
Jul 21 11:22:20 <lufimtse>	changes
Jul 21 11:22:23 <lufimtse>	and added ignore
Jul 21 11:22:27 <lufimtse>	and clarified assert
Jul 21 11:42:01 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: looks like it
Jul 21 13:13:30 <ericwill>	lufimtse do you have time to review one of my patches today?

Jul 28 15:56:40 <lufimtse>	ericwill, yea, I just saw. My jni talk also got accepted.
Jul 28 15:56:49 <lufimtse>	ericwill, next week we be busy.
Jul 28 15:59:16 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I just noticed that gerrit kinda feels like gmail. Like if you press shift+?, the same keyboard help pops up. Most of the keyboard shortcuts are the same. Gerrit was made by google I think, which kinda explains it.
Jul 28 16:02:43 <ericwill>	hmm, good to know

Aug 01 11:13:15 <akurtakov>	it's really rare
Aug 01 11:13:20 <akurtakov>	do you use mylyn?
Aug 01 11:13:34 <ericwill>	I have the task list installed for testing some things but I don't really use it at all
Aug 01 11:13:36 <akurtakov>	mylyn notifications seems to be the most common 
Aug 01 11:13:52 <ericwill>	hmm I'll look into it
Aug 01 11:14:01 <ericwill>	this bug is very elusive :)
Aug 01 14:54:00 <ericwill>	akurtakov I wrote a script that pulls in the daily I-build test results and parses them for failures
Aug 01 14:54:09 <ericwill>	so you don't have to email me when the e4 tests fail or something
Aug 01 14:58:14 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, I just check the web :)

Aug 02 15:06:35 <ipun>	lufimtse: when you were working on webkit, did you do anything related to user-agents/
Aug 02 15:06:48 <lufimtse>	ipun, no
Aug 04 11:33:31 <ericwill>	lufimtse fixed those issues you filed today, only one left to handle is the test names without stacktraces
Aug 04 11:33:40 <ericwill>	thank you for the feedback :)

Aug 08 09:58:32 <ericwill>	akurtakov which version of Eclipse started enforcing GTK3 by default? Mars?
Aug 08 09:59:17 <akurtakov>	the one from 2014 :)
Aug 08 10:00:22 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I think it was Luna :)
Aug 08 10:01:44 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay thanks
Aug 08 10:01:53 <ericwill>	akurtakov did you see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=470031#c23 ?
Aug 08 10:02:16 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yeah, but I was waiting on your reaction :)
Aug 08 10:02:36 <ericwill>	I will tell him what I know so far and see what he says
Aug 09 11:28:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hey Eric
Aug 09 11:28:32 <akurtakov>	so you're moving on with accessibility stuff
Aug 09 11:28:41 <akurtakov>	do you have better idea what's going on ?
Aug 09 11:28:52 <ericwill>	akurtakov I haven't heard anything yet from Sravan
Aug 09 11:28:56 <ericwill>	eh..a little :)
Aug 09 11:30:43 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, I would not push too much but I'm just curious
Aug 09 11:32:05 <ericwill>	akurtakov how the SWT a11y code interacts with GTK is still a mystery to me
Aug 09 11:32:11 <ericwill>	that's what I am trying to figure out now
Aug 09 11:37:32 <akurtakov>	g'luck :)
Aug 09 11:38:22 <ericwill>	ha, thanks :P
Aug 09 12:00:45 <akurtakov>	guys, everything you want for 4.7.1 must be in this week 
Aug 09 12:00:46 <akurtakov>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=517487

Aug 09 12:01:26 <akurtakov>	^^ these both look good
Aug 09 12:02:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill|lunch: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=481824 for 4.8 I would say?
Aug 09 12:02:23 <akurtakov>	ericwill|lunch: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=470031 same?
Aug 09 12:20:44 <ericwill>	akurtakov yeah for 4.8 sure
Aug 09 12:20:58 <akurtakov>	ericwill: please retarget 
Aug 09 12:30:57 <ericwill>	akurtakov done
Aug 09 12:31:04 <akurtakov>	thanks
Aug 09 12:31:13 <akurtakov>	why do we have a release every week :)
Aug 09 12:31:23 <akurtakov>	I can barely keep up with the dates :)
Aug 09 12:33:20 <ericwill>	yeah
Aug 09 12:33:24 <ericwill>	I try to backport my stuff ASAP to avoid forgetting about these things
Aug 09 14:48:15 <lufimtse_>	ericwill, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/60704/
Aug 09 14:48:26 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, hudson builds seem to be failing as of: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/60704/
Aug 09 14:49:00 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: I simply removed it as reviewer and pushed https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/102801/
Aug 09 14:49:07 <akurtakov>	if it's only this failure
Aug 09 14:49:22 <akurtakov>	Niraj merged fix and test change together
Aug 09 14:50:02 <lufimtse_>	I see
Aug 09 14:50:06 <lufimtse_>	so wait till tomorrow?
Aug 09 14:50:22 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: if there is just this failure, remove hudson as reviewer and push
Aug 09 14:50:33 <akurtakov>	I'm tired of waiting for stuff :)
Aug 09 14:50:33 <lufimtse_>	I see
Aug 09 14:50:37 <lufimtse_>	ok
Aug 09 14:50:47 <akurtakov>	we have lost too much time trying to play nice :)
Aug 09 14:52:16 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: I've changed the config of the hudson job to publish the junit results to it's easier (one click away) to spot the failing tests now :)
Aug 09 14:56:32 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, you mean when you open the hudson build, click on the "Test Result" next to the clipboard?
Aug 09 14:58:36 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: yes, it wasn't there for older builds https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.swt-Gerrit/5087/ 
Aug 09 15:03:15 <lufimtse_>	oh
Aug 09 15:03:19 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, very useful
Aug 09 15:03:20 <lufimtse_>	thank you
Aug 09 15:03:44 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, btw, I don't seem to have rights to remove hudson. Should I be having those?
Aug 09 15:03:53 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: you should be able
Aug 09 15:03:58 <akurtakov>	how do you try to do it?
Aug 09 15:04:17 <lufimtse_>	there is no "x" next to hudson
Aug 09 15:04:27 <lufimtse_>	but there is one next to my name
Aug 09 15:05:00 <akurtakov>	hmm, no idea
Aug 09 15:05:08 <akurtakov>	every committer should be able to do it
Aug 09 15:05:15 <akurtakov>	please ask ericwill to try
Aug 09 15:05:31 <lufimtse_>	ericwill, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/98260/
Aug 09 15:05:47 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, Eric cannot
Aug 09 15:05:48 <ericwill>	I can't
Aug 09 15:05:50 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, can you?
Aug 09 15:06:05 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, maybe I need to request some permissions
Aug 09 15:06:06 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: I do it for my gerrits
Aug 09 15:06:13 <akurtakov>	which one do  you want me to try ?
Aug 09 15:06:16 <lufimtse_>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/98260/
Aug 09 15:07:24 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, I can remove Eric, but not Hudson
Aug 09 15:07:39 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: I removed it
Aug 09 15:07:50 <akurtakov>	well, open bz
Aug 09 15:08:02 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, ok
Aug 09 15:08:05 <akurtakov>	I seriously thought every committer was able to do it
Aug 09 16:04:58 <lufimtse_>	ipun, have you tested this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/100078/ with regular ccombo boxes that don't have read only property?
Aug 09 16:05:29 <ipun>	lufimtse_: no I havent, but thast a good case 
Aug 09 16:05:35 <ipun>	ill see what inheriently GTK does
Aug 09 16:06:03 <lufimtse_>	I'll post into gerrit review. When tested, please post your findings into the gerrit review and I'll test on other platforms.
Aug 09 16:11:53 <ipun>	lufimtse_: oh wait nevermind, ive definitely tested this with regular combo boxes. I read your comment wrong
Aug 09 16:12:02 <ipun>	I thought you meant testing it on regular "combo" boxes
Aug 09 17:06:39 <lufimtse_>	no, I mean ccombo not read only
Aug 10 10:20:21 <ipun>	lufimtse_: how did you access git through your windows machine?
Aug 10 10:20:30 <ipun>	this is paaiinnffull
Aug 10 10:40:18 <lufimtse_>	ipun,   remember to   cd /mnt/c/git/
Aug 10 10:40:39 <ipun>	lufimtse_: yeah i got it working thanks! Tested on all platforms and ready for merge
Aug 10 10:42:38 <lufimtse_>	ipun, r u done with mac?
Aug 10 10:43:26 <ipun>	lufimtse_: yes
Aug 10 13:03:07 <lufimtse_>	ipun, hey ya, any chance you could review the patch here? https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=520442  you seem to know your way around styledText 
Aug 10 13:04:22 <ipun>	lufimtse_: sure. I don't see this being any issue unless the builds are failing but ill review it
Aug 10 13:10:09 <ipun>	lufimtse_: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=304893 whos carolyn?
Aug 10 13:11:00 <ipun>	oh wait nvm shes the QA, ignore
Aug 10 13:11:17 <ericwill>	she's from IBM but doesn't work on Eclipse anymore
Aug 10 13:11:20 <ericwill>	I'd remove her from QA
Aug 10 13:11:27 <ericwill>	I doubt you'll get a response
Aug 10 13:36:20 <ipun>	ericwill: thanks, ive done so now
Aug 10 15:13:50 <ipun>	lufimtse_: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=304893
Aug 10 15:13:54 <ipun>	no QA for this one

Sep 26 09:38:30 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: here?
Sep 26 09:38:45 <akurtakov>	I can reproduce it 100%
Sep 26 09:38:53 <akurtakov>	but have hard time finding out 
Sep 26 09:39:01 <akurtakov>	the root cause
Sep 26 09:39:05 <akurtakov>	if only there was java part pointing to the issue
Sep 26 09:39:29 <akurtakov>	my gut feeling is some race 
Sep 26 09:43:34 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 26 09:43:54 <lufimtse>	I'll upgrade my webkit package to see if I can reproduce the issue.
Sep 26 09:44:10 <lufimtse>	or upgrade to f27...
Sep 26 10:29:50 <akurtakov>	or use a vm 
Sep 26 10:37:42 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I have just tested with orca
Sep 26 10:37:48 <akurtakov>	and I got some content read
Sep 26 10:37:51 <akurtakov>	pretty nice
Sep 26 10:38:28 <ericwill>	akurtakov :) there are some pieces missing, but basic support is there + no crashing/hanging
Sep 26 10:38:33 <ericwill>	I am going to write a blog post and tweet about it
Sep 26 10:39:39 <akurtakov>	ericwill: cool
Sep 26 10:39:46 <akurtakov>	buttons are not yet read, right?
Sep 26 10:40:48 <ericwill>	which buttons
Sep 26 10:41:20 <ericwill>	they should be, if they have focus or are clicked
Sep 26 10:42:46 <akurtakov>	I tried with Snippet 20
Sep 26 10:43:51 <ericwill>	might be because it is a child of coolbar
Sep 26 10:44:03 <ericwill>	the support for emulated widgets is still a work in progress
Sep 26 10:44:08 <akurtakov>	ok, I see
Sep 26 11:10:41 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: any clue for that 
Sep 26 11:10:44 <akurtakov>	bug
Sep 26 11:10:51 <akurtakov>	we have 1a rc2 this week
Sep 26 11:12:27 <lufimtse>	I've done an initial scan of things, can't see anything obvious wrong :-\
Sep 26 11:12:31 <lufimtse>	May take a while.
Sep 26 11:12:50 <lufimtse>	100% of my attention is on fixing this crasher first thou. 
Sep 26 11:15:09 <lufimtse>	btw
Sep 26 11:15:15 <lufimtse>	do you know much about rawhide-debuginfo?
Sep 26 11:15:38 <lufimtse>	Is there a way to install a webkitgtk4 with debug infos of sorts, that would give me more info
Sep 26 11:15:50 <lufimtse>	I noticed my stack trace is much more generic than the one that you posted,
Sep 26 11:16:43 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I attached to the process with gdb
Sep 26 11:17:11 <akurtakov>	and generated the backtrace from there after the sigkill
Sep 26 11:17:45 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: so I'm speaking to get the fix in 1a if we manage to make it soon enough
Sep 26 11:17:51 <akurtakov>	so I'm looking into it also
Sep 26 11:17:57 <akurtakov>	but so far not a clue
Sep 26 11:19:51 <lufimtse>	Let me try to attach as you did.
Sep 26 11:25:28 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I now remember that gdb produces better output if I download the ".debug" packages. Forgot about those. Will investigate.
Sep 26 11:58:51 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: better with gdb attach ?
Sep 26 12:02:24 <lufimtse>	I've installed a bunch of debug libs and can debug the crash on the webkit side a bit.
Sep 26 12:02:26 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Sep 26 12:02:34 <lufimtse>	investigating now..
Sep 26 12:02:53 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I'm done for now, please send me an email so hopefully I can pick up tomorrow
Sep 26 12:03:00 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok

Sep 27 10:00:21 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, morning
Sep 27 10:01:56 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I typed up a comment in the bug, but forgot to submit it yesteday. Posted it just now.
Sep 27 10:02:13 <lufimtse>	I have a workaround to fix crash, but currently investigating root cause.
Sep 27 11:08:30 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hey 
Sep 27 11:08:43 <akurtakov>	I wonder why the container_add causes it
Sep 27 11:08:57 <lufimtse>	my theory is that during display dispose, it disposes webkit
Sep 27 11:09:01 <lufimtse>	then webkit tries to dispose again
Sep 27 11:09:09 <lufimtse>	display disposes recursivley down...
Sep 27 11:09:10 <lufimtse>	maybe
Sep 27 11:11:07 <lufimtse>	As a sidenode, the coverage tool helped a lot narrowing down code that ran and code that didn't
Sep 27 11:14:44 <akurtakov>	well, display dispose should end up calling browser dispose
Sep 27 11:14:52 <akurtakov>	which should dispose webkit
Sep 27 11:15:01 <akurtakov>	and webkit shouldn't try to dispose later
Sep 27 11:15:22 <lufimtse>	*shouldn't* :-)
Sep 27 11:16:06 <lufimtse>	In the exit handler, in jvm, it seems gblib-c does a call like "g_object_unref(webView)"
Sep 27 11:16:10 <lufimtse>	I'm curious as to why...
Sep 27 11:16:25 <akurtakov>	what calls it ?
Sep 27 11:16:26 <lufimtse>	That call then triggers the assertion
Sep 27 11:17:09 <lufimtse>	__libc_start_main ... __run_exit_handlers () ... g_object_unref(..)
Sep 27 11:17:25 <lufimtse>	I need to investigate these exit handlers manybe
Sep 27 11:20:31 <akurtakov>	hmm if it's webkit own exit handler
Sep 27 11:20:41 <akurtakov>	maybe we shouldn't dispose it ourself
Sep 27 11:20:58 <lufimtse>	hmm
Sep 27 11:21:00 <lufimtse>	may be the case
Sep 27 11:21:24 <lufimtse>	I looked into glib's exit.c, it's basically a mechanism to run clean-up tasks after main loop finishes
Sep 27 11:21:33 <lufimtse>	it runs functions that were registered there
Sep 27 11:21:43 <lufimtse>	(who registered cleanup function I wonder...)
Sep 27 11:21:49 <lufimtse>	maybe they added that in webkit
Sep 27 11:26:50 <akurtakov>	yeah, that would be my geuss
Sep 27 11:27:29 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I'll tinker around with native snippets. I'll also investigate if we can somehow prevent display disposing webkit if added as container etc...
Sep 27 13:34:33 <akurtakov>	ipun: here?
Sep 27 13:43:18 <ericwill>	akurtakov he left his machine in the office on, he isn't here
Sep 27 13:48:02 <akurtakov>	was he in the office lately ?
Sep 27 13:48:38 <ericwill>	nope, he moved back to Vancouver for school
Sep 27 13:58:37 <akurtakov>	ok, I thought so but wondered cause of irc :)
Sep 27 16:00:41 <ericwill>	lufimtse https://www.eclipse.org/articles/swt-design-2/sleak.htm
Sep 28 11:58:11 <akurtakov>	hey guys
Sep 28 11:58:20 <akurtakov>	ready for quick chat ?
Sep 29 12:09:04 <lufimtse>	Eric works from home today
Sep 29 12:09:10 <lufimtse>	maybe monday?
Sep 29 12:19:59 <ericwill>	lufimtse what was the question?
Sep 29 12:20:19 <lufimtse>	ericwill, Alex suggested a small chat between the 3 of us. 
Sep 29 12:20:27 <lufimtse>	ericwill, probably monday after meeting.
Sep 29 12:20:46 <ericwill>	lufimtse sure, sounds good

Oct 12 14:15:27 <ipun>	it gets to 50% in about 2 minutes, but after that its going at 1% per minute
Oct 12 14:15:53 <ipun>	connection gets dropped to 10KiB/s. Tried this at home and at school with the same problem
Oct 12 14:19:54 <ericwill>	whoa, it's ipun 
Oct 12 14:19:55 <ericwill>	hey man
Oct 12 14:19:59 <ericwill>	could be slow servers?
Oct 12 14:20:25 <ipun>	no idea
Oct 12 14:20:32 <ipun>	im posting on eclipse dev now
Oct 12 14:20:42 <ipun>	its been like this for the past week
Oct 12 14:21:21 <ericwill>	IIRC last time I did a pull on the binaries repo it took forever as well
Oct 12 14:23:10 <ipun>	fack
Oct 12 14:24:50 <ipun>	okay this is rediculous
Oct 12 14:24:56 <ipun>	i might have to run it overnight
Oct 12 14:25:02 <ipun>	I was suppose to do work today...
Oct 12 14:25:52 <ericwill>	well there is always the unexpected :P
Oct 12 14:27:27 *	ipun shrugs
Oct 12 14:27:34 <ipun>	nice chatting! Back to school it is then
Oct 12 14:28:47 <ericwill>	cool, see you later
Oct 13 14:58:15 <lufimtse>	ericwill, btw, will you add slides for the projects, or will you just talk about them?
Oct 13 14:59:06 <ericwill>	lufimtse was going to discuss that on Monday
Oct 13 14:59:24 <lufimtse>	ok-hey
Oct 13 14:59:27 <ericwill>	I think we should put general instructions/ideas on the slides but let the people look through the code and help them
Oct 13 15:39:21 <lufimtse>	ericwill, hmm. I'll prepare things for the USB stick, but just in case we find something on monday, I won't copy stuff onto them today but will do monday after we did the practice run.
Oct 13 15:48:02 <ericwill>	lufimtse yes sounds good to me
Oct 13 15:49:52 <ericwill>	alright I'm off, enjoy your weekend :)

Nov 08 10:40:50 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, rgrunber 
Nov 08 10:41:14 <lufimtse_>	So Roland pointed out that webkit2gtk will introduce cookie management api (probably) in 2.20 (next release).
Nov 08 10:41:28 <lufimtse_>	Which we would need to port set/get cookie api in Browser.java
Nov 08 10:41:51 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, do you think it's ok to have cookie api functionality only if you have webkit2 2.20?
Nov 08 10:41:57 <lufimtse_>	(set/get).
Nov 08 10:42:08 <lufimtse_>	I think clearSession api is available in earlier versions
Nov 08 10:42:24 <lufimtse_>	at the moment, I've never actually seen anyone use that api.
Nov 08 10:43:08 <lufimtse_>	The alternative is hacking into webkitgtk by the looks, which may be time consuming to implement.
Nov 08 10:44:07 <akurtakov>	sounds good tome
Nov 08 10:44:19 <akurtakov>	if clearSession can be done now let's do it
Nov 08 10:45:20 <akurtakov>	and please put a reference to the place where you get the info for set/get cookie coming in 2.20
Nov 08 10:46:06 <akurtakov>	another thing is libsoup
Nov 08 10:46:13 <akurtakov>	if needed we can call it direclty
Nov 08 10:46:49 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: there are bindings for many soup_* functions already
Nov 08 10:55:55 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, I think those can only be ran from a webextension
Nov 08 10:56:04 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, doable, but would require a bit of extra time,
Nov 08 10:56:20 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, the webkit2 api is free beer
Nov 08 10:56:30 <akurtakov>	?
Nov 08 10:56:49 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, afaki there are no soup api in webkit2 UI api
Nov 08 10:57:23 <lufimtse_>	at the moment
Nov 08 10:57:40 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, it's only becomming available in the upcomming patch
Nov 08 10:57:50 <akurtakov>	you mean you can't gain access to soupsessin from webkit2 api ?
Nov 08 14:07:59 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: yeah i believe so.. however webkit2 is storing the sessions undeneath, there is no api to access..
Nov 08 14:08:13 <rgrunber>	lufimtse_: fyi.. i just got '** (process:24929): WARNING **: Deleting cookies modified since a given time span is not supported yet' :P
Nov 08 14:08:51 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: where did the info for the new api in 2.20 comes from ?
Nov 08 14:09:25 <akurtakov>	is it in 2.19.1 ?
Nov 08 14:09:45 <rgrunber>	afaict the new api is only proposed at https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177932
Nov 08 14:36:24 <lufimtse_>	Lots of activity in that bug
Nov 09 13:44:40 <rgrunber>	anyone know why i'm getting NoClassDefFoundError: org/hamcrest/SelfDescribing when i try to run an swt test in Eclipse ? class should be in hamcrest-core which is in my TP.
Nov 09 14:56:49 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, hey
Nov 09 14:57:00 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, still around
Nov 09 14:57:01 <lufimtse_>	?
Nov 09 14:57:01 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: what's up
Nov 09 14:57:08 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, we are dropping 32 bit right?
Nov 09 14:57:16 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, will that mean that we'll weed out 32 bit form SWT?
Nov 09 14:57:16 <akurtakov>	not yet
Nov 09 14:57:38 <akurtakov>	photon will have 32 bit
Nov 09 14:58:06 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, I ran into a funky situation where SWT's 32/64 bit checking tool is getting confused. Just trying to figure out how much time to devote to that.
Nov 09 14:58:16 <akurtakov>	not much
Nov 09 14:58:18 <lufimtse_>	k
Nov 09 14:58:36 <akurtakov>	as soon as eclipse requires java 9 as min we will drop it
Nov 09 14:58:48 <akurtakov>	it would be good day for swt
Nov 09 14:59:02 <akurtakov>	esp with getting rid of all long /*int*/ insanity :)

Nov 21 13:03:44 <ericwill>	akurtakov do you know why CTable was created? Which limitation is it trying to overcome?
Nov 21 13:07:35 <ericwill>	I am just curious
Nov 21 13:43:34 <akurtakov>	ericwill: no idea
Nov 21 13:43:45 <akurtakov>	they were created at the time of motif :)
Nov 21 13:43:53 <akurtakov>	aka prior to gtk 1.x
Nov 21 13:43:57 *	akurtakov is not that old
Nov 21 13:44:03 <ericwill>	haha
Nov 21 13:44:10 <ericwill>	I ask because even GTK2 CTable a11y stuff is broken
Nov 21 13:44:15 <ericwill>	and getting GTK3 to work will be a headache
Nov 21 13:44:23 <akurtakov>	just ignore in this case :)
Nov 21 13:44:30 <ericwill>	kk
Nov 21 13:44:32 <akurtakov>	CTabFolder is what matters
Nov 21 13:44:46 <ericwill>	agreed, and afaict no one is using CTable anyways
Nov 21 13:47:18 <akurtakov>	yup
Nov 21 13:47:58 <akurtakov>	it's worth checking whether anything that CTable can do can't be done with Table
Nov 21 13:48:15 <akurtakov>	and even officially deprecate it if everything is possible with plain Table
Nov 21 13:49:34 <ericwill>	that's why I was asking about why it even exists :)
Nov 21 13:50:57 <akurtakov>	hmm
Nov 21 13:50:59 <akurtakov>	wait a bit
Nov 21 13:51:02 <akurtakov>	I just checked
Nov 21 13:51:08 <akurtakov>	there is no CTable 
Nov 21 13:52:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill: http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse%20SWT%20Custom%20Widgets/common/org/eclipse/swt/custom 
Nov 21 13:52:34 <akurtakov>	ericwill: which component do you actually speak of ?
Nov 21 13:53:51 <ericwill>	ah it is in org.eclipse.swt.examples
Nov 21 13:53:55 <ericwill>	not even a widget
Nov 21 13:53:56 <ericwill>	derp
Nov 21 13:54:12 <ericwill>	in this case I can definitely skip it
Nov 21 13:55:43 <akurtakov>	ericwill: it's worth trying 
Nov 21 13:56:03 <akurtakov>	whether we can migrate CLabel with Label in aggregator.build
Nov 21 13:57:04 <ericwill>	yeah, I think Lakshmi was telling me that CLabel only exists because of a Win32 limitation
Nov 21 13:57:11 <ericwill>	on GTK we don't need it
Nov 21 13:57:38 <akurtakov>	ericwill: any pointer to that
Nov 21 13:57:44 <akurtakov>	what about CCombo?
Nov 21 13:58:15 <ericwill>	idk about CCombo
Nov 21 13:58:25 <ericwill>	if you look at the javadoc for CLabel, it talks about images and border styles
Nov 21 13:58:30 <ericwill>	which is all possible in GTK
Nov 21 13:59:34 <ericwill>	but afaict, the biggest benefit of CLabel is image + text at the same time
Nov 21 13:59:50 <ericwill>	which on GTK has been done for years :)
Nov 21 14:00:26 <akurtakov>	hmm
Nov 21 14:00:39 <akurtakov>	I'm surprised that windows doesn't support such thing
Nov 21 14:02:01 *	ericwill shrugs
Nov 21 14:02:06 <ericwill>	I don't know much about windows SWT
Nov 21 14:03:06 <akurtakov>	weirdly enough
Nov 21 14:03:18 <akurtakov>	Label doesn't document it's image or text
Nov 21 14:03:50 <akurtakov>	ok, it's there but only as "a string or image"
Nov 21 14:05:41 <ericwill>	hmm
Nov 21 14:07:18 <ericwill>	in Label, we are hiding the imageHandle whenever the text is set
Nov 21 14:07:28 <ericwill>	and vice versa
Nov 21 14:08:24 <ericwill>	I commented them out and setting an image and text works
Nov 21 14:09:49 <ericwill>	it would require some patching but it wouldn't be that much work
Nov 21 14:19:12 <akurtakov>	ericwill: we have to find out win32
Nov 21 14:19:18 <akurtakov>	before trying to add it
Nov 21 14:21:09 <ericwill>	right
Nov 21 14:39:10 <akurtakov>	ericwill: how are things with a11y ?
Nov 21 14:40:03 <ericwill>	akurtakov good, on the last set of interfaces to implement. then I have look at handling children in a better way and test out CTabFolder thoroughly
Nov 21 14:40:41 <ericwill>	ideally I want it all wrapped by M5 so I can move onto other things
Nov 21 14:40:47 <ericwill>	*wrapped up
Nov 21 14:43:02 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok
Nov 21 14:43:24 <akurtakov>	feel free to take few days on bugfixing when you need break from it
Nov 21 14:47:56 <ericwill>	sounds good to me
Nov 21 15:04:43 <akurtakov>	ericwill: is http://eclipse.etherpad.corp.redhat.com/38 fully uptodate?

Nov 24 11:10:07 <akurtakov>	well, what can I say
Nov 24 11:11:53 <ericwill>	after Andrey posted...I am not sure this is even an Eclipse bug
Nov 24 11:12:01 <ericwill>	it looks like they are just complaining about their theme?
Nov 24 11:12:18 *	ericwill is confused
Nov 24 11:24:17 <akurtakov>	I replied

Nov 24 11:29:53 <ericwill>	akurtakov I don't blame you
Nov 24 11:30:49 <ericwill>	I didn't expect these types of comments from Andrey
Nov 24 11:33:52 <akurtakov>	well, expect the unexpected 
Nov 24 11:42:18 <akurtakov>	ericwill: frustrated ?
Nov 24 11:43:26 <ericwill>	akurtakov a bit
Nov 24 11:43:38 <akurtakov>	ericwill: grow a thick skin 
Nov 24 11:43:41 <ericwill>	more frustrated with Thomas Singer earlier in the week than I am with Andrey
Nov 24 11:43:47 <ericwill>	but I am starting to ignore these people
Nov 24 11:43:48 <ericwill>	yeah
Nov 24 11:43:58 <akurtakov>	and never let them have the last word :)
Nov 24 11:44:15 <akurtakov>	counter attack and blame them for being "freeloaders" :)
Nov 24 11:44:22 <akurtakov>	indirectly of course :)
Nov 24 11:45:08 <akurtakov>	let it be obvious to everyone but never use imperative style :)
Nov 24 11:45:51 <ericwill>	:)
Nov 24 11:52:58 <ericwill>	does anyone know what the keybinding is for switching editor tabs in Eclipse?
Nov 24 11:54:37 <ericwill>	like send focus to the editor tab
Nov 24 11:54:41 <ericwill>	I tried Ctrl + Tab, no good
Nov 24 11:58:41 <ericwill>	ah I figured it out, Ctrl + Shift + Tab
Nov 24 12:22:40 <akurtakov>	ericwill: so we almost have Andrey in defense now
Nov 24 12:23:31 <ericwill>	akurtakov yeah at EclipseCon he even agreed that supporting anything below GTK3.22 wasn't worth the time
Nov 24 12:30:08 <akurtakov>	ericwill: what do you think about his proposal
Nov 24 12:30:32 <akurtakov>	I don't see a reason why what's passed with vmargs shouldn't override the builtin css
Nov 24 12:34:49 <ericwill>	me neither
Nov 24 12:36:14 <ericwill>	at the same time, idk how I feel about people inserting their own CSS into SWT
Nov 24 12:36:18 <ericwill>	it could be wrong, lead to bugs, etc.
Nov 24 12:36:59 <akurtakov>	ericwill: same with themes :)
Nov 24 12:39:53 <ericwill>	yeah
Nov 24 12:40:01 <ericwill>	I am not against it
Nov 24 12:51:16 <ericwill>	akurtakov in other news, I just merged a patch that fixes CTabFolder a11y

Nov 29 11:05:30 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hey Eric
Nov 29 11:06:10 <akurtakov>	so do you look at editor annotation column or at color port in general or at the white background issue
Nov 29 11:06:15 <akurtakov>	or you think they are one and the same
Nov 29 11:10:50 <akurtakov>	it is interesting to enhance the background tests to catch such issues
Nov 29 11:35:01 <ericwill>	akurtakov hey sorry, I somehow missed the IRC notification
Nov 29 11:35:25 <ericwill>	they are one in the same
Nov 29 11:35:40 <ericwill>	pre-color port there was a lot of hacky stuff going on behind the scenes with colors
Nov 29 11:35:46 <ericwill>	I am trying to make sense of it and clean it up
Nov 29 11:36:00 <ericwill>	things like PARENT_BACKGROUND style bits which have no documentation
Nov 29 11:36:24 <ericwill>	but I believe I have almost fixed this latest regression, just testing now
Nov 29 11:36:51 <ericwill>	hard to test these things with JUnits as they aren't part of the public API and exist in weird corner cases
Nov 29 11:37:16 <akurtakov>	hmm
Nov 29 11:37:23 <akurtakov>	even with proper styles ?
Nov 29 11:38:27 <ericwill>	what do you mean
Nov 29 11:38:55 <akurtakov>	I mean you can pass PARENT_BACKGROUND as style
Nov 29 11:39:03 <akurtakov>	setBackground
Nov 29 11:39:12 <akurtakov>	and verify whether result is as expected
Nov 29 11:39:30 <ericwill>	PARENT_BACKGROUND isn't public, it exists in Widget
Nov 29 11:39:33 <ericwill>	not SWT.java
Nov 29 11:41:05 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yeah but this is controllable via Control.setBackgroundMode
Nov 29 11:41:22 <akurtakov>	and passing it the proper INHERIT_* constant
Nov 29 11:41:30 <akurtakov>	or not ?
Nov 29 11:41:37 <ericwill>	yes
Nov 29 11:41:41 <ericwill>	that is currently broken as well
Nov 29 11:41:47 <ericwill>	and was broken long before the color port
Nov 29 11:42:00 <ericwill>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=519416
Nov 29 11:42:02 <akurtakov>	ah I see
Nov 29 11:42:08 <ericwill>	I was hoping to work on this after a11y
Nov 29 11:42:20 <akurtakov>	ok
Nov 29 11:42:30 <ericwill>	from what I gather, in GTK2 (and probably Win32), there was no color inheritance
Nov 29 11:42:55 <ericwill>	so the fix to do it was to go up the widget tree and find the first widget that didn't have PARENT_BACKGROUND set, and steal its color
Nov 29 11:43:16 <ericwill>	of course in GTK3 this isn't really great, we can just do inheritance with transparency
Nov 29 12:01:56 <ericwill>	akurtakov quiet week for M4 is next week right?
Nov 29 12:02:01 <akurtakov>	yes

Dec 01 08:15:43 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hey
Dec 01 08:15:46 <akurtakov>	is Eric around ?
Dec 01 08:29:07 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hey Eric
Dec 01 08:29:27 <akurtakov>	another round of the color issue 
Dec 01 08:30:30 <ericwill>	akurtakov regression from the patch you pushed today?
Dec 01 08:30:35 <ericwill>	or separate
Dec 01 08:30:38 <akurtakov>	yes, see the bug
Dec 01 08:30:54 <akurtakov>	it happens even with themes enabled 
Dec 01 08:30:58 <akurtakov>	if you oopen form editor
Dec 01 08:31:09 <akurtakov>	the first time top level toolbar is gray
Dec 01 08:31:23 <akurtakov>	change the tabs
Dec 01 08:31:36 <akurtakov>	and it becomes white (which should have been the initial case)
Dec 01 08:33:01 <akurtakov>	ericwill: wdyt?
Dec 01 08:33:28 <akurtakov>	should we revert or you're going to fix it today ?
Dec 01 08:33:31 <akurtakov>	:)
Dec 01 08:33:50 <ericwill>	akurtakov in a call in Sopot atm, will take a look in 30 mins
Dec 01 08:34:31 <akurtakov>	ok
Dec 01 08:42:46 <akurtakov>	let me know when you're done
Dec 01 08:54:57 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay done
Dec 01 08:55:00 <ericwill>	let me take a look
Dec 01 08:56:33 <ericwill>	hmm
Dec 01 09:02:10 <ericwill>	akurtakov no guarantee I can fix this today, if I can get it done before lunch then I
Dec 01 09:02:16 <ericwill>	will push, if not I'll revert
Dec 01 09:03:58 <akurtakov>	ok
Dec 01 09:05:05 <akurtakov>	ericwill: please come up with tests for these theing
Dec 01 09:05:17 <akurtakov>	even if small parts we need some automation
Dec 01 09:06:47 <ericwill>	yes I will do that
Dec 01 09:06:54 <ericwill>	they might end up in the platform specific tests
Dec 01 09:07:00 <ericwill>	to start
Dec 01 09:07:18 <akurtakov>	hmm no
Dec 01 09:07:28 <akurtakov>	we need them to be run as part of the regular builds
Dec 01 09:07:36 <akurtakov>	otherwise they would just be lost
Dec 01 09:08:27 <ericwill>	okay
Dec 01 09:09:11 <ericwill>	akurtakov what do you think about using getData to return the contents of the GtkCSSProvider
Dec 01 09:09:17 <akurtakov>	I don't see why e.g. creating ctabfolder with toolbar and playing with colors in this toolbar 
Dec 01 09:09:26 <akurtakov>	needs to be platform specific
Dec 01 09:09:36 <akurtakov>	what content ?
Dec 01 09:09:59 <ericwill>	so I think the issue here lies that the GTK CSS applied to the widget doesn't always equal what SWT returns
Dec 01 09:10:16 <ericwill>	getting access to the CSS would help parse "actual" colors vs. what the SWT API reports
Dec 01 09:10:47 <ericwill>	and it wouldn't be hard to have getData just spit out the contents of the GTK CSS
Dec 01 09:11:01 <akurtakov>	that would be fine with me
Dec 01 09:11:10 <akurtakov>	as long as you keep it under some internal key
Dec 01 09:11:34 <ericwill>	okay
Dec 01 09:16:13 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I would like ot see this coloring issue fixed before going back to a11y
Dec 01 09:17:08 <ericwill>	akurtakov agreed, now it's just straight up annoying me :)
Dec 01 09:22:36 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: how confident are you in your browserfunction changes?
Dec 01 09:46:56 <ericwill>	akurtakov so the regression with the toolbars in the formeditor were there with the original patch as well
Dec 01 09:46:59 *	ericwill sighs
Dec 01 09:47:04 <ericwill>	back to the drawing board
Dec 01 10:16:46 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I don't remember
Dec 01 10:28:09 <akurtakov>	ericwill: so do you have an idea what's going on ?
Dec 01 10:28:28 <akurtakov>	what troubles me is it changes colors on changing tabs
Dec 01 10:29:05 <ericwill>	akurtakov not concretely
Dec 01 10:29:12 <ericwill>	and yes that makes it more confusing for me as well
Dec 01 10:29:36 <ericwill>	but that doesn't happen when theming is disabled
Dec 01 10:30:05 <ericwill>	I'm also curious how this theming even happens, does it set the bg color for every widget? or is there some inheritance scheme going on
Dec 01 10:34:07 <ericwill>	I also think this all stems from setBackgroundMode being broken
Dec 01 10:34:16 <ericwill>	and now that we have transparent colors it's more of an issue than before
Dec 01 10:39:59 <akurtakov>	ericwill: probably,you're right
Dec 01 10:40:21 <akurtakov>	regarding theming it is quite dummy and not effective
Dec 01 10:40:30 <akurtakov>	it blindly sets the color always
Dec 01 10:41:47 <ericwill>	I am not a big fan of these themes
Dec 01 10:41:49 <ericwill>	they cause headaches
Dec 01 10:42:11 <ericwill>	at least on GTK, can't speak for Win32 or cocoa
Dec 01 10:48:10 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I'm not a fan of them either
Dec 01 10:48:30 <akurtakov>	but this doesnt' change the fact we dont' have the manpower to introduce proper theming at swt level
Dec 01 10:48:40 <akurtakov>	and it's really wanted feature
Dec 01 10:48:44 <akurtakov>	so we have to live with it
Dec 01 10:49:24 <ericwill>	what would be the option for proper theming
Dec 01 10:49:31 <ericwill>	write a GTK theme to ship with SWT?
Dec 01 10:49:40 <ericwill>	or more API
Dec 01 11:11:22 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hey
Dec 01 11:12:03 <akurtakov>	well, IMHO the setStyle(String css)
Dec 01 11:12:16 <akurtakov>	which is a real one and consults parent for keys missing :)
Dec 01 11:12:25 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, at this moment I don't know of anything that would make the browserfunction more stable, we just have to merge and see what happens. I haven't found any issues with it, seems to work well, feels good.
Dec 01 11:13:06 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I ment giving access to Lucas so he can test how the GTK theme works under windows and vice-versa
Dec 01 11:13:41 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, how does giving lucas access to one of the eclipse test machines relate to browserfunction?
Dec 01 11:13:52 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: it doesnt'
Dec 01 11:13:57 <lufimtse>	lufimtse, ok, 
Dec 01 11:14:11 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the laptop is idle on my desk, can be taken at any time.
Dec 01 11:14:20 <lufimtse>	or remoted into via vnc
Dec 01 11:16:08 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: when I asked about confident I ment in terms of build scripts
Dec 01 11:25:34 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: so do you want to commit it now ? the build system should pick it up proper, right?
Dec 01 11:27:24 <ericwill>	this business of shipping other OS themes is cool
Dec 01 11:30:25 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so build servers are ready?
Dec 01 11:30:38 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I need to submit binary repo patch first,
Dec 01 11:30:40 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: should be
Dec 01 11:30:53 <lufimtse>	does it take a while for swt repo to pickup on changes in binary repo?
Dec 01 11:31:35 <akurtakov>	it doesn't pick them
Dec 01 11:31:43 <akurtakov>	I don't know what you mean by that actually?
Dec 01 11:31:51 <lufimtse>	sec
Dec 01 11:33:31 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/112215/
Dec 01 11:33:38 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, has to be merged first
Dec 01 11:34:03 <lufimtse>	then so that when maven builds, it reads the webextension folder
Dec 01 11:34:21 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the only thing about the browserfunction patch is that I haven't tested on 32bit.
Dec 01 11:34:51 <akurtakov>	so you have to push the 2 patches at the same time?
Dec 01 11:36:35 <lufimtse>	I guess? the binary patch doesn't depend on the browserFunction patch, but the BrowserFunction patch depends on the binary repo patch.
Dec 01 11:39:09 <lufimtse>	Ok, so I guess I should merge in the binary patch then.
Dec 01 11:39:15 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Dec 01 11:39:36 <akurtakov>	ok, so merge them both
Dec 01 11:39:40 <lufimtse>	kk
Dec 01 11:41:15 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, as heads up/fyi. it's possible that browserFunction may not work on linuxs390*, ppc, arm,hpux,aix.  ~I'll start merging.
Dec 01 11:41:43 <akurtakov>	as long as it doesn't break builds I'm fine with that :)
Dec 01 11:42:20 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok. Hmm, maybe I should prevent webkit being build on anything non-linuxx86_64 related?
Dec 01 11:42:26 <lufimtse>	i mean the extension
Dec 01 11:42:35 <akurtakov>	no, please don't bother with it
Dec 01 11:42:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, linux_x86_*
Dec 01 11:42:51 <lufimtse>	it might break aix/s390 builds
Dec 01 11:42:59 <akurtakov>	if it fails them we will remove them
Dec 01 11:43:04 <lufimtse>	ok.
Dec 01 11:43:14 <lufimtse>	should I send something out on mailing list about the patch?
Dec 01 11:43:37 <akurtakov>	it shouldn't break x86, x86_64, ppc64 and ppc64le
Dec 01 11:43:55 <akurtakov>	all 4 machines should have webkitgkt4 -devel installed
Dec 01 11:44:03 <lufimtse>	ok, then should work.
Dec 01 11:44:41 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: btw, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/112215/ doesn't include ppc
Dec 01 11:45:13 <akurtakov>	ericwill: so no color fix for M4 it is ?
Dec 01 11:45:20 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, good point. I guess I could add to ppc. should I also add to other gtk platforms?
Dec 01 11:45:35 <akurtakov>	no just these 4
Dec 01 11:45:39 <lufimtse>	ok
Dec 01 11:45:56 <ericwill>	akurtakov no fix for M4. I want to fix the setBackgroundMode issue first
Dec 01 11:46:06 <ericwill>	otherwise it is just a mess of bandaid fixes
Dec 01 11:46:09 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, do you know what is ppc64le?
Dec 01 11:46:15 <lufimtse>	le*
Dec 01 11:46:22 <ericwill>	but I am making these color issues the highest priority for M5
Dec 01 11:46:23 <akurtakov>	little endian
Dec 01 11:46:35 *	akurtakov is the one that maintains the build machine :)
Dec 01 11:46:55 <akurtakov>	https://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?planurl=/eclipse/development/plans/eclipse_project_plan_4_8.xml#target_environments
Dec 01 11:47:16 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: it's the only other non x86 platform
Dec 01 11:49:36 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah
Dec 01 11:52:07 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/112722/ ?
Dec 01 11:53:09 <akurtakov>	looks good
Dec 01 11:58:12 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: fyi, certainly possible to do it in pure java libs https://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-send-http-request-getpost-in-java/ .  i don't mind having a look later today, unless you're already working on it.
Dec 01 11:58:32 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, hey
Dec 01 11:58:39 *	lufimtse reading myyong
Dec 01 12:00:09 <rgrunber>	URL has openConnection which gives an HTTPURLConnection. from there you can set the method, attributes, and get an outputstream to write the payload directly.
Dec 01 12:00:27 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, can we make webkit think that the webpage url changed?
Dec 01 12:00:49 <lufimtse>	like, not just set the text, but suppose the js on the page want's to know which url/domain it's on, will git get the new domain?
Dec 01 12:01:46 <rgrunber>	could we do a setURL that just does a GET the first time, and then go through java api and setText the second time ?
Dec 01 12:02:11 <rgrunber>	ah i c what you mean.. 
Dec 01 12:02:34 <rgrunber>	can't delay executing the js, might look different by the time we get the data..
Dec 01 12:02:56 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, hmm. 
Dec 01 12:03:04 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, like:   alert( "The full URL of this page is:<br>" + window.location.href)
Dec 01 12:03:13 <lufimtse>	should return url of post request url
Dec 01 12:03:15 <lufimtse>	not the old one.
Dec 01 12:03:47 <rgrunber>	they'd be the same.. the url of the post request is the same as if we just did a get.. post just specifies what data we send to that url.
Dec 01 12:07:07 <lufimtse>	I mean once we got something in java, how do we set webkit to that data such that the webpageURL is also set properly?
Dec 01 12:08:48 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, as a sidenote, the javascript/form hack doesn't deal with headers. So we'd either be able to set url with custom headers or url with postdata, but not both.
Dec 01 12:08:52 <rgrunber>	by calling setURL with no post data the first time , the url would be correct.
Dec 01 12:09:25 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, so call url, then call url with postdata and set page data with the result we got from java?
Dec 01 12:09:56 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, I wonder if we can set the url, but then stop loading via signal, then set the page data
Dec 01 12:10:02 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Dec 01 12:10:10 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, that could prevent double load.
Dec 01 12:10:31 <lufimtse>	brb.
Dec 01 12:11:12 <rgrunber>	another possibility is in setText() itself of browser. it calls webkit_web_view_load_html. that function takes a base_uri as the last argument, because the render the html it might have to resolve things like images, relative to the base uri, so it does some additional GET requests.. i wonder if webkit might handle setting the url to base_uri..
Dec 01 12:12:24 <rgrunber>	currently we only pass in about:blank, or file:/// for setText().. but we could add some special field there, that if set, passes the actual base_uri from setURL..
Dec 01 12:21:03 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: what did the webkit dev said about it ?
Dec 01 12:22:06 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: haven't proposed this to him at that time, he just mentioned he'd speak to webkit devs about a possible solution and get back to us.
Dec 01 12:22:26 <akurtakov>	ok
Dec 01 12:22:34 <akurtakov>	did you point him to sami's bz?
Dec 01 12:23:14 <rgrunber>	we were looking at ways outside of webkit api. yes pointed him to it.
Dec 01 12:43:41 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, maybe we should make it clear that we need to be able to do post+headers, not necesserily access to soupmessage
Dec 01 12:43:57 <lufimtse>	that seems like more reasonable api than requesting soupmessage access
Dec 01 12:44:38 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, webkit_web_view_load_html(..) seems promising..
Dec 01 12:44:51 <lufimtse>	maybe do the java thing and then use webkit_web_view_load_html(..)
Dec 01 12:47:08 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, do you think you can wip together a prototype that uses java + webkit_web_view_load_html(..), test with the bugzilla query from snippet330?
Dec 01 12:47:11 <rgrunber>	yeah i'll send a clarifying email.. since even the bug mentioned being able to possible append to the data
Dec 01 12:47:32 <lufimtse>	maybe even clarify in the bug that we just need setUrl/postData/headers
Dec 01 12:47:35 <lufimtse>	at least.
Dec 01 12:48:44 <rgrunber>	yeah, and i at least wanna try out putting a wip together.. from just thinking about it, it "should work", but i won't know what other issues may come up unless i try it.
Dec 01 12:48:53 <lufimtse>	he he 
Dec 01 12:49:00 <lufimtse>	ok. back in 15 min.
Dec 01 13:50:14 <ericwill>	lufimtse just saw you are merging a ~2200 line change on the Friday before M4
Dec 01 13:50:17 <ericwill>	may god be with you
Dec 01 13:50:34 <lufimtse>	ericwill, ^__^
Dec 01 13:51:21 <lufimtse>	 /s/god/God/ :P
Dec 01 13:51:42 <ericwill>	:)
Dec 01 14:48:42 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, any joy with the setUrl business?
Dec 01 14:49:24 <rgrunber>	it works.. about to see if passing the baseurl to the webkit_web_view_load_html also resolves other images...
Dec 01 14:49:30 <rgrunber>	*partially works
Dec 01 14:51:04 <rgrunber>	woohoo!
Dec 01 14:51:36 <rgrunber>	yup looks good.. i'll post a basic WIP of it ..
Dec 01 14:51:49 <lufimtse>	weee
Dec 01 14:51:52 <lufimtse>	keeewwll
Dec 01 14:53:14 <rgrunber>	only one dirty hack (on top of the fact that we're bypassing webkit api).. and that's adding the field 'url' kind of like we have headers and postData.. because setText has no way to pass in the base url.
Dec 01 14:53:40 <rgrunber>	just have to set it to null when we're done with it, like is done for postData/headers..
Dec 01 14:54:13 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, I see
Dec 01 14:54:42 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, might be sensible to use the java hackaround only if postData is not null. Use current meachanism for when it is null.
Dec 01 14:55:09 <lufimtse>	to minimize potential side effects I guess
Dec 01 14:55:17 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: :) this hack only activates when postData is not null.. otherwise old behaviour is honoured
Dec 01 14:55:25 <lufimtse>	kk
Dec 01 14:55:34 <rgrunber>	i thought the same thing.. risky to change the code flow in any other case.
Dec 01 15:05:56 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, btw, I would suggest to pull master and work on top of the browserFunction patch. It's quite extensible, just to avoid merge conflicts.
Dec 01 15:06:21 <rgrunber>	yeah, already on top of it. i'm seeing print messages to console about it..
Dec 01 15:06:24 <lufimtse>	.. s/extensible/changes a lot of code/
Dec 01 15:06:35 <rgrunber>	SWT_LIB_Gtk:3.22.26
Dec 01 15:06:35 <rgrunber>	SWT_LIB  Webkit2   Webkitgtk:2.18.3  (webkitgtk >=2.5 is Webkit2)

Dec 01 15:06:35 <rgrunber>	   not finished: setUrl(..postData)
Dec 01 15:06:43 <lufimtse>	ah yea.
Dec 01 15:06:44 <lufimtse>	he he
Dec 01 15:06:59 <lufimtse>	We can update the setUrl bit.
Dec 01 15:07:25 <lufimtse>	Just want to get info from people who will be using the webkitport, to know which version they're on.
**** BEGIN LOGGING AT Mon Dec  4 09:27:16 2017

Dec 04 09:27:16 *	Now talking on #SWT
Dec 04 13:38:21 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, about webkit extension
Dec 04 13:38:43 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, (maybe I'm missing something also, so let me explain)
Dec 04 13:39:08 <lufimtse>	for webkit to load extension, there must only be a single .so in the webextensions folder
Dec 04 13:39:26 <lufimtse>	e.g libswt-webkit...-48...so
Dec 04 13:39:35 <lufimtse>	if there are two different versions, then it'll try to load both as extensions
Dec 04 13:39:56 <lufimtse>	if the folder doesn't have a version, then when we rebuild locally, there will be the old extension in that folder and a new one.
Dec 04 13:40:01 <lufimtse>	so local development breaks
Dec 04 13:40:27 <akurtakov>	ok, that's easily fixable
Dec 04 13:40:41 <akurtakov>	we can chaange build.sh to wipe out on install
Dec 04 13:40:41 <lufimtse>	if the extracted folder name is the same, then next time you update eclipse, you'll have two libswt-webkitextension.so files
Dec 04 13:41:08 <akurtakov>	hmm, why would I have two files
Dec 04 13:41:23 <akurtakov>	this happens in osgi.config.area
Dec 04 13:41:28 <lufimtse>	suppose you have swt 4801, then you update and have swt 4802
Dec 04 13:41:31 <akurtakov>	and old content will be wiped out
Dec 04 13:41:36 <lufimtse>	then the ~/.swt/.. contains both .so files.
Dec 04 13:41:50 <lufimtse>	problem is when you update eclipse...
Dec 04 13:41:57 <akurtakov>	ah, so this is for standalone swt not for eclipse usage
Dec 04 13:42:11 <lufimtse>	well, the eclipse usage extracts the .so's also.
Dec 04 13:42:14 <lufimtse>	to ~/.swt
Dec 04 13:42:14 <akurtakov>	eclipse is not extracting anything in .swt
Dec 04 13:42:36 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, now it is :-)
Dec 04 13:42:54 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, webkit2 must have a folder with .so in it.
Dec 04 13:43:22 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, unfortunatley webkit2 cannot load a file on it's own, the only api given is to specify a directory.
Dec 04 13:43:23 <akurtakov>	why not doing same as other so file
Dec 04 13:43:30 <lufimtse>	as per above
Dec 04 13:43:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, webkit2 api is not great :-/
Dec 04 13:44:13 <akurtakov>	all so files go into install_dir/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi/${bundle_id}/.cp....
Dec 04 13:44:24 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Dec 04 13:44:26 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, basically
Dec 04 13:44:59 <akurtakov>	did you manually specify .swt somewhere
Dec 04 13:45:09 <lufimtse>	 /home/lufimtse/.swt/lib/linux/x86_64/webkitextensions  <<
Dec 04 13:45:15 <lufimtse>	the .swt is put into your home folder.
Dec 04 13:45:18 <akurtakov>	let's make an experiment
Dec 04 13:45:27 <akurtakov>	rm -fr ~/.swt
Dec 04 13:45:32 <akurtakov>	stop eclipse
Dec 04 13:45:34 <akurtakov>	start it again
Dec 04 13:45:37 <akurtakov>	look for ~/.swt
Dec 04 13:45:49 <lufimtse>	yea, did that, it basically
Dec 04 13:46:05 <lufimtse>	creates .swt/lib/linux/.../webextensions/libswt-web...ext..so
Dec 04 13:46:14 <lufimtse>	~/.swt/..
Dec 04 13:46:41 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so basically for browserFunction to work, it must have a temp folder on the system.
Dec 04 13:46:52 <lufimtse>	with the extension inside it.
Dec 04 13:46:55 <akurtakov>	and no other swt.so file ?
Dec 04 13:47:17 <akurtakov>	where do you think the other swt.so files are
Dec 04 13:47:27 <akurtakov>	go in your install_dir/configuration 
Dec 04 13:47:32 <lufimtse>	for eclipse, yes, only webextension. For standalone .swt, it extracts 3 more (--pi3-...so  etc..)
Dec 04 13:47:33 <akurtakov>	and search for *.so file
Dec 04 13:47:41 <akurtakov>	when you run eclipse
Dec 04 13:47:45 <lufimtse>	sec
Dec 04 13:48:00 <akurtakov>	the webextension should be together with all other *.so files
Dec 04 13:48:06 <akurtakov>	once this is fixed
Dec 04 13:48:23 <akurtakov>	this leaves the issue with standalone swt yes
Dec 04 13:49:11 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, yes, to confirm. With an eclipse, only the webkitextensions .. so is extracted. the other libs are picked up by OSGI mechanism s
Dec 04 13:49:12 <lufimtse>	.swt
Dec 04 13:49:12 <lufimtse>	└── lib
Dec 04 13:49:12 <lufimtse>	    └── linux
Dec 04 13:49:12 <lufimtse>		└── x86_64
Dec 04 13:49:12 <lufimtse>	            └── webkitextensions
Dec 04 13:49:12 <lufimtse>	                └── libswt-webkit2extension-gtk-4840.so
Dec 04 13:49:41 <lufimtse>	by standalone swt all other .so's are extracted also.
Dec 04 13:49:45 <lufimtse>	into x86_64
Dec 04 13:49:50 <akurtakov>	how did you specify this folder btw?
Dec 04 13:49:56 <akurtakov>	it should even go in x86_64
Dec 04 13:50:34 <lufimtse>	the folder name is generated in Library.java
Dec 04 13:50:42 <lufimtse>	USER_HOME + SWT_LIB_DIR
Dec 04 13:50:55 <lufimtse>	where SWT_LIB_DIR is .swt + lib + os() + arch()
Dec 04 13:51:09 <lufimtse>	it is then created in Library.java
Dec 04 13:51:33 <lufimtse>	ok, so there are 2 fixes possible:
Dec 04 13:51:50 <lufimtse>	1) Append version to webkitextensions folder 
Dec 04 13:52:13 <lufimtse>	2) package webkitextension in the same way as other .so, but extact it into a folder with version prefix
Dec 04 13:52:41 <lufimtse>	for 1), this would require the build scripts to be able to include webkitextensions*  < with asteric
Dec 04 13:53:21 <akurtakov>	now, let me start with issue when running from inside eclipse
Dec 04 13:53:32 <akurtakov>	it should not use ~/.swt
Dec 04 13:53:38 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, not possible :-/
Dec 04 13:53:42 <akurtakov>	in your install folder
Dec 04 13:53:49 <akurtakov>	cd configuration
Dec 04 13:53:53 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah,
Dec 04 13:53:56 <akurtakov>	find -name *.so
Dec 04 13:54:06 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so extract it into your install folder instead?
Dec 04 13:54:11 <akurtakov>	./configuration/org.eclipse.osgi/2597/0/.cp/libswt-webkit-gtk-4840.so
Dec 04 13:54:22 <akurtakov>	how do you think this ends up there ?
Dec 04 13:55:09 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah I see. HMmm, no idea, have to investigate
Dec 04 13:55:16 <lufimtse>	give me 15 mins.
Dec 04 13:55:38 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so basically you want me to extract into install ~/.configuration/..../webkitextension/ folder
Dec 04 13:55:49 <akurtakov>	yes
Dec 04 13:55:54 <akurtakov>	but it's not extract at runtime
Dec 04 13:55:57 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, this could work, even without folder version
Dec 04 13:56:04 <akurtakov>	it's done at publishing
Dec 04 13:56:12 <lufimtse>	at publishing?
Dec 04 13:56:37 <akurtakov>	this is done by osgi environment 
Dec 04 13:56:43 <akurtakov>	let me find you a reference for it
Dec 04 13:58:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, from what I gather, that ./configuration/org...osgi/.. stuff is extracted at run time.
Dec 04 13:59:34 <akurtakov>	yes
Dec 04 14:00:00 <akurtakov>	but this is not smth swt does at startup
Dec 04 14:00:09 <akurtakov>	it is smth the osgi env does on bundle load
Dec 04 14:00:18 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, do you know, do I specify these libswt-webkit-gtk-XXX in swt project, or somewhere in some pom.xml of sorts?
Dec 04 14:00:33 <lufimtse>	like would the fix be in swt project for this or would I have to hunt somewhere else...
Dec 04 14:00:49 <akurtakov>	it would be elsewhere
Dec 04 14:00:53 <lufimtse>	from what I can see, the osgi mechanism does support folders
Dec 04 14:00:54 <akurtakov>	in equinox most probably
Dec 04 14:01:22 <lufimtse>	e.g some has /.cp/icons/obj16/file.ext
Dec 04 14:01:35 <lufimtse>	so it could be done for webkitextensions theoretically
Dec 04 14:01:57 <akurtakov>	please verify/push the other patches while I find you entry point
Dec 04 14:02:02 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Sami's patch did include a bit on the osgi thing.
Dec 04 14:02:31 <akurtakov>	pointer ?
Dec 04 14:02:35 <lufimtse>	sec
Dec 04 14:04:16 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/25157/13/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT+PI/common_j2se/org/eclipse/swt/internal/Library.java 
Dec 04 14:04:19 <lufimtse>	see line 370
Dec 04 14:04:48 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the only thing is that that code doesn't put the extension into it's own folder.
Dec 04 14:05:20 <lufimtse>	it's hard for me to test the code as it requires a rebuild of eclipse, but given enough rebuilds I could make it work that way
Dec 04 14:09:06 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok, from what I gather, we need to do the following:
Dec 04 14:09:28 <lufimtse>	1) WebkitextensionsXXX  should have a version number at the end so that local development doesn't break.
Dec 04 14:09:45 <lufimtse>	2) I should implement code so that local .swt/ extracts into a versioned folder
Dec 04 14:10:09 <lufimtse>	3) I should investigate how to extract this with OSGI 
Dec 04 14:10:34 <akurtakov>	only for 1) it should keep the same format as we ship
Dec 04 14:10:53 <akurtakov>	thus it should stay webkitextensions but install should wipe previous files in the dir
Dec 04 14:11:25 <akurtakov>	btw, what exactly happens when having multiple *so files ? does it crash ?
Dec 04 14:11:51 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, have not tried, but I extect pretty bad things.
Dec 04 14:12:15 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, both extensions will be loaded and there will be conflicts
Dec 04 14:12:38 <akurtakov>	the issue with folder is wiping out/creating dir on every rebuild
Dec 04 14:12:53 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the wiping thing is not done for other .so files
Dec 04 14:13:00 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, it could be done...
Dec 04 14:13:22 <akurtakov>	it's not done as it knows what to load
Dec 04 14:13:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, another solution is to package the webkitextension.so just like all the other .so files, and simply extract into a versioned folder 
Dec 04 14:13:54 <akurtakov>	btw, do you have bug opened for webkit to load so file instead of dir ?
Dec 04 14:14:01 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmm, although that would break local development a bit...
Dec 04 14:14:18 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, let me check
Dec 04 14:15:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, no, I think I spoke with WebkitGtk folks on IRC, they pointed out that it can only be done via the directory and that was the end of it. I could submit a request thou?
Dec 04 14:15:47 <akurtakov>	yes please
Dec 04 14:16:17 <lufimtse>	ok. That would be a potential improvement in the future. For the time being we need to figure out the versioning business
Dec 04 14:16:27 <lufimtse>	do you wanna bluejeans?
Dec 04 14:16:35 <akurtakov>	no
Dec 04 14:16:38 <akurtakov>	too late
Dec 04 14:16:41 <lufimtse>	ok.
Dec 04 14:16:42 <lufimtse>	hmm
Dec 04 14:16:47 <akurtakov>	kids in bed already :)
Dec 04 14:17:05 <akurtakov>	so better keep quiet for sometime :)
Dec 04 14:17:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, we need to figure out if 1) delete old webkitextensions/webkitextesion.so files or 2) create webkitextensionsXXXX/web..so 
Dec 04 14:18:09 <lufimtse>	1) is not done for any other .so file from what I gather
Dec 04 14:18:17 <lufimtse>	so it would be a new mechanism of sorts
Dec 04 14:18:41 <akurtakov>	well, get ti that way
Dec 04 14:18:49 <lufimtse>	could be done, although a bit out of sync with other code.
Dec 04 14:18:52 <lufimtse>	2)  << 
Dec 04 14:18:53 <akurtakov>	if we have webkitextensionsXXx
Dec 04 14:19:06 <akurtakov>	this would pile in the dir
Dec 04 14:19:19 <lufimtse>	2) from what I gather , all files are created for a maven build from scratch anyway, including the versioned folder?
Dec 04 14:19:37 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, why do you think it would pile up?
Dec 04 14:19:57 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, does the current code remove the *.so files or is the whole folder re-created each time?
Dec 04 14:20:18 <lufimtse>	I get the sense that it just wipes and re-creates the whole thing
Dec 04 14:20:20 <akurtakov>	remove the so files
Dec 04 14:20:27 <lufimtse>	so then it wouldn't pile up version numbers
Dec 04 14:20:37 <akurtakov>	http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.binaries.git/commit/?id=4d32c3babe08510fac3ec82c0e569f0599cf7bc1
Dec 04 14:20:37 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah, so it removes the .so files?
Dec 04 14:20:50 <akurtakov>	webkitextensions dir is there
Dec 04 14:21:28 <akurtakov>	this would mean tweaking all the build machines, piling up stuff from local builds, unclear git history and so on
Dec 04 14:22:17 <akurtakov>	so let's go for 1) wipe out *.so from webextensions on install
Dec 04 14:22:26 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so implement 1), which would delete old webextension.so files before copying new one?
Dec 04 14:22:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok, I can do that.
Dec 04 14:22:50 <akurtakov>	2) extract versioned in ~/.swt
Dec 04 14:23:06 <akurtakov>	doh, that would not work
Dec 04 14:23:13 <akurtakov>	sigh
Dec 04 14:23:14 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok, so I can do as following: 1) wipe .so files.  2) Implement so that locally .swt/ extracted into versioned folder.   3) (if I can get it done in time) implement the osgi load mechanismo
Dec 04 14:23:48 *	akurtakov doesn't want to deal with crappy build configs again
Dec 04 14:23:49 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I can extract into versioned webkitextension folder even if the .jar doesn't have versioned folder name.
Dec 04 14:24:06 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I think I can get it done without messing with build server config files.
Dec 04 14:24:15 <lufimtse>	 *probably
Dec 04 14:24:23 <akurtakov>	well, the issue is what happens with osgi load 
Dec 04 14:24:42 <lufimtse>	osgi loads don't care about versioning. I think?
Dec 04 14:24:49 <lufimtse>	hmm
Dec 04 14:24:49 <akurtakov>	as osgi load will probably have to have the same structure as the local
Dec 04 14:25:12 <akurtakov>	thus if it's versioned in one place will have to be in the other for the loadLibrary call to work
Dec 04 14:25:47 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmm, 
Dec 04 14:26:32 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I don't quite know osgi well enough. What happens after you update eclipse to newer version. Would the ./configuration/ ... have multiple sets of .so files in the same folder or different folders?
Dec 04 14:26:51 <akurtakov>	different folder
Dec 04 14:26:56 <akurtakov>	it's the bundleid
Dec 04 14:27:03 <akurtakov>	as in integer
Dec 04 14:27:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what is the bundleID?
Dec 04 14:27:29 <akurtakov>	every bundle in the runtime has an integer identifier
Dec 04 14:27:34 <akurtakov>	and on swt update
Dec 04 14:27:41 <akurtakov>	the old one is removed and new one created
Dec 04 14:27:56 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah, so that explains why I only have one set of .so files in my eclipse ./configuration
Dec 04 14:28:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, in that case, we can get away without versioned folder in osgi
Dec 04 14:28:26 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the versioned folder in that case is only needed for local .swt/...
Dec 04 14:28:36 <akurtakov>	yes and it explains why I didn't understand your concern as we can never have duplicated if properly done
Dec 04 14:28:52 <akurtakov>	but the trick is in the loadLibrary call
Dec 04 14:29:01 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, yes, that makes sense. I need to read an osgi book :-).
Dec 04 14:29:05 <akurtakov>	it has to know the dir from which to load
Dec 04 14:29:20 <akurtakov>	and whether versioned or not matters in this case
Dec 04 14:29:21 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, well
Dec 04 14:29:35 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I need it to put it into a folder and give me File in return
Dec 04 14:29:39 <akurtakov>	as I don't want to see this ifed
Dec 04 14:29:41 <lufimtse>	I can then get parent of file
Dec 04 14:29:56 <lufimtse>	File.getParent()
Dec 04 14:30:19 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, this seems possible. other files in ./configuration/ seem to be inside folders.
Dec 04 14:31:03 <lufimtse>	eg
Dec 04 14:31:10 <lufimtse>	./2852/0/.cp/icons/wizban/import_wiz.png
Dec 04 14:31:10 <lufimtse>	./2852/0/.cp/icons/etool16
Dec 04 14:31:10 <lufimtse>	./2852/0/.cp/icons/etool16/createRepository.png
Dec 04 14:31:19 <lufimtse>	wizban, etool16
Dec 04 14:31:30 <lufimtse>	so just need to figure out how to put stuff into a particular folder.
Dec 04 14:31:58 <akurtakov>	no, this should not happen from swt
Dec 04 14:32:02 <akurtakov>	for swt it shouldn't matter
Dec 04 14:32:03 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I suggest that perhaps I'll first work on 1 and 2, and then look into the osgi business. That way we'd have something working for M4.
Dec 04 14:32:07 <akurtakov>	whether osgi or not
Dec 04 14:32:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I see
Dec 04 14:32:19 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Dec 04 14:32:23 <akurtakov>	but what we chose for 1) and 2)
Dec 04 14:32:31 <akurtakov>	depend on 3)
Dec 04 14:32:56 <akurtakov>	so if you go versioned dir
Dec 04 14:33:12 <akurtakov>	1 and 2 should be doable and it should not be an issue for 3)
Dec 04 14:34:01 <akurtakov>	and this would involve another tweak of the build machines
Dec 04 14:34:03 <akurtakov>	sigh
Dec 04 14:34:26 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmm
Dec 04 14:34:50 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, how does osgi figure out which file to extract? does it override loadLib of sorts?
Dec 04 14:34:54 <lufimtse>	loadLibrary
Dec 04 14:34:57 <lufimtse>	or does it use URL?
Dec 04 14:35:10 <lufimtse>	I'm looking at Library.loadLibrary()
Dec 04 14:35:15 <lufimtse>	where does it interact with osgi
Dec 04 14:35:26 <akurtakov>	so go versioned
Dec 04 14:35:51 <akurtakov>	I'll have to tweak the build servers
Dec 04 14:36:27 <akurtakov>	go versioned
Dec 04 14:36:42 <akurtakov>	it has issues but at least it won't break with osgi
Dec 04 14:36:45 <akurtakov>	sigh
Dec 04 14:37:55 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmm
Dec 04 14:40:50 <akurtakov>	please make sure to not break the build with the changes though :)
Dec 04 14:47:00 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so if I understand corretly, I should  1) update the build.properties  s/webkitextensions/webkitextensions*     2) Update SWT WebKit.java to look for a versioned folder.
Dec 04 14:47:19 <lufimtse>	Are there build server changes that have to be done to facilitate the versioned thing?
Dec 04 14:47:26 <akurtakov>	1) remove webextensions dir too
Dec 04 14:47:35 <lufimtse>	and remove dir in build.sh
Dec 04 14:47:52 <lufimtse>	assuming those will be done, will you have to do some modifications to build servers?
Dec 04 14:48:13 <akurtakov>	not sure about the build server 
Dec 04 14:48:20 <akurtakov>	sigh, I hate that part
Dec 04 14:48:28 <akurtakov>	please do 1) and 2)
Dec 04 14:48:34 <akurtakov>	if it breaks it will break
Dec 04 14:49:00 <akurtakov>	I just remember latest build was using IBM machines
Dec 04 14:49:07 <akurtakov>	so I even can't fix anything there
Dec 04 14:49:07 <lufimtse>	From my testing, with 1), maven builds the .jar with /webkitextensionXXX/lib...so inside it. 
Dec 04 14:49:30 <lufimtse>	i.e, the build.properties does include it.
Dec 04 14:50:25 <lufimtse>	ok, I'll go for it and see what happens.
Dec 04 14:50:55 <lufimtse>	it must be pretty late for you. Should I just merge stuff when ready or set for review and let you inspect first?
Dec 04 15:00:57 <akurtakov>	just merge
Dec 04 15:01:09 <akurtakov>	and merge the other patches too
Dec 04 15:01:30 <akurtakov>	I don't want to see them on Wed build :)

Dec 06 10:57:27 <ericwill>	or something else
Dec 06 10:57:33 <ericwill>	(I am not familiar with jira)
Dec 06 10:57:51 <akurtakov>	ericwill: move them to the Done column
Dec 06 10:58:38 <ericwill>	okay
Dec 06 10:59:25 <akurtakov>	ericwill: and these that you work on, to in progress column
Dec 06 10:59:33 <ericwill>	akurtakov got it :)
Dec 06 11:25:26 <akurtakov>	ericwill: 886 SWT/GTK open bugs 
Dec 06 11:25:32 <akurtakov>	new record low :)
Dec 06 11:26:04 <ericwill>	akurtakov nice :) maybe this year we can get it under 500
Dec 06 11:26:17 <akurtakov>	hmm in the next 24 days ? :)
Dec 06 11:27:19 <ericwill>	I meant next year :P
Dec 06 11:27:23 <akurtakov>	i plan nice christmas vacation but if you volunteer :)
Dec 06 11:28:26 <akurtakov>	if we kill gtk2 it's doable :)
Dec 06 11:32:23 <ericwill>	fingers crossed
Dec 06 12:36:49 <ericwill>	akurtakov more info on setBackgroundMode stuff: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=519416#c7
Dec 06 13:10:23 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hmm, I can't help much with that :)
Dec 06 13:10:31 <akurtakov>	it will be try and error again
Dec 06 13:10:44 <akurtakov>	but it would be nice if we document/test more for the next round 
Dec 06 13:10:47 <akurtakov>	aka gtk4 :)
Dec 06 13:11:13 <ericwill>	yes, I am in uncharted territory :) will do
Dec 06 13:11:43 <akurtakov>	ericwill: at the time this was done there was no transparency to start with :)
Dec 06 13:12:03 <ericwill>	akurtakov I can see that haha
Dec 06 13:12:07 <ericwill>	this has been broken for awhile
Dec 06 13:12:17 <ericwill>	sadly
Dec 06 13:18:44 <akurtakov>	880 - donefor today :)
Dec 06 13:20:29 <akurtakov>	ericwill: while looking at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=269289
Dec 06 13:20:56 <akurtakov>	if you get group to inherit proper that would fix many(most?) instances due to how eclipse UI is contructed
Dec 06 13:22:33 <ericwill>	akurtakov the blue background is set on group
Dec 06 13:22:49 <ericwill>	fixing it makes it worse as now all its children that are broken are inheriting it :)
Dec 06 13:23:09 <ericwill>	that screenshot is old, let me show you what it looks like now
Dec 06 13:23:31 <akurtakov>	ok, I was going to say "so group doesn't set background proper?"
Dec 06 13:25:25 <ericwill>	akurtakov this is what it looks like now: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=271800
Dec 06 13:25:50 <akurtakov>	aka no diff :)
Dec 06 13:26:08 <ericwill>	yup
Dec 06 13:26:22 <ericwill>	I will keep at it
Dec 06 13:26:25 <ericwill>	I have some ideas
Dec 06 13:26:28 <akurtakov>	ok, this stuff is tiresome :)
Dec 06 13:26:46 <ericwill>	very...

Dec 11 09:29:53 *	Now talking on #SWT
Dec 11 10:26:50 <akurtakov>	lufimtse, ericwill: here?
Dec 11 10:27:06 <ericwill>	akurtakov hello
Dec 11 10:27:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, yes.
Dec 11 10:35:25 <akurtakov>	so what do you guys think of the openFile crash?
Dec 11 10:35:40 <akurtakov>	is the approach viable in your opinion?
Dec 11 10:38:29 <ericwill>	akurtakov haven't looked into it yet
Dec 11 10:38:47 <akurtakov>	when are your vacations guys?
Dec 11 10:39:18 <ericwill>	I am off from the 25th - 2nd
Dec 11 10:39:25 <ericwill>	might take the 21st or the 22nd off
Dec 11 10:41:57 <akurtakov>	this Friday is last for me for this year
Dec 11 10:42:09 <akurtakov>	so if I haven't provided a fix for the crash
Dec 11 10:42:28 <akurtakov>	I would ask you to look into it next week
Dec 11 10:42:37 <ericwill>	sounds good to me
Dec 11 10:42:48 <akurtakov>	my approach could be plain stupid but that's what I managed to come up with so far
Dec 11 10:44:22 <ericwill>	I will look into it this afternoon
Dec 11 11:16:18 *	Disconnected (Connection timed out)

Dec 11 12:01:25 *	Now talking on #SWT
Dec 11 13:54:12 <ericwill>	akurtakov what is the procedure for making a method public? say if someone wanted to expose CTabFolder.shouldHighlight()?
Dec 11 13:54:17 <ericwill>	is it a complicated process?
Dec 11 13:54:27 <ericwill>	i.e. add it to the API
Dec 11 13:54:54 <akurtakov>	ericwill: well, open bz to make it public
Dec 11 13:55:02 <akurtakov>	document it proper 
Dec 11 13:55:24 <akurtakov>	if it's ws-specific document it in all ws subdirs
Dec 11 13:55:44 <akurtakov>	ideally have tests for it
Dec 11 13:55:58 <ericwill>	okay
Dec 11 13:56:17 <ericwill>	I ask because in this CTabFolder gerrit the guy asked about making it public to make junit testing easier
Dec 11 14:13:04 <akurtakov>	well, just for unit testing is bad 
Dec 11 14:13:12 <akurtakov>	it must have some real usage
Dec 11 14:13:37 <akurtakov>	if doesn't have such usage it's internal 
Dec 11 14:23:05 <ericwill>	akurtakov right now they are accessing the method in a junit test case using reflection
Dec 11 14:36:10 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: think i fixed the issue with putting everything in a separate thread and calling asyncExec from that separate thread on just the loadbytes part.. seems to avoid freezing ui.
Dec 11 14:36:31 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, I left a comment in patch
Dec 11 14:36:49 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, tennativley, seems good, but haven't tested yet.
Dec 11 14:39:12 <ericwill>	akurtakov how do you test this launcher issue?
Dec 11 14:40:20 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I build the natives
Dec 11 14:40:29 <akurtakov>	and copy the so file in launcher plugin
Dec 11 14:40:47 <akurtakov>	and eclipse executable in topdir of eclipse
Dec 11 14:40:51 <akurtakov>	that's separate eclipse I have 
Dec 11 14:40:56 <akurtakov>	just for that purporse
Dec 11 14:43:50 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: makes sense, i'll make the changes
Dec 11 14:43:57 <ericwill>	akurtakov hmm okay
Dec 11 14:44:05 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, kk. Let me know when ready for review.
Dec 11 14:44:16 <ericwill>	not sure I fully understand but I am not ready to test yet so I'll figure it out later
Dec 11 14:45:04 <akurtakov>	ericwill: launcher testing is quite complicated
Dec 11 14:45:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: you download eclipse
Dec 11 14:45:49 <akurtakov>	cd rt.equinox.framework/features/executable.feature
Dec 11 14:46:13 <akurtakov>	rt.equinox.framework/features/org.eclipse.equinox.executable.feature/library/gtk
Dec 11 14:46:19 <akurtakov>	./build.sh
Dec 11 14:46:43 <akurtakov>	there are two files produced 'eclipse' and 'eclipse_1628.so'
Dec 11 14:46:50 <akurtakov>	in the newly extracted eclipse
Dec 11 14:46:59 <akurtakov>	cp eclipse in the topdir
Dec 11 14:47:13 <akurtakov>	cp eclipse_1628.so in the plugins/*.launcher/
Dec 11 14:47:31 <akurtakov>	and launch eclipse using the just copied eclipse executable 
Dec 11 14:47:46 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay got it
Dec 11 15:30:00 <ericwill>	akurtakov your patch might be segfaulting in gdk_window_new() because you need to pass the address of GdkWindowAttr
Dec 11 15:30:19 <ericwill>	i.e. &attributes, not just attributes
Dec 11 15:30:24 <ericwill>	this is the first thing that comes to mind
Dec 11 15:30:35 <akurtakov>	ericwill: huh, I get compile warning if I try to pass attribs
Dec 11 15:30:39 <akurtakov>	no idea why
Dec 11 15:30:56 <akurtakov>	ericwill: too late for me
Dec 11 15:31:09 <ericwill>	akurtakov I will play around with it
Dec 11 15:31:24 <akurtakov>	it's worth trying whehter window is found enough via gdkatom at all
Dec 11 15:31:35 <akurtakov>	as I have a feeling this doesn't work
Dec 11 15:31:44 <akurtakov>	feel free to comment in the bz or gerrit
Dec 11 15:31:49 <akurtakov>	g'night
Dec 11 15:34:18 <ericwill>	goodnight!
Dec 11 16:20:18 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, setUrl good for merge/
Dec 11 16:20:19 <lufimtse>	?
Dec 11 16:40:11 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: hmm do you really like those block statements ?
Dec 11 16:47:14 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, If the function is more than a page long, then the blocks help reason about a function because they clarify scope of variables.
Dec 11 16:47:36 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, otherwise it's kinda hard to read the code.
Dec 11 16:47:47 <rgrunber>	i find it hard to read with the extra curlies :P
Dec 11 16:48:11 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, do you suggest to remove the curlies?
Dec 11 16:48:31 <rgrunber>	i don't mind, just didn't know if it was some kind of standard used within swt or not.
Dec 11 16:49:05 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, it's not an swt standard. But we have a lot of code in SWT that's like 3-4 pages per function.
Dec 11 16:49:14 <lufimtse>	reading and debugging that is a pain.
Dec 11 16:49:25 <lufimtse>	especially considering the C/Java type conversion business.
Dec 11 16:49:45 <lufimtse>	My line of logic is that if it's more than a page, then the code should either be put into blocks or a separate function.
Dec 11 16:49:51 <lufimtse>	as per clean-code guideline/
Dec 11 16:50:17 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, btw, patch looks good. Are we good to merge setUrl?
Dec 11 16:50:36 <rgrunber>	yeah, it should be fine now. tests can be added afterwards.
Dec 11 16:51:08 <rgrunber>	not too crazy about that 'final' stuff i had to do near the end but it's mainly just to pass in those variables.
Dec 11 17:10:49 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, still found another bug :-)
Dec 11 17:10:52 <lufimtse>	posted comment.
Dec 11 17:11:01 <lufimtse>	I'm off. C u Tomorrow.
Dec 11 17:11:09 <rgrunber>	k
Dec 12 10:20:33 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hey Eric
Dec 12 10:20:39 <akurtakov>	what are you up to?
Dec 12 10:21:00 <ericwill>	akurtakov hey, wayland launcher business and patch reviews
Dec 12 10:21:36 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I just pushed the latest changes 
Dec 12 10:21:44 <akurtakov>	using selection for display
Dec 12 10:21:50 <akurtakov>	but still it doesn't get any window
Dec 12 10:21:58 <akurtakov>	not sure what's going on
Dec 12 10:22:04 <akurtakov>	regarding reviews
Dec 12 10:22:17 <akurtakov>	just take the easiest ones first to reduce the noise :)
Dec 12 10:22:47 <ericwill>	akurtakov I am planning on reviewing those two CTabFolder patches from Andrey/Simeon
Dec 12 10:23:07 <akurtakov>	ok, whatever works for you :)
Dec 12 10:23:18 <akurtakov>	having them batched eases testing I guess 
Dec 12 10:23:44 <ericwill>	correct
Dec 12 10:23:58 <ericwill>	also for the launcher thing I see you filled out the GdkWindowAttr struct
Dec 12 10:24:06 <ericwill>	that was going to be my next suggestion :)
Dec 12 10:24:13 <ericwill>	I'll keep investigating today
Dec 12 10:25:24 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I can't make the window = gtk.gdk_selection_owner_get_for_display(display, launcherWindowAtom); return a window
Dec 12 10:25:36 <akurtakov>	it's always null ptr
Dec 12 10:26:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill: if you have any change/progress
Dec 12 10:26:22 <akurtakov>	feel free to push it when you're done today so I start from there
Dec 12 10:26:30 <akurtakov>	or mail with findings works too
Dec 12 10:27:00 <ericwill>	okay will do
Dec 12 10:30:23 <akurtakov>	ericwill: additionaly, if you make it work 
Dec 12 10:31:01 <akurtakov>	you'll need to modify swt to look for gdk atom and not x11 atom to see openFile really working
Dec 12 10:31:37 <akurtakov>	I'll prep a gerrit for that but just have it as low prio due to not really sure of gdk atom
Dec 12 10:32:05 <akurtakov>	there is smth about "known to the process" in gtk doc that troubles me
Dec 12 10:41:58 <ericwill>	akurtakov yeah I was just looking at that as well
Dec 12 10:42:07 <ericwill>	is the window being created in another process maybe?
Dec 12 10:42:21 <akurtakov>	yes
Dec 12 10:42:24 <akurtakov>	but that is the case
Dec 12 10:42:40 <akurtakov>	I can't launch new eclipse in the same process
Dec 12 11:04:52 <ericwill>	akurtakov for the launcher thing, is there an explicit need to check if a launcher window exists? why not create a fresh one each time?
Dec 12 11:04:57 <ericwill>	just thinking out loud
Dec 12 12:07:47 <ericwill>	akurtakov also when I do F3 on some of these GDK struct members, I get pointed to the gtk2 GDK stuff
Dec 12 12:07:54 <ericwill>	is equinox using GTK2 libs?
Dec 12 12:13:46 <ericwill>	looks like it is
Dec 12 12:15:19 <ericwill>	ah nvm figured it out
Dec 12 12:55:35 <akurtakov>	ericwill|lunch: the case should be if there is almost simultaneous launch 
Dec 12 12:59:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay
Dec 12 13:01:16 <akurtakov>	ericwill: the whole design is questionable IMHO
Dec 12 13:01:49 <akurtakov>	as the way it's implemented if you launch multiple eclipse instances at different version it's kind of weird
Dec 12 13:02:08 <ericwill>	agreed
Dec 12 13:02:14 <ericwill>	also I was reading the GdkSelection API
Dec 12 13:02:23 <ericwill>	and this is in the general description: "The X selection mechanism provides a way to transfer arbitrary chunks of data between programs."
Dec 12 13:02:37 <ericwill>	will gdk_selection_* work on Wayland?
Dec 12 13:04:04 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I think this is stale doc
Dec 12 13:05:45 <ericwill>	kk
Dec 12 13:07:40 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gdk/wayland/gdkwindow-wayland.c?h=gtk-3-22
Dec 12 13:12:37 <akurtakov>	ericwill: actually https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gdk/wayland/gdkdevice-wayland.c?h=gtk-3-22#n1151
Dec 12 13:12:51 <akurtakov>	if gtk devs use it in gdkdevice-wayland.c
Dec 12 13:12:56 <akurtakov>	it must be implemented
Dec 12 13:13:11 <ericwill>	yeah there is also gdkselection-wayland.c
Dec 12 13:13:18 <ericwill>	so I think you're right, just a stale doc
Dec 12 13:14:14 <akurtakov>	ericwill: it's worth opening a bug against gtk thought 
Dec 12 13:14:25 <akurtakov>	it will at least show them you RTFM :)
Dec 12 13:14:48 <ericwill>	will do
Dec 12 13:15:00 <ericwill>	so when I run this, if it doesn't segfault it hangs for about a minute before launching
Dec 12 13:15:03 <akurtakov>	should gain you some good will on your next question :)
Dec 12 13:15:03 <ericwill>	do you get that as well?
Dec 12 13:15:10 <akurtakov>	yes
Dec 12 13:15:13 <akurtakov>	that's normal
Dec 12 13:15:22 <akurtakov>	if you look deeper in the code
Dec 12 13:15:31 <akurtakov>	it has a timeout of 60 sec
Dec 12 13:16:18 <akurtakov>	ericwill: look for openFileTimeout
Dec 12 13:16:28 <akurtakov>	if you don't pass openFile there is no delay
Dec 12 13:16:54 <ericwill>	okay so that's what that is
Dec 12 13:16:57 <ericwill>	interesting
Dec 12 13:17:28 <akurtakov>	I was so close to starting it from scratch
Dec 12 13:17:46 <akurtakov>	but what I'm afraid of are these many undocumented cases which will bite us
Dec 12 13:18:34 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I still not get how it's decided to run jvm in process or fork it
Dec 12 13:19:24 <akurtakov>	this is one thing I remember on 32bit jvm is run in process of the launcher (aka no separate java process) on 64bit it's forked
Dec 12 13:20:00 <ericwill>	yeah this code is very confusing
Dec 12 13:20:05 <ericwill>	still the segfault is mysterious
Dec 12 13:20:11 <akurtakov>	oh yeah
Dec 12 13:20:20 <akurtakov>	it doesn't make sense at all
Dec 12 13:20:29 <akurtakov>	and the fact it's every second call
Dec 12 13:23:25 <ericwill>	so for gdk_window_new(), the bitmask has to represent certain parameters that were missing
Dec 12 13:23:36 <ericwill>	but after I changed that it still didn't fix it
Dec 12 13:24:56 <ericwill>	hmm
Dec 12 13:25:08 <ericwill>	CurrentTime is a macro in X11/X.h
Dec 12 13:46:33 <akurtakov>	oops, I missed that
Dec 12 13:56:24 <ericwill>	even changing it to GDK_CURRENT_TIME doesn't fix it
Dec 12 14:03:00 <akurtakov>	well, please push changes like that so we have less possible causes :)
Dec 12 14:06:49 <ericwill>	will do at the end of the day, right now I am just experimenting around with stuff
Dec 12 14:11:16 <akurtakov>	sure
Dec 13 10:00:02 <ericwill>	akurtakov any updates on the launcher stuff? I see you made some changes
Dec 13 10:02:47 <akurtakov>	I fixed the crash
Dec 13 10:02:52 <akurtakov>	and the delay
Dec 13 10:03:04 <akurtakov>	ericwill: the crash was stupid me failing with function declaration sigh
Dec 13 10:03:21 <akurtakov>	now it's up to atom not finding launcher
Dec 13 10:03:45 <akurtakov>	I have issue with not understanding how this whole thing work
Dec 13 10:04:26 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I mean how does it relate atom to window
Dec 13 10:04:43 <ericwill>	you mean GdkWindowAttr* instead of just GdkWindowAttr :)
Dec 13 10:04:46 <ericwill>	I hate these little things
Dec 13 10:05:05 <ericwill>	okay I will continue to look at it today, at least now it isn't crashing which is good
Dec 13 10:05:21 <akurtakov>	and the one min delay is gone too :)
Dec 13 10:07:10 <ericwill>	excellent, I see you added gdk_flush too
Dec 13 10:09:38 <ericwill>	akurtakov btw unrelated to this, but yesterday in the gtk IRC channel mclasen and Benjamin were talking about the future of a11y on GTK4
Dec 13 10:10:04 <ericwill>	mclasen said they will not drop a11y support but there are very few people to maintain/fix it
Dec 13 10:10:52 <ericwill>	Benjamin wants to drop support for it as he doesn't have the time to maintain it
Dec 13 10:10:56 <ericwill>	just something you should be aware of
Dec 13 10:20:36 <akurtakov>	ericwill: well, I don't think it will be dropped
Dec 13 10:20:43 <akurtakov>	it's mandatory for some government stuff
Dec 13 10:21:31 <akurtakov>	removing it will render gtk apps out of such env
Dec 13 10:21:59 <ericwill>	I don't think it will be dropped either
Dec 14 09:21:05 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hey Leo
Dec 14 09:21:08 <akurtakov>	congrats on the promotion
Dec 14 10:06:52 <ericwill>	akurtakov I think DBus is the way to go
Dec 14 10:07:01 <ericwill>	I spoke to lufimtse about it yesterday, he may have some thoughts
Dec 14 10:21:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, omg
Dec 14 11:31:03 <akurtakov>	ericwill: about dbus?
Dec 14 11:31:26 <ericwill>	akurtakov yes, we just spoke about some generalities
Dec 14 11:31:55 <akurtakov>	ok, how does it sound?
Dec 14 11:33:07 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I would like to see launcher fixed
Dec 14 11:33:26 <akurtakov>	having a crasher is definetely not what I want to see
Dec 14 11:33:36 <akurtakov>	I have added it to the plan 
Dec 14 11:33:48 <akurtakov>	assigned to me but I can reasign it to you if you want
Dec 14 11:34:07 <akurtakov>	it is smth that both of us will keep an eye on
Dec 14 11:34:27 <ericwill>	I think the dbus approach is doable since now we are re-writing it instead of trying to fix the old design
Dec 14 11:34:46 <akurtakov>	yup
Dec 14 11:35:03 <akurtakov>	have you seen that property_notify is removed
Dec 14 11:35:06 <akurtakov>	in gtk4 now
Dec 14 11:35:26 <ericwill>	I saw
Dec 14 11:36:06 <ericwill>	IMO this is the least of our worries for GTK4 :) they are changing the drawing vfuncs for GtkWidgetClass
Dec 14 11:36:09 <akurtakov>	so I feel really bad changing smth now that is likely to crash on me in the next year again (assuming gtk 4.0 is released and we start porting)
Dec 14 11:36:28 <akurtakov>	ericwill: well, true 
Dec 14 11:36:43 <akurtakov>	but on the other hand we should do some forward thinking when we write things
Dec 14 11:37:13 <ericwill>	agreed
Dec 14 11:37:31 <ericwill>	okay so for this sprint and next one (since PTO is a half of this sprint) I will look at launcher dbus and a11y
Dec 14 12:03:22 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: do you have any concern over dbus in swt ?
Dec 14 12:05:56 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what do you mean?
Dec 14 12:06:16 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: for the launcher
Dec 14 12:06:19 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, at the moment DBus is localized to webkit extension. But I could extract it and make it a more global interface
Dec 14 12:06:30 <akurtakov>	you have read my email, right?
Dec 14 12:06:45 <akurtakov>	to the team list
Dec 14 12:07:03 <akurtakov>	with link to the launcher bug and proposal how to do it over dbus
Dec 14 12:07:58 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah, I didn't quite get to email yet
Dec 14 12:08:01 *	lufimtse reading
Dec 14 12:09:54 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I don't see any issues with having dbus in swt, except it would be confined to linux.
Dec 14 12:10:10 <lufimtse>	I'd be happy to work on it.
Dec 14 12:10:15 <akurtakov>	well, x11 stuff is there too 
Dec 14 12:10:20 <lufimtse>	wouldn't take me that long as I know dbus mostly.
Dec 14 12:11:00 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: you think the idea is viable ?
Dec 14 12:11:34 <akurtakov>	if ericwill is willing to trade with your bugfixes that would be fine with me
Dec 14 12:11:58 <akurtakov>	as I've been keeping him in the loop for the launcher changes
Dec 14 12:12:29 <ericwill>	I am willing to trade as lufimtse knows more about dbus
Dec 14 12:12:33 <akurtakov>	maybe even Leo does the swt interface implementation, Eric does the launcher changes to poll for the service and call the method
Dec 14 12:12:36 <ericwill>	which bugfixes do you speak of?
Dec 14 12:12:52 <akurtakov>	ericwill: gtk3 general issues
Dec 14 12:12:53 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I am happy to work on *
Dec 14 12:13:02 <lufimtse>	where * is what is the most important.
Dec 14 12:13:24 <akurtakov>	well, the launcher fix is smth I would like to see ASAP :)
Dec 14 12:13:50 <akurtakov>	and having a proper working dbus interface exposed by swt would be quite nice
Dec 14 12:16:40 <ericwill>	it will probably be faster for Leo to work on the launcher business as he knows more about dbus than I do
Dec 14 12:16:51 <ericwill>	I wouldn't mind working on the menu popup bug that we have in the RH BZ
Dec 14 12:17:02 <ericwill>	alongside a11y
Dec 14 12:17:27 *	rgrunber mumbles something about slow trees on linux
Dec 14 12:19:32 <akurtakov>	ericwill: agreed
Dec 14 12:19:41 <akurtakov>	but I would like to see more bugs
Dec 14 12:20:18 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=528789
Dec 14 12:20:22 <akurtakov>	as you opened it
Dec 14 12:20:47 <ericwill>	akurtakov as I said this morning to Leo, "he who discovers the bug shall be the one to fix it"
Dec 14 12:20:53 <ericwill>	I'll work on it
Dec 14 12:20:55 <ericwill>	np
Dec 14 12:23:33 <ericwill>	I will update my spring stuff in JIRA
Dec 14 12:23:42 <akurtakov>	ok
Dec 14 12:23:54 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=528346
Dec 14 12:24:03 <akurtakov>	is there anything left for this one or we should fix it?
Dec 14 12:26:20 <akurtakov>	close it I mean
Dec 14 12:29:55 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I think probably close as it would be too time consuming to weedout stuff from webkit1. Can I look into it later today/tomorrow and post a definitive comment/close it?
Dec 14 12:30:08 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: sure
Dec 14 12:30:34 <akurtakov>	as long as it's either closed or it's clear what's left it works for me
Dec 14 12:40:32 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=528155
Dec 14 12:40:44 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I have a request for better bug handling
Dec 14 12:40:59 <akurtakov>	would you please spend up to one hour per day
Dec 14 12:41:10 <akurtakov>	on triaging/reviewing patches and etc.
Dec 14 12:42:25 <ericwill>	akurtakov I'll take a look
Dec 14 12:42:55 <akurtakov>	and https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=528284
Dec 14 12:43:11 <akurtakov>	that should be enough for now
Dec 14 12:43:27 <ericwill>	akurtakov I saw that one, was waiting for the bug reporter to respond to Andrey
Dec 14 12:48:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok on bug handling.
Dec 14 12:49:44 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I've emailed you/Sopot a list of project options 
Dec 14 12:49:56 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, with voting system :-)
Dec 14 12:50:04 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, s/vote/point
Dec 14 12:53:09 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, btw, I've added the DBus bindings thing as "GDBus bindings in SWT" on the project list.
Dec 14 12:53:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Line 16
Dec 14 12:53:50 <akurtakov>	well, I don't get that part
Dec 14 12:54:05 <akurtakov>	what such a binding is about
Dec 14 12:54:05 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I don't know either :-)
Dec 14 12:54:24 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, you/eric talk about this dbus stuff, not really sure what needs to be done yet.
Dec 14 12:54:39 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I just know how dbus works and can do  what is needed.
Dec 14 12:54:41 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: read the bug
Dec 14 12:54:52 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok.
Dec 14 12:55:02 <akurtakov>	there is a link in the mail where what's needed is detailed
Dec 14 12:55:45 <akurtakov>	IMHO this work shouldn't take more than 2 weeks 
Dec 14 12:56:03 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I do want to outline that it would be good to update the swt website documentation, as we've now had 4 people say that they wanted to contribute to swt but found the documentation very confusing.
Dec 14 12:56:21 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, it's a fairly short project and hash high long-term pay off.
Dec 14 12:56:24 <lufimtse>	*potential
Dec 14 12:56:27 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: this is not a project
Dec 14 12:56:35 <akurtakov>	this is constant ongoing thing
Dec 14 12:56:46 <akurtakov>	whenever smth is spotted it should be changed ASAP
Dec 14 12:56:51 <akurtakov>	at the cost of 1/2 h
Dec 14 12:56:54 <akurtakov>	and so on
Dec 14 12:56:58 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, we're off to lunch
Dec 14 12:57:01 <lufimtse>	back in an hour ish
Dec 14 12:57:54 <akurtakov>	I'm not signing off someone spending time on website or swt tools as anything but side project to be improved on the go
Dec 14 14:48:10 <ericwill>	fun fact: gerrit has file matching, you can filter patches that only touch linux files
Dec 14 14:48:21 <ericwill>	using this gerrit search term: project:platform/eclipse.platform.swt file:gtk status:open
Dec 14 14:48:31 <ericwill>	lufimtse ^
Dec 14 15:39:11 <lufimtse>	r
Dec 15 09:09:28 <akurtakov>	hey guys
Dec 15 09:20:32 <ericwill>	hello
Dec 15 09:24:33 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I'm leaving you guys with 850 open bugs :)
Dec 15 09:24:46 <akurtakov>	try to not let it increase by Jan 3rd :)
Dec 15 09:25:09 <ericwill>	haha
Dec 15 09:25:20 <ericwill>	akurtakov we will keep the house nice and tidy for you while you're gone :)
Dec 15 09:25:37 <akurtakov>	ericwill: the way I like it :)
Dec 15 11:49:34 <akurtakov>	do you guys use java 9 ?
Dec 15 12:02:05 <ericwill>	akurtakov no
Dec 15 12:08:18 <ericwill>	akurtakov lufimtse can we have a monthly SWT call? I feel it would be useful to keep everyone on track and up to date
Dec 15 12:08:39 <ericwill>	doesn't have to be long, maybe 30mins
Dec 15 12:09:00 <lufimtse>	maybe once a month after main call or something.
Dec 15 12:09:12 <lufimtse>	or in separate time, I don't mind either way.
Dec 15 12:09:33 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I deny discussing such thing right before vacation :)
Dec 15 12:09:49 <akurtakov>	remind me next year :P
Dec 15 12:11:05 <ericwill>	akurtakov haha okay :)
Dec 15 12:18:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok. SWT Plan is ready for your/Sopot review. (Not urgent, can be reviewed next year if you like. Just a verification of what we talked about).
Dec 15 12:18:21 <lufimtse>	-> emailed.
Dec 15 12:19:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I shall now begin my journey to Fedora 27 and Wayland. My enlightenment shall begin. See you on the other side.
Dec 15 12:19:59 <akurtakov>	:)
Dec 15 12:25:09 <akurtakov>	I have provided some feedback 
Dec 15 12:25:37 <akurtakov>	please incorporate it in the doc :)

Dec 15 15:59:55 <lufimtse>	It's possible that you meant to highlight the 'black/white' business and selected openGL text instead

Dec 22 11:33:47 <ericwill>	also yeah there are quite a few outstanding issues on wayland I am noticing

Jan 03 10:12:08 <rgrunber>	give me your codes!
Jan 03 10:12:19 <ericwill>	give me the codes Natalya!
Jan 03 10:12:26 <rgrunber>	ericwill: yes.. i was going for that
Jan 03 10:12:36 <rgrunber>	ericwill: he is just a level 3 programmer...
Jan 03 11:15:13 <ericwill>	akurtakov is this bug still a priority, given that it's CCombo? https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=528284
Jan 03 11:15:45 <akurtakov>	it's quite visible
Jan 03 11:15:56 <akurtakov>	and installing CDT* brings it in
Jan 03 11:16:01 <akurtakov>	so I would say yes
Jan 03 11:16:24 <akurtakov>	unless you can port and convince tcf guys to accept patch changing ti to plain Combo :)
Jan 03 11:16:31 <akurtakov>	that is fine fix too IMHO
Jan 03 11:18:46 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=529371 FYI provoked by me looking at the glib funcs today :)

Jan 03 11:19:16 <ericwill>	yeah I saw that
Jan 03 11:19:17 <akurtakov>	should help with later work on ATK - keep atk * funcs bindings in ATK :)

Jan 03 12:07:43 <rgrunber>	if you can.. just to confirm the seturl with post stuff on mac
Jan 03 13:50:09 <akurtakov>	ericwill: so is the patch for custom drawing ready for review
Jan 03 13:50:21 <ericwill>	akurtakov yes
Jan 03 13:50:25 <ericwill>	I wanted to know your thoughts
Jan 03 13:55:58 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, will test tomorrow
Jan 03 13:58:36 <ericwill>	sounds good
Jan 03 13:59:13 <akurtakov>	ericwill: as a first thing https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.22/ch26s02.html#id-1.6.3.4.11
Jan 03 13:59:57 <akurtakov>	ericwill: IIRC expose event is fired only for widgets that have windows
Jan 03 14:00:22 <akurtakov>	which is kind of implementation detail thus the approach could be fragile
Jan 03 14:01:04 <ericwill>	akurtakov on GTK3 EXPOSE_EVENT is aliased to draw
Jan 03 14:01:14 <ericwill>	Display line 3552
Jan 03 14:01:53 <ericwill>	same with EXPOSE_EVENT_INVERSE
Jan 03 14:05:30 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ah, I forgot about that
Jan 03 14:06:11 <akurtakov>	so why not using draw directly 
Jan 03 14:07:29 <ericwill>	akurtakov what do you mean
Jan 03 14:09:58 <akurtakov>	ericwill: Widget.java#3442 
Jan 03 14:11:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill: anyway, should be fine that way
Jan 03 14:11:17 <ericwill>	akurtakov that line number doesn't exist in Widget :)
Jan 03 14:11:36 <akurtakov>	doh 149
Jan 03 14:11:54 <ericwill>	ah yeah
Jan 03 14:13:09 <akurtakov>	ericwill: just a small thing to prevent me misreading it next time :)
Jan 03 14:13:46 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay I'll fix it for tomorrow
Jan 03 14:14:04 <akurtakov>	ericwill: why the need for expose_event_inverse
Jan 03 14:14:28 <akurtakov>	just curious 
Jan 03 14:14:40 *	akurtakov badly needs clean gtk3 impl
Jan 03 14:15:29 <ericwill>	akurtakov not sure, I copied what was done in Control, just changed the handles
Jan 03 14:15:44 <ericwill>	maybe not necessary?
Jan 03 14:16:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: worth checking
Jan 03 14:16:32 <ericwill>	okay will do
Jan 03 14:16:55 <ericwill>	also if you think the GTK3 drawing is bad in Control/Widget...wait till you see Table/Tree :)
Jan 03 14:16:59 <ericwill>	total mess

Jan 05 12:12:26 <akurtakov>	ericwill: would you please take the positioning bug as a prio after the current one
Jan 05 12:12:37 <ericwill>	akurtakov yes
Jan 05 12:12:38 <ericwill>	will do
Jan 05 12:12:49 <akurtakov>	ericwill: cool
Jan 05 12:12:54 <ericwill>	one more table/tree patch to be merged today and then I will get started on it
Jan 05 12:13:01 <akurtakov>	perfect
Jan 05 12:13:14 <akurtakov>	is it the not rendered button ?
Jan 05 12:14:14 <ericwill>	no, it's this one: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=528155
Jan 05 12:14:25 <ericwill>	haven't investigated the missing button one yet
Jan 05 12:14:28 <akurtakov>	ah ok
Jan 05 12:14:36 <akurtakov>	I forgot about this one
Jan 05 12:14:46 <akurtakov>	better to concentrate on the easy wins I agree
Jan 05 12:14:59 <akurtakov>	but client issues have their prio too :)
Jan 05 12:15:56 <ericwill>	that paintitem bug ended up being more difficult than I thought
Jan 05 12:16:02 <ericwill>	the menu one is important yeah
Jan 05 12:16:16 <ericwill>	as I see these mis-positioned menus all over the place
Jan 05 12:58:37 <ericwill>	lufimtse rgrunber_afk webkit crash on hudson, is this something you guys are expecting/know about? https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.swt-Gerrit/5938/console
Jan 05 13:00:07 <lufimtse>	webkit1 by the looks
Jan 05 13:00:14 <ericwill>	kk will re-trigger
Jan 05 13:22:23 <akurtakov>	ericwill: centos2 is 7.4 so it has webkit2 but hippcentos is 7.2 so webkit1
Jan 05 13:22:35 <ericwill>	akurtakov aha
Jan 05 13:22:36 <ericwill>	kk
Jan 05 13:22:49 <akurtakov>	I convinced webmaster to update only one machine before christmas :)

Jan 11 09:59:39 *	Now talking on #SWT
Jan 11 12:43:53 <ericwill>	akurtakov just curious: what is the timeline for supporting only one version of GTK3 (3.22)?
Jan 11 12:55:25 <akurtakov>	ericwill: it would not happen in the next 2 years 
Jan 11 12:56:01 <akurtakov>	it depends on flatpak being de-facto standard distribution for eclipse IMHO
Jan 11 12:56:16 <ericwill>	okay
Jan 11 12:56:19 <ericwill>	I was just curious
Jan 11 12:57:48 <akurtakov>	ericwill: unless we ship with flatpak by default we would never be able to rely on single gtk version
Jan 11 12:58:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill: this doesn't mean I'm not going to try to remove gtk 2 support soon
Jan 11 12:58:41 <ericwill>	:)
Jan 11 12:59:04 <akurtakov>	as soon as there is gtk4 beta declared
Jan 11 12:59:12 <akurtakov>	I'll use that as an excuse 
Jan 11 12:59:21 <akurtakov>	aka we start to prepare the codebase for it
Jan 11 12:59:33 <akurtakov>	have you heard of any timeline for it ?
Jan 11 13:01:59 <ericwill>	no
Jan 11 13:02:06 <ericwill>	but based on the roadmap: https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK%2B/Roadmap/GTK4
Jan 11 13:02:08 <ericwill>	I would say at least a year
Jan 15 12:00:33 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hey Eric
Jan 15 12:01:10 <ericwill>	akurtakov hey, what's up
Jan 15 12:01:20 <akurtakov>	ericwill: any idea about https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500703
Jan 15 12:02:17 <ericwill>	akurtakov that is a tough bug. with GTK3.20 and above it's almost impossible to get widgets smaller than their min-size
Jan 15 12:03:27 <ericwill>	IIRC I can fix the overdrawing but the Combo will still get cutoff on the side
Jan 15 12:04:44 <akurtakov>	hmm
Jan 15 12:05:20 <akurtakov>	so "almost" should be removed from your statement :)
Jan 15 12:05:51 <akurtakov>	I think I get the 
Jan 15 12:05:59 <akurtakov>	idea of the toolbar 
Jan 15 12:06:23 <ericwill>	well we can shrink the parent container, it's just that the widgets inside the container don't get smaller past their min-size
Jan 15 12:06:28 <ericwill>	what about mean about the toolbar
Jan 15 12:06:59 <akurtakov>	it's ptobably toolitem size vs button size 
Jan 15 12:07:50 <ericwill>	for the TCF thing?
Jan 15 12:07:56 <ericwill>	yes
Jan 15 12:08:00 <ericwill>	toolbuttons are a lot smaller
Jan 15 12:08:26 <akurtakov>	so how does the fix looks
Jan 15 12:08:36 <akurtakov>	for the combo bug
Jan 15 12:08:43 <akurtakov>	can you give me a screenshot
Jan 15 12:09:16 <ericwill>	for the garbled combo issue? sure give me a second
Jan 15 12:13:16 <ericwill>	akurtakov if you run that snippet that comes with the bug, this is what the largest item in the combo looks like if you make the window smaller than the min-size: https://i.imgur.com/BD9bmE1.png
Jan 15 12:13:50 <ericwill>	not ideal as the drop drown button is missing, but better than having the overdrawing of text IMO
Jan 15 12:14:01 <akurtakov>	does it fix the preference page ?
Jan 15 12:14:38 <ericwill>	where in the preferences page does it happen
Jan 15 12:14:40 <ericwill>	I can check
Jan 15 12:15:08 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1533913
Jan 15 12:16:55 <ericwill>	it fixes the overdrawing, but if the name selected in the combo is short then you don't see the text at all
Jan 15 12:16:58 <ericwill>	not an ideal fix IMO
Jan 15 12:19:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov I guess we have to honor SWT API and allow any size to be set right? we can't enforce GTK's min sizes right?
Jan 15 12:19:33 <akurtakov>	no we can't
Jan 15 12:19:47 <akurtakov>	dinner time
Jan 15 12:19:49 <akurtakov>	ttyl
Jan 15 12:20:36 <ericwill>	okay see ya
Jan 15 13:00:32 <akurtakov>	so the fix doesn't work for the Keys page right?
Jan 15 13:09:10 <ericwill>	akurtakov it's not ideal. so I say no
Jan 15 13:09:31 <ericwill>	akurtakov about the TCF bug...what do you think is the best way to fix it. Try to fix it in SWT or re-write their code
Jan 15 13:09:40 <ericwill>	if it is a min-size issue then fixing it will be tough
Jan 15 13:10:42 <akurtakov>	well, both
Jan 15 13:10:56 <akurtakov>	rewrite and fix the min size issue
Jan 15 13:11:28 <akurtakov>	in any order :)
Jan 15 13:11:41 <ericwill>	ha
Jan 15 13:11:42 <ericwill>	:P
Jan 15 13:11:58 <ericwill>	okay I'll keep working on it
Jan 15 13:40:11 <akurtakov>	ericwill: about combo
Jan 15 13:40:20 <akurtakov>	I have a feeling the issue is entry's size
Jan 15 13:41:07 <ericwill>	akurtakov yeah it is. Combo determines its min-size based on the size of the largest entry
Jan 15 13:41:08 <akurtakov>	if you look at control example 
Jan 15 13:41:23 <akurtakov>	any change in size caused terrible breakage
Jan 15 13:42:34 <akurtakov>	ericwill: but adding if (entryHandle != 0) OS.gtk_entry_set_width_chars(entryHandle, 0); at line 1976
Jan 15 13:42:40 <akurtakov>	improves a lot
Jan 15 13:43:15 <akurtakov>	so if some pango calculation is done to trim the visible part
Jan 15 13:43:18 <akurtakov>	it might work
Jan 15 13:44:00 <akurtakov>	although I don't know whether it feasible to differ between visible and invisible size
Jan 15 13:44:30 <akurtakov>	s/size/content/
Jan 15 13:44:42 <ericwill>	let me look one sec
Jan 15 13:45:24 <ericwill>	so you want to set the width of the entry to 0 if the Combo is being resized?
Jan 15 13:46:13 <ericwill>	but doesn't the bug happen when a long combo item is selected?
Jan 15 13:51:45 <ericwill>	also I think this issue you speak of is different, entryHandle is only used for editable Combo boxes
Jan 15 13:51:56 <akurtakov>	yeah
Jan 15 13:52:01 <akurtakov>	I know I can't set it that way
Jan 15 13:52:29 <akurtakov>	if it would worlk it must be dynamic calculated from pango
Jan 15 13:53:10 <akurtakov>	so the given width parameter
Jan 15 13:53:33 <akurtakov>	is used to determine first N chars that fit in it
Jan 15 13:53:51 <akurtakov>	and max_width_chars is set to N
Jan 15 13:54:19 <akurtakov>	I assume READ_ONLY combo uses labels
Jan 15 13:54:31 <akurtakov>	in which case some similar trimming would have to be done
Jan 15 13:56:34 <ericwill>	hmm we have access to the cellHandle
Jan 15 13:56:39 <akurtakov>	hmm, it's GtkToggleButton
Jan 15 13:58:28 <ericwill>	yeah
Jan 15 13:58:34 <akurtakov>	anyway, this is the direction I think towards
Jan 15 13:58:44 <ericwill>	okay
Jan 15 13:58:55 <ericwill>	how do we determine the max width to trim to?
Jan 15 14:12:47 <akurtakov>	pango_layout_get_width/size 
Jan 15 14:12:50 <akurtakov>	or smth similar
Jan 15 14:13:08 <akurtakov>	see TextLayout.getBoundsInPixels
Jan 15 14:14:16 <ericwill>	okay
Jan 15 14:35:51 <akurtakov>	what about https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_min-width.asp ?
Jan 15 14:46:31 <ericwill>	should work
Jan 15 14:46:46 <ericwill>	I have never experimented with min-width CSS but it's part of the GTK3 API
Jan 15 15:16:55 <akurtakov>	btw
Jan 15 15:16:57 <akurtakov>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=511133
Jan 15 15:17:08 <akurtakov>	this looks like invisible button issue again right?
Jan 15 15:17:10 <akurtakov>	is it a dupe
Jan 15 15:17:52 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ^^
Jan 15 15:18:22 <ericwill>	akurtakov looks like a dupe to me
Jan 15 15:18:32 <akurtakov>	please verify and mark as such
Jan 15 15:19:34 <akurtakov>	if it truey is
Jan 15 15:20:14 <akurtakov>	er
Jan 15 15:20:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw
Jan 15 15:20:25 <akurtakov>	open resource dialog
Jan 15 15:20:35 <akurtakov>	click on the "Show in" button
Jan 15 15:20:40 <akurtakov>	see where the popup appears
Jan 15 15:20:49 <akurtakov>	under wayland
Jan 15 15:20:51 <akurtakov>	everytime
Jan 15 15:21:09 <ericwill>	akurtakov nice, a reproducer
Jan 15 15:21:11 <ericwill>	this will help
Jan 15 15:21:18 <akurtakov>	glad to help
Jan 15 15:21:52 <akurtakov>	started from http://git.eclipse.org/c/pde/eclipse.pde.ui.git/commit/?id=2ceaba32ad961bb49614ea700b18adcb046f8d13 :)
Jan 15 15:22:00 <akurtakov>	can you believe where things lead :)
Jan 15 15:22:48 <ericwill>	all these things are interconnected in the strangest of ways haha
Jan 15 15:24:50 <ericwill>	akurtakov so https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=511133 is not a dupe
Jan 15 15:24:55 <ericwill>	I can still reproduce the issue on master
Jan 15 15:25:04 <akurtakov>	huh?
Jan 15 15:25:14 <akurtakov>	I thought you fixed it :0
Jan 15 15:25:25 *	akurtakov jokes
Jan 15 15:27:03 <ericwill>	har har har :P
Jan 15 15:27:49 <ericwill>	akurtakov do you want me to add that bug to my to-do list?
Jan 15 15:28:08 <akurtakov>	well, how long it is?
Jan 15 15:29:58 <ericwill>	TCF issue, menu popup issue, that's it as of today
Jan 15 15:48:03 <akurtakov>	ok
Jan 15 15:48:08 <akurtakov>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=493213
Jan 15 15:48:17 <akurtakov>	is it a dupe of the bug I thought as dupe ?
Jan 15 15:48:50 <ericwill>	yup :)
Jan 15 15:48:52 <ericwill>	same window
Jan 15 15:59:40 <akurtakov>	816 open
Jan 15 15:59:50 <akurtakov>	next goal <800
Jan 15 16:27:45 <ericwill>	nice :) maybe we can get under 500 by the end of the year
Jan 15 16:29:38 <akurtakov>	this https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=379369 should be fixed right?
Jan 15 16:30:40 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ^
Jan 15 16:31:17 <ericwill>	akurtakov yes it should be
Jan 16 10:28:40 <ericwill>	akurtakov Christian Hergert is looking for someone to add OmniSharp language server support to GNOME builder
Jan 16 10:51:20 <akurtakov>	ericwill: not gonna be us :)
Jan 16 10:53:07 <akurtakov>	ericwill: or you want to do that ?
Jan 16 10:53:26 <ericwill>	akurtakov no, I was just sharing since there is all the hype about language servers now :)
Jan 16 10:53:32 <rgrunber>	if they already support adding language server clients, which iirc they do.. it shouldn't be that complicated.. mostly boilerplate code if they have something like lsp4e.. either way..
Jan 16 10:53:52 <rgrunber>	^ mainly implying anyone could probably do it.. so doesn't really need to be us.
Jan 16 10:55:17 <rgrunber>	or maybe it's a WIP.. https://builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/langserv.html
Jan 16 10:56:56 <akurtakov>	the issue is going to be mostly having omnisharp behave proper
Jan 16 10:59:53 <akurtakov>	is Leo at work?
Jan 16 11:02:08 <ericwill>	yes, lufimtse ^
Jan 16 11:02:39 <lufimtse>	hai
Jan 16 11:02:47 <lufimtse>	I'm at work todya.
Jan 16 11:03:43 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, sup
Jan 16 11:04:05 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=525305  << I expected 1-2 days of work. Worth it?
Jan 16 11:04:15 <lufimtse>	After launcher patch is tested/merged.
Jan 16 11:04:20 <lufimtse>	wdyt?
Jan 16 11:47:15 <akurtakov>	not this week
Jan 16 11:47:28 <akurtakov>	I would like to see as much bug fixes as possible to go for M5
Jan 16 11:47:41 <akurtakov>	next week is quiet week so it's fine to work on openURL
Jan 16 12:15:20 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: so does the launcher work for under Wayland ?
Jan 16 12:18:28 <akurtakov>	btw, under 800 :)
Jan 16 12:18:49 <akurtakov>	let's see when will we hit 750
Jan 16 13:49:00 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: what's broken
Jan 16 13:53:20 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, working on figuring out that part :-)
Jan 16 13:53:35 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, maybe I build something wrong. Investigating.
Jan 16 14:12:15 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I think posted a false alarm. Actually seems to work.
Jan 16 14:12:33 <lufimtse>	some build issue on my computer.
Jan 16 14:12:45 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: that's the issues I prefer 
Jan 16 14:12:52 <akurtakov>	PEBKAC :)
Jan 16 14:13:03 <lufimtse>	PEBKAC?
Jan 16 14:14:17 <akurtakov>	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/PEBKAC
Jan 16 14:15:16 <ericwill>	lmao
Jan 16 14:15:18 <ericwill>	I never heard this one before :)
Jan 16 14:15:30 <lufimtse>	ha ha
Jan 17 10:19:15 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: i'll be bugging you about a mac box very soon
Jan 17 10:20:27 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, ok
Jan 17 11:36:43 <akurtakov>	ericwill: do you have tcf gerrit ?
Jan 17 11:37:12 <ericwill>	akurtakov no, I'm about to post in the bug filed against TCF
Jan 17 11:37:27 <ericwill>	I want to see if I can get some discussion going
Jan 17 11:37:42 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, I wonder whether I can push to tcf
Jan 17 11:38:34 <akurtakov>	ah Martin is there
Jan 17 11:38:43 <akurtakov>	I'll ping him as soon as you have patch
Jan 17 11:39:17 <ericwill>	I mean the patch is just a one-line fix
Jan 17 11:39:29 <ericwill>	ideally they will change this contribution to something a little more sane
Jan 17 11:39:48 <ericwill>	i.e. a ToolItem instead of this label/label/button scheme
Jan 17 11:40:45 <akurtakov>	it must be wrapped in toolitem ?
Jan 17 11:40:55 <akurtakov>	otherwise it can't be put in the toolbar
Jan 17 11:41:04 <akurtakov>	btw, don't expect too much
Jan 17 11:41:24 <akurtakov>	tcf is in deep maintenance mode so best we will achieve is get our patch pushed
Jan 17 11:42:11 <ericwill>	okay maybe I will just push the patch then haha
Jan 17 11:42:24 <ericwill>	I don't want to get stuck maintaining this code anyways, it's setup is weird
Jan 17 11:43:39 <akurtakov>	well, maintain no 
Jan 17 11:43:45 <akurtakov>	not until gtk4 breaks it :)
Jan 17 11:45:26 <ericwill>	okay
Jan 17 11:45:30 <ericwill>	I will push the patch
Jan 17 11:55:27 <ericwill>	akurtakov https://git.eclipse.org/r/115547
Jan 17 12:02:07 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, have you attached old vs new to the tcf bug ?
Jan 17 12:02:13 <akurtakov>	after both swt and your change
Jan 17 12:02:44 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, but ID is weird in this patch :)
Jan 17 12:02:56 *	akurtakov is quite surprised :)
Jan 17 12:03:35 <ericwill>	I haven't, I will soon
Jan 17 12:03:41 <ericwill>	also which ID is weird? :P
Jan 17 12:04:52 <akurtakov>	ericwill: 52874 
Jan 17 12:04:57 <akurtakov>	5 digit only bug ?
Jan 17 12:05:06 <ericwill>	akurtakov oops
Jan 17 12:05:06 <akurtakov>	GTK3 was not a thing back then
Jan 17 12:05:14 <ericwill>	yeah that is typo, I'll fix it
Jan 17 12:05:27 <ericwill>	I also just realized there is compile warning with the SWT
Jan 17 12:05:28 <ericwill>	derp
Jan 17 12:05:31 *	ericwill fixes
Jan 17 12:14:31 <ericwill>	done
Jan 17 12:14:34 <akurtakov>	ok
Jan 17 12:15:08 <akurtakov>	ericwill|lunch: it doesn't look good yet
Jan 17 12:15:12 <akurtakov>	but better at least
Jan 17 12:43:11 <ericwill>	akurtakov the way the thing is set up is really ugly. I think it worked on GTK2 because everything was small and fit nicely
Jan 17 12:43:16 <ericwill>	GTK3...different story :)
Jan 17 12:58:55 <akurtakov>	ericwill: well, the only constant thing is change
Jan 17 12:58:57 <akurtakov>	:)
Jan 17 13:00:24 <akurtakov>	ericwill: wow, your patch pushed
Jan 17 13:03:28 <ericwill>	akurtakov I saw :) it was a simple fix I guess
Jan 17 13:03:51 <akurtakov>	do you think you can easily change it to smth sane ?>
Jan 17 13:04:01 <akurtakov>	I mean in a day (at most) effort
Jan 17 13:05:15 <ericwill>	akurtakov maybe...I'd have to think about it
Jan 17 13:05:28 <ericwill>	right now I want to try and fix the egit icons before M5
Jan 17 13:20:29 <akurtakov>	ericwill: +1
Jan 17 13:21:02 <akurtakov>	ericwill: are you obsessed with tree cell renderers now :)
Jan 17 13:21:42 <ericwill>	akurtakov I have spent enough time in Table/Tree code the last few weeks that it is becoming too familiar :)

Jan 18 10:03:26 *	Now talking on #SWT
Jan 19 11:20:48 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hey
Jan 19 11:20:50 <akurtakov>	any progress on the crash?
Jan 19 11:20:52 <akurtakov>	what about rhel 7 testing ?
Jan 19 12:17:02 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, crash? Lemmme check
Jan 19 12:17:19 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: the one you were supposed to work on
Jan 19 12:17:29 <lufimtse>	The Segfault
Jan 19 12:17:30 <lufimtse>	ah,
Jan 19 12:17:36 <akurtakov>	sefault if you prefer it that way :)
Jan 19 12:17:40 <lufimtse>	ha ha, my brain didn't link 
Jan 19 12:18:03 <lufimtse>	Still kinda researching
Jan 19 12:18:09 <lufimtse>	also had a quick glance at this guy:
Jan 19 12:18:10 <lufimtse>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=525305
Jan 19 12:18:21 <lufimtse>	linux side is lacking
Jan 19 12:18:27 <lufimtse>	adding support is like 3 lines of code
Jan 19 12:18:33 <lufimtse>	low-hanging fruit.
Jan 19 12:18:47 <akurtakov>	ok
Jan 19 12:19:14 <lufimtse>	did you have chance to review make_linux patch?
Jan 19 12:19:43 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: no, it's on hold as there are more pressing M5 things
Jan 19 12:19:56 <akurtakov>	http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/I20180119-0110/
Jan 19 12:20:01 <akurtakov>	not best state of affairs 
Jan 19 12:23:15 <lufimtse>	ok, I'll followup on make_linux afterwar M5
Jan 19 12:23:30 <lufimtse>	I'll verify launcher on RHEL7 today then
Jan 19 12:25:24 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: so what about OpenURL and segfault ?
Jan 19 12:26:07 <lufimtse>	Ok plan: 1) OpenUrl (30 mins?)   2) Verify launcher on RHEL        3) Segfault
Jan 19 12:26:09 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Jan 19 12:26:24 <lufimtse>	the segfault thing is a bit of nieche case I think btw,,
Jan 19 12:26:41 <lufimtse>	because it only happens when you use the '--...' param, 
Jan 19 12:26:51 <lufimtse>	which seems like most people would not use
Jan 19 12:27:12 <lufimtse>	like it's important to fix, but if there is something more pressing, maybe work on that
Jan 19 12:27:19 <lufimtse>	wdyt?
Jan 19 12:27:20 <lufimtse>	idk
Jan 19 12:27:41 <lufimtse>	like 'eclipse /file' works in all situations
Jan 19 12:27:43 <lufimtse>	relative or abs
Jan 19 12:38:46 <akurtakov>	crash is crash :)
Jan 19 12:39:01 <lufimtse>	ah, so crashes always take priority?
Jan 19 12:39:08 <akurtakov>	IMHO yes
Jan 19 12:39:11 <akurtakov>	 :)
Jan 19 12:39:21 <lufimtse>	even if like 0.01% of users experience it?
Jan 19 12:39:34 <lufimtse>	0.0001%
Jan 19 12:39:37 <lufimtse>	^ Guess
Jan 19 12:41:28 <akurtakov>	IMHO yes
Jan 19 12:41:43 <akurtakov>	we should never crash
Jan 19 12:41:58 <lufimtse>	ok
Jan 19 12:42:30 <lufimtse>	Well, done with the OpenUrl thing (needs user feedback), so I guess off to verify launcher on RHEL. (20 mins probably).
Jan 19 12:42:33 <lufimtse>	then segfault fixing.
Jan 19 12:49:48 <lufimtse>	Btw, 
Jan 19 12:50:11 <lufimtse>	Is it still worth adding the swt.dbus.init jvm flag to *.product?
Jan 19 12:50:31 <lufimtse>	from what I gather, the OpenDocument is intended for use with launcher
Jan 19 12:50:37 <lufimtse>	and the flag is hard-coded into launcher
Jan 19 12:51:14 <lufimtse>	Like, in which other use case would people use OpenDocument other than with launcher?
Jan 19 13:09:07 <ericwill>	https://twitter.com/vogella/status/954240560424013824
Jan 19 13:09:12 <ericwill>	this is a pretty nice looking SWT app
Jan 19 13:14:50 <lufimtse>	nice
Jan 19 13:15:14 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, btw, launcher verified on RHEL7.4, Fedora27/wayland, Gtk2/3. All good.
Jan 19 13:15:22 <akurtakov>	perfect
Jan 19 14:29:00 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hey.
Jan 19 14:29:06 <lufimtse>	SegFault fix is pretty trivial: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/115725/
Jan 19 14:30:54 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: have you tried whether the crash happens on mac/win too?
Jan 19 14:31:04 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hey
Jan 19 14:31:10 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, just had network issues
Jan 19 14:31:29 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, good point, let me test on win/mac. Give me 5 mins.
Jan 19 14:39:52 <ericwill>	akurtakov you around? I have a procedure question for milestone week
Jan 19 14:40:04 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ask
Jan 19 14:41:34 <ericwill>	akurtakov so a bunch of fixes I did for M5 got backported, so now they have the "target milestone" set to 4.7.3 in BZ
Jan 19 14:41:46 <ericwill>	should I verify these fixes next week? or during the 4.7.3 RC1?
Jan 19 14:41:52 <ericwill>	or both?
Jan 19 14:43:11 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I don't care about the verifications
Jan 19 14:43:24 <akurtakov>	other than keeping the process happy
Jan 19 14:43:34 <akurtakov>	aka buy some good will from IBM
Jan 19 14:43:52 <akurtakov>	we still need it
Jan 19 14:43:53 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, segFaults on Mac's, 
Jan 19 14:44:01 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay
Jan 19 14:44:06 <akurtakov>	so answer it - unless ask ignore it
Jan 19 14:44:12 <akurtakov>	unless asked :)
Jan 19 14:44:25 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I'll post comment in patch
Jan 19 14:45:24 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: do you have win to try ?
Jan 19 14:50:07 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, yes, crashes on win with relative path also
Jan 19 14:50:28 <akurtakov>	ok, that should give us good reason to request full rebuild
Jan 19 14:51:15 <lufimtse>	I see
Jan 19 14:51:28 <lufimtse>	I thoughts builds were starting next week or something
Jan 19 14:52:48 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmm. Looking for work to do. You remember the 'add swt.dbus.init jvm dbus flag to *.product' files. Is that something we should still pursue given that we've hard-coded into the launcher?
Jan 19 14:53:04 <lufimtse>	afak the launcher is the only use case for OpenDocument?
Jan 19 14:53:14 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: we shoudl still do it
Jan 19 14:53:29 <akurtakov>	for people launching with java -jar launcher.jar
Jan 19 14:54:37 <lufimtse>	What's the use case of 'java -jar launcher.jar'
Jan 19 14:54:54 <lufimtse>	like people who use 'java -jar launcher.jar', would they still use the launcher?
Jan 19 14:55:43 <lufimtse>	like people doing 'java -jar launcher' would then only be able to open files through a launcher or via gdbus
Jan 19 14:55:57 <lufimtse>	it's kinda a strange use case?
Jan 19 14:56:26 <lufimtse>	Or are you thinking of launching a child eclipse and use the launcher to open files in child eclipse?
Jan 19 14:56:54 <lufimtse>	not sure how useful that would be?
Jan 19 14:56:58 <lufimtse>	wdyt?
Jan 19 14:58:18 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: it's a mixed issue
Jan 19 14:58:47 <akurtakov>	people launching with java -jar can not use openFile command AFAIK
Jan 19 14:59:11 <akurtakov>	but at the same time I want people launching that way to have the dbus end point inited
Jan 19 14:59:45 <akurtakov>	for future usage when this dbus point will be used for other purposes too
Jan 19 15:00:02 *	akurtakov things of e.g. firefox extension, nautilus  and etc.
Jan 19 15:05:05 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmmm. I would think that such extensions would just run the launcher, but idk. Well, any ideas on how to find the relevant *.product files that I should add the linux arg to? (Should I check revision history of who added the XStartOnFirst thread and look for other *.product files?)
Jan 19 15:05:25 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: such extension will not use the launcher
Jan 19 15:05:31 <akurtakov>	it will call via dbus
Jan 19 15:05:57 <akurtakov>	checking the XStartOnFirst is one way
Jan 19 15:06:22 <akurtakov>	the way I would have started is via http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/I20180119-0110/ 
Jan 19 15:06:42 <akurtakov>	looking at deliverables and locating their products
Jan 19 15:06:54 <lufimtse>	what is deliverables?
Jan 19 15:07:11 <akurtakov>	tarballs with launcher in it
Jan 19 15:07:26 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: btw, can you deliver any swt bugfix by monday?
Jan 19 15:07:42 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, depends on the bug to fix
Jan 19 15:07:46 <akurtakov>	that would have higher value
Jan 19 15:07:51 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ANY :)
Jan 19 15:08:04 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Jan 19 15:08:09 <lufimtse>	*maybe*
Jan 19 15:08:22 <lufimtse>	I haven't fixed an SWT bug in like over a year.
Jan 19 15:08:26 <lufimtse>	ha ha
Jan 19 15:08:36 <lufimtse>	just been webkit and launcher stuff.
Jan 19 15:08:49 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&classification=Eclipse&component=SWT&known_name=swt%2Fgtk&list_id=17157968&op_sys=Linux&op_sys=Linux-GTK&product=Platform&query_based_on=swt%2Fgtk&query_format=advanced
Jan 19 15:08:51 <akurtakov>	:)
Jan 19 15:09:26 <akurtakov>	monday EOD is end of development for M5
Jan 19 15:09:42 <akurtakov>	so the more we can get in the better
Jan 19 15:09:50 <lufimtse>	Maybe, depending on which bug I'd work on.
Jan 19 15:10:06 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: pick the easiest you think of 
Jan 19 15:10:26 <lufimtse>	what's the importance of having some bugfix added?
Jan 19 15:10:27 <akurtakov>	I really speak on quantity here 
Jan 19 15:10:45 <lufimtse>	I'm kinda thinking work on most pressing issue
Jan 19 15:10:50 <akurtakov>	we don't have time for anything big
Jan 19 15:11:05 <akurtakov>	so I look for biggest amount of small things 
Jan 19 15:11:28 <lufimtse>	Do you want to reduce the overall bugcount?
Jan 19 15:11:38 <akurtakov>	no
Jan 19 15:11:58 <akurtakov>	I want some of the real bugs to be fixed
Jan 19 15:12:13 *	akurtakov wouldn't mind reducing the bugcount but was speaking for smth else
Jan 19 15:12:30 <akurtakov>	preferably gtk3 specific bugs
Jan 19 15:13:09 <ericwill>	akurtakov many of the bugs open aren't easy fixes anymore :)
Jan 19 15:13:41 <lufimtse>	Hmmm.
Jan 19 15:13:44 <akurtakov>	ericwill: on every triage couple of hours I spend I find at least one such :)
Jan 19 15:13:44 <lufimtse>	I'm thinking...
Jan 19 15:14:02 <lufimtse>	I'm thinking I'm kinda hungry, haven't had lunch yet and it's 3pm. I should go get food :-)
Jan 19 15:14:24 <lufimtse>	if you find something, feel free to send it my way. Otherwise I'll hunt around for something.
Jan 19 15:14:26 <ericwill>	lufimtse maybe this one? https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=529126
Jan 19 15:14:37 <lufimtse>	Trees, brrr
Jan 19 15:15:09 <lufimtse>	maybe investigate show stopper for gtk3
Jan 19 15:15:10 <lufimtse>	489640 – (gtk3SlowCombobox) [GTK3] setting a lot of items to combobox is extremely slow
Jan 19 15:15:10 <lufimtse>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=489640
Jan 19 15:16:17 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: you think you can figure it by monday ?
Jan 19 15:51:04 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, no but I can try :-)

Jan 23 11:48:06 <akurtakov>	please verify the crash is fixed on all OSs with it

Jan 24 11:43:31 <ericwill>	akurtakov what do you think of the new meeting structure?
Jan 24 11:53:41 <akurtakov>	ericwill: it matches your request for dedicated meetings
Jan 24 11:54:01 <akurtakov>	and there is no size fits them all solution
Jan 24 11:54:10 <akurtakov>	it doesn't make a lot of sense for releng guys
Jan 24 11:54:22 <akurtakov>	but it totally makes for LSP and SWT stuff
Jan 24 11:54:37 <akurtakov>	as everything - it's worth trying
Jan 24 11:54:47 <akurtakov>	if it's not best solution we can always change 
Jan 24 11:55:04 <ericwill>	akurtakov agreed on all counts :)
Jan 26 10:48:43 <akurtakov>	guys do you have pending patches for review?
Jan 26 10:54:10 <ericwill>	not today
Jan 26 10:55:02 <akurtakov>	ericwill: tough bugs, right?
Jan 26 10:55:18 <ericwill>	akurtakov yes
Jan 26 10:55:22 <ericwill>	menu is a weird widget
Jan 26 10:57:28 <akurtakov>	ericwill: weird how ?
Jan 26 10:58:08 <ericwill>	akurtakov there are multiple ways to attach a menu to a widget
Jan 26 10:58:20 <ericwill>	but in the end none of them matter because we pop-up menus where the mouse pointer is
Jan 26 10:58:33 <ericwill>	so setLocation/showMenu etc. don't really do anything
Jan 26 10:58:57 <akurtakov>	are they specified in Menu or in parent(s)
Jan 26 10:59:25 <ericwill>	both, setLocation is in Menu but showMenu/setMenu is in Control
Jan 26 10:59:56 <ericwill>	akurtakov I'm testing a fix for the show in/open with bug you found on Wayland: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/116068/
Jan 26 11:01:33 <akurtakov>	I see
Jan 26 11:01:43 <akurtakov>	in this case setLocation implementation is wrong
Jan 26 11:01:57 <akurtakov>	does it behave in the same way under Mac/Win?
Jan 26 11:02:05 <akurtakov>	aka location is not used at all?
Jan 26 11:02:31 <ericwill>	I have to look into it more
Jan 26 11:02:47 <ericwill>	right now I am working on the X11 bug with the right click menus being popped up in the wrong place
Jan 26 11:02:55 <ericwill>	the one we have a Red Hat BZ ticket for
Jan 26 11:03:22 <akurtakov>	I see
Jan 26 11:03:35 <akurtakov>	so what is going on in this case?
Jan 26 11:03:46 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: btw, wha do you work on ?
Jan 26 11:05:49 <ericwill>	akurtakov it's a bit of a mystery. all the button click coordinates are correct, and the correct coordinates are fed to GTK, but then GTK pops the menu up in the wrong spot
Jan 26 11:06:08 <ericwill>	I even connected to the "popped-up" signal and GTK prints that the menu was popped up in the wrong place
Jan 26 11:06:20 <ericwill>	I have a few options I am going to explore though
Jan 26 11:06:26 <akurtakov>	ericwill: like?
Jan 26 11:06:47 <ericwill>	using gtk_menu_popup_at_widget()
Jan 26 11:09:08 <akurtakov>	ericwill: you have read https://blog.gtk.org/2016/07/15/future-of-relative-window-positioning/ right?
Jan 26 11:10:40 <ericwill>	akurtakov yes
Jan 26 11:10:46 <ericwill>	akurtakov I also commented on this bug: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=791845
Jan 26 11:10:56 <ericwill>	hopefully they will make that function API
Jan 26 11:11:00 <ericwill>	so we can make use of it
Jan 26 11:11:42 <akurtakov>	ok
Jan 26 11:37:47 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I was closing off my open gerrit stuff, verified all my patches etc.    Next: 1) Gdbus init via listeners (2 hours).   2) Update GLib.java (4 hours).  3) <not too sure>. Maybe finish off what's assigned to me or start on bugfixes. Either pick on the 'gtk3 show stoppers' or other gtk3 bugs. (Do you have anyhting in mind?).  <<< wdyt
Jan 26 11:38:24 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: finished assigned stuff
Jan 26 11:38:45 <akurtakov>	what happened with your tree performance work you did this wek?
Jan 26 11:39:03 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, by 'finished', you mean 'finish*' <<<
Jan 26 11:39:10 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what tree performance? You mean combobox?
Jan 26 11:39:14 <akurtakov>	ah yes
Jan 26 11:40:28 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I started on it. Next step was to profile gtk function (gtkcomboboxtext.c). Jeff gave me some advise on how I can do that, this would be my next step. 
Jan 26 11:40:59 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I need to see if it triggers any strange signals, or figure out what's causing the slowdown at the deeper level.
Jan 26 14:13:09 <ericwill>	akurtakov you check your mail quickly :) yeah I found a fix using the new GtkMenu API
Jan 26 14:13:12 <ericwill>	current in testing
Jan 26 14:13:15 <ericwill>	*currently
Jan 26 15:25:15 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: for the dynamic dbus init
Jan 26 15:25:20 <akurtakov>	if you are confident push :)
Jan 26 15:25:28 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok.

Feb 12 14:53:57 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ so good news and bad news
Feb 12 14:54:05 <ericwill>	good news: I fixed the Control.print() bug
Feb 12 14:54:15 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: nice :)
Feb 12 14:54:18 <ericwill>	bad news: I spoke with the GTK guys about the setRegion() business and they said it's WONTFIX
Feb 12 14:55:05 <ericwill>	I have some ideas for workarounds, but nothing super promising
Feb 12 14:55:32 <akurtakov_>	huh
Feb 12 14:55:42 <akurtakov_>	have they offered workaround ?
Feb 12 14:55:58 <akurtakov_>	why is it wontfix
Feb 12 14:56:04 <akurtakov_>	is it explained somewhere
Feb 12 14:57:23 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: ^
Feb 12 14:57:36 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ I spoke with Benjamin on IRC about it
Feb 12 14:57:48 <ericwill>	he said the bug stems from the changes to the drawing model in GTK3.10 and they will not be changing it
Feb 12 14:58:11 <ericwill>	he said the closest workaround he could think of is to clip the cairo region in gtk_draw()
Feb 12 14:58:20 <akurtakov_>	will that work ?
Feb 12 14:58:32 <ericwill>	probably, I haven't tried it yet
Feb 12 14:58:39 <ericwill>	it doesn't block the input though
Feb 12 14:58:51 <ericwill>	i.e. for a button
Feb 12 14:59:09 <akurtakov_>	so this is that every widget receives just its own cairo to draw on ?
Feb 12 14:59:48 <ericwill>	what do you mean?
Feb 12 15:00:47 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: " the changes to the drawing model in GTK3.10" and I am looking for clarification what these are 
Feb 12 15:01:29 <ericwill>	ah
Feb 12 15:01:31 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ https://github.com/GNOME/gtk/commit/d22fd7223c75f4720ddb982c659efb0d8d7543c4
Feb 12 15:02:58 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: I am not sure I understood it from this explanation :)
Feb 12 15:03:08 <akurtakov_>	so you're going to look into clipping ?
Feb 12 15:03:13 <ericwill>	<Company> ericwill: because shaping is only supported on toplevels (read: native) windows these days
Feb 12 15:03:13 <ericwill>	<Company> ericwill: everything else should be done manually
Feb 12 15:03:13 <ericwill>	<ericwill> Company can you expand on the "done manually" part
Feb 12 15:03:13 <ericwill>	<Company> ericwill: using a parent widget that cairo_clip()s
Feb 12 15:03:26 <ericwill>	<Company> ericwill: if it's about drawing, I'd suggest making the container's draw function cairo_clip() the region before drawing the children
Feb 12 15:03:39 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ yes, not sure if I'll do it now or later
Feb 12 15:03:45 <ericwill>	depends on how the table stuff goes
Feb 12 15:04:25 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: ok
Feb 12 15:04:49 <akurtakov_>	at least this should be step ahead for egit bug, righ?
Feb 12 15:05:10 <ericwill>	yes, I merged the fix for Control.print()
Feb 12 15:05:30 <ericwill>	the second part of the fix is harder as we have all these cases to deal with, but once that's in it's fixed
Feb 12 15:06:07 <akurtakov_>	good
Feb 13 16:29:17 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ I added you as a reviewer for the EGit patch
Feb 13 16:29:34 <ericwill>	and Leo has a fix for the method refactor/TabFolder bug
Feb 14 11:38:03 <akurtakov_>	hey guys
Feb 14 12:07:36 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: hey good work on the tree bug
Feb 14 12:07:58 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: do you expect other tree/table bugs to be fixed by this work?
Feb 14 12:17:23 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ 
Feb 14 12:17:25 <ericwill>	thanks
Feb 14 12:17:31 <ericwill>	so far this one: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=529563#c5
Feb 14 12:17:36 <ericwill>	waiting to hear back from Thomas
Feb 14 12:18:15 <akurtakov_>	good
Feb 14 12:22:53 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=493513 same issue ?
Feb 14 12:23:29 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ looks like it
Feb 14 12:23:50 <ericwill>	I'll close as dupo
Feb 14 12:23:51 <ericwill>	*dup
Feb 14 12:23:55 <akurtakov_>	cool
Feb 14 12:28:12 <akurtakov_>	ericwill|lunch: btw bug 476441 
Feb 14 12:28:18 <akurtakov_>	it's some misplacement again
Feb 14 12:44:02 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ yes, added it to the tree tracking bug
Feb 14 12:44:17 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: so what's next in your basket ?
Feb 14 12:44:18 <akurtakov_>	:)
Feb 14 12:45:12 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ review Leo's tabfolder patch, try out some workarounds for the setRegion bug, and then probably work through some of those tree bugs that Thomas filed
Feb 14 12:45:42 <ericwill>	I see this one in the IDE a lot: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=531048
Feb 14 12:45:48 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: nice, the setRegion would be nice
Feb 14 12:46:59 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ okay sounds good

Feb 15 10:15:31 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: that's unfortunate
Feb 15 10:15:44 <akurtakov_>	it's always tough to debug until finding a simpler repro
Feb 15 10:16:24 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ I've tried :)
Feb 15 10:44:28 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ you want me to comment in the RH BZ ticket about the photon release right?
Feb 15 10:44:32 <ericwill>	or upstream
Feb 15 10:45:08 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: RHBZ
Feb 15 10:45:16 <ericwill>	kk
Feb 15 10:45:18 <akurtakov_>	and I know we speak of many things
Feb 15 10:45:28 <akurtakov_>	do you have a snippet to test this one ?6
Feb 15 10:45:33 <akurtakov_>	M6
Feb 15 10:45:38 <akurtakov_>	as it's in our internal Bz
Feb 15 10:46:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ no I don't have a snippet
Feb 15 10:48:57 <akurtakov_>	sorry for the snippet it was paste by mistake

Feb 15 11:38:26 <lufimtse>	was gonna look into this guy: [GTK] Add Callback constructor for custom method signatures 
Feb 15 11:38:32 <lufimtse>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=510538
Feb 15 11:38:36 <lufimtse>	related to Ian
Feb 15 11:38:39 <lufimtse>	Ian's guesture patch
Feb 15 11:39:07 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: what about the gtk3 bugs ?
Feb 15 11:39:30 <akurtakov_>	I can see how some of these could be few hours break though :)
Feb 15 11:39:49 <akurtakov_>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=516839
Feb 15 11:40:20 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: another duplicate https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=493213 ?
Feb 15 11:40:50 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, Was thinking of finishing off the callback thing and then fix some tree bugs 
Feb 15 11:40:54 <lufimtse>	wdyt?
Feb 15 11:41:13 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ yes, I'll close it as dup
Feb 15 11:41:15 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: ok, if you have clear use case/test case for the callback
Feb 15 11:41:31 <akurtakov_>	and assuming it's not gonna be more than a few days
Feb 15 11:41:53 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, yea, I hope to clear it out quickly
Feb 15 11:42:30 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, is there any particular gtk3 bug that bugs you, or should I shop around?
Feb 15 11:42:42 <lufimtse>	I was thinking either Tree bugs, or work on the tracker ha ha.
Feb 15 11:43:20 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=531048 
Feb 15 11:43:28 <akurtakov_>	as I think it has multiple duplicates
Feb 15 11:43:40 <akurtakov_>	and is probably the reason for blurry text from time to time in eclipse
Feb 15 11:44:29 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, ok
Feb 15 11:45:04 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: the gdk/gtk warnings on the console are worth fixing as they manifest in other bugs at some point for sure
Feb 15 11:46:05 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, ok, that's also a good thing to work on. 
Feb 15 11:56:10 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: lufimtse: please talk and one of you should pick the context menu misplacement with highest prio
Feb 15 11:56:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ I'm on it
Feb 15 11:56:31 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: ok, please keep me in the loop
Feb 15 11:56:39 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ Andrey has annoyed me sufficiently that I am going to fix it to spite him :)
Feb 15 11:56:56 <akurtakov_>	ericwill: well, note that is on my request
Feb 15 11:57:06 <akurtakov_>	the rhbz /customer case
Feb 15 11:57:27 <akurtakov_>	we need these to prove the importance of SWT work
Feb 15 11:57:34 <akurtakov_>	but we have to be faster with delivery too
Feb 15 11:58:17 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ I know

Feb 15 11:59:00 <ericwill>	akurtakov_ I'll keep you in the loop
Feb 15 11:59:14 <akurtakov_>	ok
Feb 15 13:13:33 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: please open Bug510803_TabFolder_Table_inPlaceEditing
Feb 15 13:13:43 <lufimtse>	hey
Feb 15 13:14:10 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: see the warnings there :)
Feb 15 13:14:29 <lufimtse>	no warnings shown for me ?
Feb 15 13:15:34 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: did you override the settings
Feb 15 13:15:45 <lufimtse>	I think the project is set to override them
Feb 15 13:15:49 <lufimtse>	not sure why
Feb 15 13:15:50 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, 
Feb 15 13:16:17 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: the project is supposed to ship its warnings so we all see same warnings
Feb 15 13:17:02 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, so I don't see warnings, i'm not sure how to procceed
Feb 15 13:17:04 <lufimtse>	wdyt?
Feb 15 13:17:36 <lufimtse>	you mean warnings when running or warnings at static analysis?
Feb 15 13:20:01 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: doh, gone after pull
Feb 15 13:20:11 <lufimtse>	yay
Feb 15 13:20:15 <akurtakov_>	I was at gerrit review 
Feb 15 13:20:36 <akurtakov_>	sorry
Feb 15 13:21:00 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW5oGRx9CLM
Feb 15 13:21:16 <lufimtse>	X-D
Feb 15 14:03:28 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: so is https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=287580 fixed now too
Feb 15 14:03:39 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, checking..
Feb 15 14:05:17 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, ah, I should have investigated "blocks 287580", I missed that. Made a note to check in on dependants when I fix bugs. Investigating...
Feb 15 14:12:59 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, well, idk what Markus meant with "'Ctrl' to toggle overwrite mode" but the shift+enter / alt+enter issues have been fixed in the mean time.
Feb 15 14:13:18 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: when you complete
Feb 15 14:13:44 <akurtakov>	if you have ctrl pressed it overwrites instead of appends
Feb 15 14:14:17 <akurtakov>	ask on the bug if unclear
Feb 15 14:14:26 <lufimtse>	I see
Feb 15 14:16:52 <lufimtse>	I gather the feature isn't implemented yet.
Feb 15 14:16:58 <lufimtse>	doens't work on mac
Feb 15 14:17:02 <lufimtse>	or linux.
Feb 15 14:17:14 <lufimtse>	I wonder what's the use case for the overwrite business
Feb 15 14:17:22 <akurtakov>	but works on Win ?
Feb 15 14:18:08 <akurtakov>	IMHO override should be default always :)
Feb 15 14:19:10 <lufimtse>	haven't tested on win
Feb 15 14:36:31 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: some questions on one of the black background bugs if you have a bit of time..
Feb 15 14:36:51 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, sup
Feb 15 14:38:04 <rgrunber>	so Noopur responded about the refactor 'tooltip'. On Windows it looks like this.. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=272642 . In fact it's pretty much the same situation on Linux as well. The 'tooltip' background is a lighter gray and looks weird with the style text having a darker background.
Feb 15 14:39:05 <rgrunber>	to me this seems more like a theming issue than something to fix specifically for the dialog.. i did try setting the bg for the 'tooltip' itself to match but it always stays that same shade of grey.
Feb 15 14:39:46 <rgrunber>	* this is with the patch to use INFORMATION applied.
Feb 15 14:42:02 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, can the TEXT "Press Enter to refactor" be configured not to have it's own background?
Feb 15 14:42:34 <lufimtse>	to make it have a uniform background
Feb 15 14:43:00 <lufimtse>	Or adjust the rest of the dialogue to have same background as the "Press enter to repactor" control.
Feb 15 14:43:37 <lufimtse>	Ideally, the popup should be fully colored as per color assigned to "INFORMATION_BACKGROUND" by user.
Feb 15 14:44:18 <lufimtse>	It's possible that there's a control that doesn't have it's color set, which you might have to add.
Feb 15 14:44:21 <lufimtse>	wdyt?
Feb 15 14:48:18 <rgrunber>	i've tried setting the bg to make it the same but didn't seem to change. might need to fiddle with it some more. if i don't set a background on the actual style text it just becomes white.
Feb 15 14:48:50 <lufimtse>	you might have to style the whole sheell
Feb 15 14:48:51 <lufimtse>	shell
Feb 15 14:49:04 <lufimtse>	white like the Text widget becomes white background in dark theme?
Feb 15 14:52:01 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: yeah, if i remove the call to set its background.
Feb 15 14:52:20 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, then you porbably need to style the whole dialogue 
Feb 15 14:52:27 <rgrunber>	basically the widget recursively sets the background for the shell, style text, link, and toolbar item.
Feb 15 14:52:30 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, try styling the shell that the dialogue appears in.
Feb 15 14:52:48 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, or why is the background colors different
Feb 15 14:52:51 <lufimtse>	one light one dark
Feb 15 14:52:56 <lufimtse>	why aren't they the same I wonder
Feb 15 14:52:59 <lufimtse>	maybe something mixes them
Feb 15 14:53:03 <lufimtse>	blends colors
Feb 15 14:53:23 <lufimtse>	or the selected dark theme color of INFORMATION is too dark?
Feb 15 14:53:59 <rgrunber>	well yeah, it looks that way. fwiw i see the colour of the actual shell in many other areas on the dark theme
Feb 15 14:55:00 <rgrunber>	toolbar items for example are a light gray.. like the text background in that tooltip popup.. and when you hover over them they become a darker colour.. more like the background of the styled text.
Feb 15 15:06:54 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, hmmm. I wonder if it makes sense to make INFORMATION color lighter by default. Would that break anything?
Feb 15 15:07:09 <lufimtse>	like make it light black
Feb 15 15:07:34 <lufimtse>	I recall having issues with the light/dark black in the past as well
Feb 15 15:08:27 <rgrunber>	the other thing is afaict the shell, styled text, link, and toolbar item are all getting set to the same background, but something might override it ?
Feb 15 15:09:12 <rgrunber>	seems like for a shell the setbackground is more of a hint..
Feb 15 16:19:14 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: is it possible to change a widget foreground/background if it has already been defined in a theme .css ?.. or will that always override it..
Feb 15 16:20:34 <lufimtse>	hmm
Feb 15 16:21:04 <lufimtse>	I think it's possible. E.g a user color can override a system/theme color. E.g try setting javadoc color in dark theme.
Feb 15 16:25:01 <rgrunber>	ah, good point, but then why do some colours say something like 'styled in css cannot be overriden'
Feb 15 16:25:04 <rgrunber>	special property ?
Feb 15 16:25:17 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Feb 15 16:25:18 <lufimtse>	idk
Feb 15 16:25:38 <lufimtse>	I know that I once fixed the css to style the heap status bar
Feb 15 16:25:45 <lufimtse>	colors
Feb 15 16:25:49 <lufimtse>	in dark theme
Feb 15 16:26:01 <lufimtse>	in the css you kinda specify a widget type 
Feb 15 16:26:12 <lufimtse>	like java class of sort
Feb 15 16:26:40 <rgrunber>	basically i found a giant block that styles most (if not all) Shells as the light grey seen on the dark theme.
Feb 15 16:26:52 <rgrunber>	81,86,88 (#515658)
Feb 15 16:27:04 <lufimtse>	option 1: set INFORMATION to be like light
Feb 15 16:27:22 <lufimtse>	option 2: set the block that styled shells to be like INFORMATION
Feb 15 16:27:26 <rgrunber>	well if we change INFORMATION we'd have to go back and see if it breaks something..
Feb 15 16:27:33 <lufimtse>	uh ha
Feb 15 16:27:44 <rgrunber>	 /pain
Feb 15 16:27:53 <lufimtse>	 /welcome to swt
Feb 15 16:28:55 <rgrunber>	easiest solution would be to just make the styledtext the same colour as the shell (81,86,88) but i don't think the colour is referenced as a constant anywhere in java code..
Feb 15 16:29:37 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Feb 15 16:29:47 <lufimtse>	I think INFORMATION is based on a system color
Feb 15 16:30:09 <lufimtse>	COLOR_LIST_BACKGROUND
Feb 15 16:30:20 <lufimtse>	on gtk
Feb 15 16:30:30 <lufimtse>	and COLOR_TOOLTIP_INFO on cocoa/win
Feb 15 16:30:37 <lufimtse>	so we can't really change that.
Feb 15 16:30:49 <lufimtse>	option 2: can we change the light color to be a bit darker?
Feb 15 16:30:55 <lufimtse>	how would the dark eclipse look like?
Feb 15 16:31:01 <rgrunber>	org.eclipse.ui.workbench.INFORMATION_BACKGROUND=52,57,61' (for dark theme ss)
Feb 15 16:31:04 <rgrunber>	*css
Feb 15 16:31:19 <lufimtse>	ah
Feb 15 16:31:28 <lufimtse>	INFORMATION_ is set on dark theme
Feb 15 16:31:34 <lufimtse>	but is system color on classic theme
Feb 15 16:31:36 <lufimtse>	forgot
Feb 15 16:31:47 <lufimtse>	try to set it to 81,... 
Feb 15 16:31:49 <lufimtse>	see what happens
Feb 15 16:31:59 <lufimtse>	check javadoc and places that use it like the debug expression viewer etc..
Feb 15 16:32:05 <lufimtse>	probably easiest solution
Feb 15 16:32:19 <lufimtse>	and will probably fix other such strange dark/light black issues.
Feb 15 16:33:10 <rgrunber>	i could check that.. looks like information is based off of CONTENT_ASSIST_BACKGROUND/FOREGROUND_COLOR

Feb 16 10:18:31 *	Now talking on #SWT
Feb 16 10:19:11 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I tinkered around with min-height business. Maybe in his theme the min-height is set to something like 50px
Feb 16 10:19:57 <ericwill>	lufimtse min-height does not enforce a maximum, if we wants to have 50px entries he can have them
Feb 16 10:20:20 <lufimtse>	Kinda it does enforce a minimum thou
Feb 16 10:20:28 <lufimtse>	I think his point is that we screw with the toolbar and entries
Feb 16 10:20:37 <lufimtse>	breaking other themes
Feb 16 10:20:50 <lufimtse>	which is kinda valid if you think about it
Feb 16 10:21:26 <lufimtse>	we could add some "if adwaita" then screw with toolbars/buttons
Feb 16 10:21:30 <lufimtse>	then other themes wouldn't break.
Feb 16 10:21:36 <lufimtse>	I.e, his point is the inverse
Feb 16 10:21:46 <lufimtse>	not add support for other themes, but don't screw with other themes
Feb 16 10:22:05 <lufimtse>	which is fair imho?
Feb 16 10:22:14 <lufimtse>	*assuming our css breaks his theme.
Feb 16 10:22:29 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's easy now when it's a binary: adwaita vs. Andrey's theme
Feb 16 10:22:48 <ericwill>	it will become impossible to maintain when every person wants their theme to have checks like "if adwaita"
Feb 16 10:22:54 <lufimtse>	thinkkkk about...
Feb 16 10:22:59 <lufimtse>	I was thinking the same
Feb 16 10:23:05 <lufimtse>	let's talk about it on monday
Feb 16 10:23:14 <ericwill>	lufimtse *Tuesday :P
Feb 16 10:23:19 <lufimtse>	Tuesday :P
Feb 16 10:23:43 <lufimtse>	point being we're actually doing a 'if adwaitda', make toolbars smaller and entires bigger
Feb 16 10:23:55 <lufimtse>	we just don't label it as 'adwaita'
Feb 16 10:24:00 <lufimtse>	but do so anyway
Feb 16 10:24:20 <lufimtse>	looking at his screenshot, he complains toolbars being too small and entries too big.
Feb 16 10:24:32 <lufimtse>	I think we missunderstood him all along there
Feb 16 10:24:52 <lufimtse>	let's think about it on tuesday
Feb 16 10:24:59 <lufimtse>	can't think of a good solution right now 
Feb 16 10:25:22 <ericwill>	lufimtse his screenshot is because his theme is broken
Feb 16 10:25:25 <ericwill>	look at the entries
Feb 16 10:25:30 <ericwill>	they are way larger than 26px
Feb 16 10:25:51 <lufimtse>	I have a theory that our min-entries-size:26px might be the offender
Feb 16 10:26:07 <lufimtse>	we'll have to test with him.
Feb 16 10:26:16 <ericwill>	akurtakov thoughts
Feb 16 10:26:43 <lufimtse>	I think it pretty easy to proov if we make a version of swt without the css changes
Feb 16 10:26:47 <lufimtse>	prove*
Feb 16 10:27:06 <lufimtse>	if that doesn't change anything for him, then his theme is broken.
Feb 16 10:28:12 <ericwill>	lufimtse even if our stuff breaks his thing I'm not so sure we should remove it
Feb 16 10:28:19 <lufimtse>	not remove it
Feb 16 10:28:33 <lufimtse>	but think about how to solve ti.
Feb 16 10:28:43 <ericwill>	kk
Feb 16 10:28:50 <lufimtse>	we shouldn't break other people's themes, or at least allow other themes to override our hard-coded stuff.
Feb 16 10:47:05 <akurtakov>	ericwill: lufimtse: without a proof the css breaks anything I would say don't touch it now
Feb 16 10:48:40 <akurtakov>	fwiw, many apps use such app specific css to override defaults
Feb 16 10:49:47 <akurtakov>	e.g. https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/polari/blob/master/data/resources/application.css
Feb 16 10:50:17 <akurtakov>	I admit they assign their own classes to widgets but the end effect is the same
Feb 16 10:50:36 <akurtakov>	it's not different than gtk2 where some sizes are hardcoded in the java code
Feb 16 10:51:02 <akurtakov>	if there is a problem let's speak for concrete problem
Feb 16 10:52:43 <akurtakov>	e.g. http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse%20SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/ToolItem.java#n317
Feb 16 10:52:52 <akurtakov>	seriously where is this 23 coming from
Feb 16 10:53:08 <akurtakov>	and many such issues
Feb 16 10:53:20 <akurtakov>	yes, they can break with some theme
Feb 16 10:53:25 <akurtakov>	but we need proofs
Feb 16 10:54:15 <akurtakov>	hmm, are you around guys ?
Feb 16 10:55:23 <ericwill>	akurtakov yes I agree
Feb 16 10:55:56 <ericwill>	I am open to bug reports like https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=487522
Feb 16 10:57:01 <ericwill>	where the specific issue is found and I can fix it with easy testing
Feb 16 10:57:21 <akurtakov>	yup
Feb 16 10:57:33 <akurtakov>	imho the bug report in question is just vague 
Feb 16 10:57:58 <akurtakov>	thus unactionable
Feb 16 10:58:07 <ericwill>	another thing is CSS based sizing is a really tricky issue, as platform UI sets the size for widgets in the IDE
Feb 16 10:58:39 <ericwill>	if we allow for any theme to set their own min-size it will open up all sorts of corner case bug reports that will be tough to debug
Feb 16 10:59:08 <akurtakov>	well people can still deploy their own css if they want as system property
Feb 16 10:59:23 <akurtakov>	aka everyone can shoot himself wherever he wants :)
Feb 16 11:00:22 <lufimtse>	I think it's fairly easy to check
Feb 16 11:00:49 <lufimtse>	if Simon is interesting to test, I can submit something to check. ~10 minutes work.
Feb 16 11:00:58 <lufimtse>	that would answer lots of unknowns
Feb 16 11:01:22 <akurtakov>	you mean for the min-entry-size?
Feb 16 11:03:44 <lufimtse>	both toolbar and entry size.
Feb 16 11:03:59 <lufimtse>	I think the easiest thing is to simply test and gathre facts
Feb 16 11:04:04 <lufimtse>	atm we're in opinion land
Feb 16 11:04:34 <lufimtse>	Let's wait for Simon's reply and go from there.
Feb 16 11:04:50 <lufimtse>	or discuss on next meeting
Feb 16 11:08:31 <akurtakov>	in case there is no info from Simeon there is nothing to discuss :)
Feb 16 11:15:26 <ericwill>	I think their entry issue is the same as: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=487522#c10
Feb 16 11:15:30 <ericwill>	but we will have to wait and see
Feb 16 11:21:49 *	akurtakov have fixed yet another padding issue http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/commit/?id=158c894de7520ed72b3f64017da7ce0ea24ead54
Feb 16 11:22:02 <akurtakov>	found by lufimtse :)
Feb 16 11:22:41 <lufimtse>	akurtakov++
Feb 16 11:23:06 <akurtakov>	I am pretty sure that paddings are not calculated proper in many places
Feb 16 11:23:25 <akurtakov>	as they started to appear after the move to css
Feb 16 11:24:22 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, how did you find the bug you mentioned here: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=248075  <<
Feb 16 11:24:27 <lufimtse>	did you use a datetime control somewhere?
Feb 16 11:24:53 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: noticed it while testing the other bug I just mentioned
Feb 16 11:25:02 <lufimtse>	ah
Feb 16 11:38:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=526083
Feb 16 11:38:10 <akurtakov>	btw, this is sound
Feb 16 11:39:05 <ericwill>	akurtakov what do you mean?
Feb 16 11:41:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I mean the findings fro the bounds differences
Feb 16 11:42:13 <ericwill>	akurtakov they aren't related to the menu bug from Andrey, unfortunately
Feb 16 11:42:32 <ericwill>	I am just asking the reporter of that bug why he says the allocation.x/y should be removed
Feb 16 11:48:19 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I mean on gtk2 and gtk3 we really get a diffrenece
Feb 16 11:49:02 <akurtakov>	could it be that Andrey's bug is actually multiple bugs
Feb 16 11:50:17 <ericwill>	akurtakov could be
Feb 16 11:50:36 <ericwill>	akurtakov one thing I noticed (with help from Leo) is that the menu being popped up isn't the right one
Feb 16 11:50:55 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ?
Feb 16 11:50:59 <ericwill>	i.e. if you right click only in the problems view, going from parent treeitem to the child, the menu on the first right click on the child is actually the one for the parent
Feb 16 11:52:34 <akurtakov>	hmm, mouse move not registered when click happens?
Feb 16 11:53:04 <ericwill>	maybe, this tree uses a JFace MenuManager
Feb 16 11:53:14 <ericwill>	I am still trying to figure out how it knows which menu to popup
Feb 16 11:53:33 <ericwill>	i.e. what are the steps from click -> menu popup

Feb 23 10:10:06 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, if you don't object, I'll pause treeCheese and work on this one first: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=531593
Feb 23 10:10:37 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: sure, crashes with prio
Feb 23 10:12:32 <lufimtse>	kk
Feb 23 10:14:21 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: any guesses what's going on?
Feb 23 10:16:08 <lufimtse>	hmm
Feb 23 10:40:31 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, I'm here
Feb 23 10:40:40 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay so Button.computeSize() is messing up?
Feb 23 10:40:46 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I think so
Feb 23 10:41:14 <akurtakov>	the issue seems to be in method that contains:
Feb 23 10:41:16 <akurtakov>	button.setFont(JFaceResources.getDialogFont());
Feb 23 10:41:18 <akurtakov>			PixelConverter converter = new PixelConverter(button);
Feb 23 10:41:19 <akurtakov>			int widthHint = converter.convertHorizontalDLUsToPixels(IDialogConstants.BUTTON_WIDTH);
Feb 23 10:41:21 <akurtakov>			return Math.max(widthHint, button.computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT, SWT.DEFAULT, true).x);
Feb 23 10:41:57 <ericwill>	akurtakov where is that method
Feb 23 10:42:25 <akurtakov>	ericwill: org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.SWTFactory
Feb 23 10:43:15 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay give me a sec to pull and check it out
Feb 23 10:49:37 <akurtakov>	I have to run now
Feb 23 10:49:42 <akurtakov>	will be back in ~3 h
Feb 23 10:56:00 <ericwill>	akurtakov confirmed, it's a 3.20+ button.computeSize() issue

Feb 27 13:32:53 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/PMC 
Feb 27 13:33:00 <akurtakov>	see the last topic
Feb 27 13:33:08 <akurtakov>	the burden is on you guys :)
Feb 27 13:44:23 <lufimtse>	let's see
Feb 27 13:46:18 <lufimtse>	interesting
Feb 28 09:28:55 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, morning.
Feb 28 09:29:02 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hey
Feb 28 09:29:34 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Let me pull of an akurtakov. Hey Alex, what are you working on today :-)? 
Feb 28 09:29:43 <lufimtse>	ha ha
Feb 28 09:30:00 <lufimtse>	just kidding
Feb 28 09:30:01 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: just nominated Lucas for platform committer :)
Feb 28 09:30:08 <lufimtse>	:-O
Feb 28 09:30:09 <lufimtse>	nice
Feb 28 09:30:19 <lufimtse>	lemme check mail
Feb 28 09:30:23 <akurtakov>	you're elligible to vote :)
Feb 28 09:31:13 <lufimtse>	I don't see an email about it
Feb 28 09:31:17 <lufimtse>	is it yet to come?
Feb 28 09:31:33 <akurtakov>	https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/platform-dev/msg01199.html
Feb 28 09:31:36 <akurtakov>	it's out there 
Feb 28 09:32:39 <lufimtse>	ah, never mind, it's there
Feb 28 09:32:48 <lufimtse>	will vote
Feb 28 09:33:12 <lufimtse>	I can't legally vote for a Canadian president yet (Don't have citizenship yet), but I can vote for Lucas.
Feb 28 09:33:52 <lufimtse>	I'm working on the Tree Cheese stuff. From what I gather it's caused by a workaround for another problem in 2005
Feb 28 09:34:03 <lufimtse>	so gotta fix a broken workaround
Feb 28 09:34:05 <akurtakov>	in 2005 ?
Feb 28 09:34:06 <akurtakov>	:)
Feb 28 09:34:11 <akurtakov>	is it for gtk2 only ?
Feb 28 09:34:24 <lufimtse>	I'm investigating
Feb 28 09:34:32 <lufimtse>	It might be more to be consistent with win/cocoa
Feb 28 09:34:34 <akurtakov>	if it's for gtk2 only this workaround :)
Feb 28 09:34:42 <lufimtse>	ha ha
Feb 28 09:34:46 <lufimtse>	I know what u'll say
Feb 28 09:34:49 <lufimtse>	nuke it ha ha
Feb 28 09:35:07 <akurtakov>	I'm not saying it - it comes naturally to your mind :)
Feb 28 09:35:27 <akurtakov>	one can not and should not fight nature :)
Feb 28 09:39:04 <lufimtse>	voted
Feb 28 09:39:54 <akurtakov>	perfect
Feb 28 15:05:35 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: so what's going on with the tree drawing issue ?
Feb 28 15:33:54 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, let's disscuss:
Feb 28 15:34:04 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I can fix the issue by commenting out line line of code
Feb 28 15:34:12 <lufimtse>	which is actually a workaround to a previous issue
Feb 28 15:34:19 <lufimtse>	but I don't know if it breaks stuff
Feb 28 15:34:24 <lufimtse>	basically, 
Feb 28 15:34:38 <lufimtse>	if you would insert a column with no items, it used to cause problems
Feb 28 15:34:45 <lufimtse>	so they inserted it hidden (visible=false)
Feb 28 15:34:51 <lufimtse>	and then made it visible when the first item was shown
Feb 28 15:35:00 <lufimtse>	in the past it seemed to cause ATK to crash
Feb 28 15:35:13 <lufimtse>	but now I've tested inserting visible columns, it doesn't crash atk anymore
Feb 28 15:38:21 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: even with gtk2 ?
Feb 28 15:38:38 <akurtakov>	can you think of other reason to insert column invisible 
Feb 28 15:38:53 <lufimtse>	so the trouble is I'm not very aqainted with Tables/Trees
Feb 28 15:38:56 <lufimtse>	so I'm now reading up on them
Feb 28 15:39:09 <lufimtse>	I.e aquiring Table-foo
Feb 28 15:39:27 <lufimtse>	Option 1) Fix it proper. Which might take a while.
Feb 28 15:39:36 <lufimtse>	Option 2) Fix quicker, and hope for the best.
Feb 28 15:39:49 <lufimtse>	with option 2, just test all snippets 
Feb 28 15:39:52 <lufimtse>	and IDE
Feb 28 15:39:58 <lufimtse>	if all looks well, go for it.
Feb 28 15:40:08 <lufimtse>	with option 1, really understand why we're hiding stuff
Feb 28 15:40:18 <lufimtse>	and see if we can get rid of the hiding mechanism altogether
Feb 28 15:40:25 <lufimtse>	as it seems to cause bunch of drawing issues
Feb 28 15:40:33 <lufimtse>	also the invisibility of columns is generating some warnings for atk
Feb 28 15:40:41 <lufimtse>	e.g: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=399522
Feb 28 15:41:15 <lufimtse>	Suggestion: 
Feb 28 15:41:47 <lufimtse>	I'll spent some time to figure out the visibility, a few days. If I make good propress go the long route. If I don't make a quicker fix and hope for the best.
Feb 28 15:41:50 <lufimtse>	wdyt?
Feb 28 15:45:59 <akurtakov>	sounds god
Feb 28 15:46:00 <akurtakov>	good
Feb 28 15:46:41 <lufimtse>	ok
Feb 28 15:46:41 <akurtakov>	if snippets and IDE are fine and issue is found we have to enhance snippets/tests to catch the new issue
Feb 28 15:47:45 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I'm seriously troubled that comments like the latest from Andrey are seriously hurting us
Feb 28 15:48:04 <akurtakov>	IMHO, things are not that bad as he presents it but meh
Feb 28 15:48:16 <ericwill>	akurtakov I was about to mention that
Feb 28 15:48:33 <ericwill>	akurtakov why is he being like this, especially since we have been putting efforts into fixing his stuff
Feb 28 15:49:04 <akurtakov>	well, negative people cause damage to everything they get close to 
Feb 28 15:49:07 <akurtakov>	that's it
Feb 28 15:49:08 <akurtakov>	:)
Feb 28 15:50:00 <ericwill>	akurtakov is it worth responding to him or no
Feb 28 15:50:10 <ericwill>	re: his latest email on platform-swt-dev
Feb 28 15:50:16 <akurtakov>	ericwill: if you have what to say :)
Feb 28 15:50:31 <akurtakov>	mine would not be polite so I would better stay silent :)
Feb 28 15:51:13 <ericwill>	haha okay
Feb 28 15:51:50 <akurtakov>	and Bulgarian is way more "colorful" than English
Feb 28 15:52:02 <akurtakov>	so luckily I can't even translate what I have to say fully :)
Feb 28 15:52:18 <ericwill>	it's better this way :)
Feb 28 15:53:05 <akurtakov>	yeah, I started writing a reply and deleted it after the second sentence
Feb 28 15:57:52 <ericwill>	akurtakov I have reached the same conclusion :) not worth the time to respond to him
Feb 28 15:59:28 <akurtakov>	ericwill: the only effect such comments have on me is becoming more stubborn and selfish
Feb 28 16:00:00 <akurtakov>	and be even more sure in my agenda even if others might not like it
Feb 28 16:00:17 <akurtakov>	it's not like anyone tries to be nice with me so why should I be :0
Feb 28 16:04:00 <ericwill>	it makes me less motivated to work on his bugs :)
Feb 28 16:04:23 <ericwill>	though Simeon seems reasonable (and quite helpful)
Feb 28 16:04:45 <lufimtse>	well
Feb 28 16:04:55 <lufimtse>	Having background in customer support
Feb 28 16:05:27 <lufimtse>	maybe say that we've put a fair bit of work into reducing warnings (links to warnings fixes), and that we're putting in effort to remove more of such.
Feb 28 16:05:40 <lufimtse>	Telling people their problem is not important usually doesn's slide well
Feb 28 16:06:03 <lufimtse>	and thank them for bringing up the warning issue
Feb 28 16:06:47 <lufimtse>	and encourage bug submissions for warnings for which we don't yet have snippets to reproduce
Feb 28 16:06:52 <lufimtse>	and maybe vote.
Feb 28 16:07:08 <lufimtse>	then fix warnings they mentioned, and tell them we fixed it.
Feb 28 16:07:11 <lufimtse>	Then they will be happy.
Feb 28 16:07:32 <lufimtse>	And tell others about their happy eclipse experience
Feb 28 16:08:06 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Feb 28 16:08:18 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I would do that for newcomers
Feb 28 16:08:30 <akurtakov>	but for seasoned committers - HELL NO
Feb 28 16:08:40 <akurtakov>	I expect way more from them in terms of behavious
Feb 28 16:08:44 <akurtakov>	behavior
Feb 28 16:09:30 <lufimtse>	What did andrey say that is bad anyway?
Feb 28 16:09:44 <lufimtse>	that they hide the warnings from their customers?
Feb 28 16:10:10 <lufimtse>	meh
Feb 28 16:10:57 <akurtakov>	that the only way is removing Gtk3
Feb 28 16:11:15 <akurtakov>	without any proposal backed with resources to act 
Feb 28 16:11:24 <akurtakov>	that's unacceptable behavior from committer
Feb 28 16:12:06 <lufimtse>	that's fair.
Feb 28 16:12:25 <lufimtse>	It may be worth pointing out that gtk2 doesn't work proper as there is no webkit1 on newer linux systems
Feb 28 16:13:04 <lufimtse>	so javadoc doesn't even work proper on fedora27 with eclipse on gtk2 (I think)
Feb 28 16:13:15 <lufimtse>	*best effort :-)
Feb 28 16:13:25 <lufimtse>	usually explaining things works well.
Feb 28 16:13:47 <lufimtse>	I could respond to him.
Feb 28 16:13:49 *	akurtakov is beyond that point with Andrey for swt stuff :)
Feb 28 16:14:03 <akurtakov>	his SWT mails simply be ignored
Feb 28 16:14:18 <lufimtse>	I lived in Germany for 6 years and spoke with German clients for 2 years. Germans have a certain way of thinking/behaving :-)
Feb 28 16:14:38 <lufimtse>	Which might seem strange to non-german people
Feb 28 16:14:57 <lufimtse>	X-D
Feb 28 16:15:05 *	lufimtse goes back to study tables.
Feb 28 16:15:25 <akurtakov>	so I am free to act with my Balkan habbits ? :P
Feb 28 16:16:52 <lufimtse>	I think with people from Germany, they generally focus on the problem, which comes across as being rude
Feb 28 16:17:09 <lufimtse>	the key is not to take it personal :-)
Feb 28 16:17:22 <akurtakov>	and here we just say it directly in the eyes when one acts as asshole :)
Feb 28 16:17:43 <akurtakov>	and we don't take it personally :)
Feb 28 16:17:47 <lufimtse>	ha ha
Feb 28 16:18:17 <ericwill>	Thomas Singer focuses on the problem, Andrey goes beyond that: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=527729#c2
Feb 28 16:18:57 <lufimtse>	X-D. omg,
Feb 28 16:19:00 <lufimtse>	that's intense
Feb 28 16:23:45 <akurtakov>	yeah, Thomas Singer is good guy - quite demanding but always sticks to the technical part
Feb 28 16:36:46 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, after reading the comment about the North Korean children, I see what you mean about Andrey
Feb 28 16:38:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov for the context menu bug: how concerned are you for a fix on GTK3 versions less than 3.22
Feb 28 16:38:37 <akurtakov>	ericwill: not much
Feb 28 16:38:51 <akurtakov>	if you can fix it for 3.22 - that's fine
Feb 28 16:39:03 <ericwill>	kk
Feb 28 16:40:57 <akurtakov>	ericwill: technically, I'm fine with closing bugs with statements like "fixed with Gtk 3.22, fixing for older versions will be significant effort which would better be spent elsewhere"
Feb 28 16:41:07 <akurtakov>	"please update your GTK version"
Feb 28 16:41:26 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, why? do you have a breakthrough requiring gtk 3.22 added api ?
Feb 28 16:41:54 <ericwill>	okay, sounds good
Feb 28 16:41:55 <ericwill>	akurtakov yes
Feb 28 16:42:05 <akurtakov>	ericwill: that's interesting
Feb 28 16:42:23 <akurtakov>	ericwill: in general the oldest version we care about is the latest RHEL 7 
Feb 28 16:42:32 <akurtakov>	which in this case is 3.22 :)
Feb 28 16:42:42 <ericwill>	akurtakov I didn't use new API but the fix works with the newest API, 3.20- menu popup API is really ancient
Feb 28 16:43:48 <ericwill>	as you have to provide a menu positioning callback function and that sort of thing -- effort not worth it IMO
Feb 28 16:44:16 <akurtakov>	ericwill: fine with me
Feb 28 16:44:31 <akurtakov>	IMHO we have been playing too nice with old versions
Feb 28 16:45:42 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/118383/ ?
Feb 28 16:45:53 <ericwill>	akurtakov that's the fix yes
Feb 28 16:45:58 <ericwill>	in the process of testing it now
Feb 28 16:46:11 <akurtakov>	ericwill: it's x11 only
Feb 28 16:46:14 <akurtakov>	what about wayland ?
Feb 28 16:46:21 <ericwill>	akurtakov wayland doesn't have the bug
Feb 28 16:48:01 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ah ok
Feb 28 16:48:19 <akurtakov>	so the positioning issues on wayland are handled in other bugs ?
Feb 28 16:49:04 <ericwill>	akurtakov are they any other menu positioning issues on Wayland? I thought the last was the show-in business
Feb 28 16:49:09 <ericwill>	*are there
Feb 28 16:49:23 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ah you fixed it
Feb 28 16:50:18 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, I really hate that with the show-in clicking outside the popup doesn't close it :)
Feb 28 16:50:23 <akurtakov>	but it's anothe bug
Feb 28 16:50:40 <ericwill>	akurtakov yeah that's a focus issue, not just for menus IIRC
Feb 28 16:51:03 <akurtakov>	ericwill: good to see progress on the positioning
Feb 28 16:51:12 <akurtakov>	esp as we will be able to close the RHEL issue
Feb 28 16:52:17 <ericwill>	akurtakov yes I hope I can get this fix in for M6
Feb 28 16:52:20 *	ericwill is tired of menus
Feb 28 16:52:55 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I have to update Jetty and finally merge sha-256 checksup support in p2 tomorrow :)
Feb 28 16:53:18 <akurtakov>	no time to even get tired
Feb 28 16:54:35 <ericwill>	akurtakov :(
Feb 28 16:54:50 <akurtakov>	and security is the area I hate most
Feb 28 17:06:32 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: do you remember what you meant by "I need to address Debug expression viewer on dark theme also." The expression view seems fine on linux and win32.
Feb 28 17:09:03 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, thinking
Feb 28 17:09:10 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, retrieving memory from tape backup
Feb 28 17:09:35 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, what bug?
Feb 28 17:10:03 <rgrunber>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=508793#c7
Feb 28 17:10:22 <rgrunber>	Sarika made a bug from that note when she closed it https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=531795
Feb 28 17:10:45 <rgrunber>	however was your comment simply meant to say.. the debug hover should be addressed on dark theme.. which you did address later on..
Feb 28 17:11:08 <rgrunber>	ie you were addressing the debug hover on light theme first.. then probably came up with INFORMATION api to adress on dark also.
Feb 28 17:11:38 <rgrunber>	bcause the Expression View itself looks fine to me on dark theme
Feb 28 17:12:07 <lufimtse>	I recall there was something that it wasn't working when you debug stuff
Feb 28 17:12:20 <lufimtse>	lemme check
Feb 28 17:12:21 <lufimtse>	sec
Feb 28 17:14:45 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, now it looks better. It's black as oppose to being white (on dark theme), but it's a bit too black. It should have that gentle dray instead of dark black black
Feb 28 17:15:54 <rgrunber>	yeah i saw that too
Feb 28 17:16:15 <lufimtse>	s/dray/gray
Feb 28 17:16:36 <rgrunber>	but Sarika is basically saying something like the expression viewer is light on a dark theme..
Feb 28 17:16:56 <rgrunber>	read her comment on it
Feb 28 17:17:12 <lufimtse>	could be she's not using Adwaita
Feb 28 17:17:15 <lufimtse>	maybe
Feb 28 17:17:29 <lufimtse>	I haven't tested with non-adwaita
Feb 28 17:17:52 <lufimtse>	or she has old gtk..
Feb 28 17:18:00 <lufimtse>	works well on my dark eclipse
Feb 28 17:18:13 <rgrunber>	iirc she runs Macos right ?
Feb 28 17:18:35 <rgrunber>	but yeah no idea.. guess i'll ask for clarification
Feb 28 17:20:35 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: probably the Expression view gets fixed on Fedora by our hack to switch to Adwaita:dark
Feb 28 17:20:48 <akurtakov>	please try with another theme and you'll probably see the issue
Feb 28 17:22:06 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: alternatively you can try running as child eclipse without org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk
Feb 28 17:25:34 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk really fixes many dark theme issues on proper GTK :)
Feb 28 17:26:04 <akurtakov>	or to be exact hides improper theming :)
Feb 28 17:28:28 <rgrunber>	expression view still shows up .. dark.
Feb 28 17:28:50 <rgrunber>	in fact it was the same on windows so i kinda wondered if it could be linux related at all..
Feb 28 17:29:04 <rgrunber>	though yeah.. that little fragment actually makes dark theme look better
Feb 28 17:30:34 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: than post screenshot and say you don't see what's to be fixed there :)
Feb 28 17:30:53 <rgrunber>	yeh.. basically.. we shall see
Feb 28 17:31:05 <rgrunber>	*almost said we shell see
Mar 01 10:24:47 <akurtakov>	ericwill: 
Mar 01 10:25:08 <akurtakov>	ericwill: under wayland
Mar 01 10:25:11 <akurtakov>	open Problems view
Mar 01 10:25:23 <akurtakov>	click on the down arrow button to see menu
Mar 01 10:25:35 <akurtakov>	it opens in totally werid place
Mar 01 10:25:57 <ericwill>	akurtakov hmm I can't reproduce that
Mar 01 10:26:34 <ericwill>	akurtakov send screenshot?
Mar 01 10:26:51 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://imagebin.ca/v/3tOA5HrJ8hJM
Mar 01 10:27:02 <akurtakov>	I was preparing when you asked for it
Mar 01 10:27:37 <ericwill>	akurtakov and by the arrow button you mean the one next to the maximize/minimize, right?
Mar 01 10:28:00 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yes, the "View menu"
Mar 01 10:28:49 <ericwill>	akurtakov can't reproduce it
Mar 01 10:28:54 <ericwill>	akurtakov try a clean workspace?
Mar 01 10:28:57 <akurtakov>	ericwill: wayland ?
Mar 01 10:29:14 <ericwill>	akurtakov yeah I use wayland full time, can't reproduce it on my M5 build or a child eclipse with master
Mar 01 10:30:05 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, make it fast view
Mar 01 10:30:13 <akurtakov>	ericwill: and restart eclipse
Mar 01 10:30:29 <akurtakov>	ericwill: it worked with clean workspace initially
Mar 01 10:30:40 <akurtakov>	but as I always have it as fast view I tried
Mar 01 10:30:58 <ericwill>	akurtakov what is a fast view
Mar 01 10:31:06 <akurtakov>	even making it back not fast view the menu keeps appearing wrong
Mar 01 10:31:20 <akurtakov>	ericwill: click the minimize button  :)
Mar 01 10:31:44 <akurtakov>	fast view - a view that hides when another one becomes actie :)
Mar 01 10:32:30 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay now I can reproduce it
Mar 01 10:32:43 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I'm not sure whether to say good :0
Mar 01 10:33:15 <ericwill>	akurtakov probably a symptom of: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=530204
Mar 01 10:33:26 <ericwill>	most of the menus attached to buttons use Menu.setLocation()
Mar 01 10:33:38 <ericwill>	and on Wayland with no global coords this is broken :)
Mar 01 10:33:58 <akurtakov>	well mouse is at the button :)
Mar 01 10:37:02 <ericwill>	akurtakov I thought so too but a lot of these menus are called like this: https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.ui/blob/9eb944951a256f97fbbc78ad4749d1cbd04925d3/bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/OpenResourceDialog.java#L336
Mar 01 10:38:26 <ericwill>	akurtakov either way I'll look into it
Mar 01 10:40:38 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I see 
Mar 01 10:40:54 <akurtakov>	so we need to fix the callers ?
Mar 01 10:41:10 <akurtakov>	have you documented that this is not working on wayland in the javadoc
Mar 01 10:41:21 <akurtakov>	it would be needed when we go fixing callers
Mar 01 10:41:33 <akurtakov>	at least I don't see other option - do you ?
Mar 01 10:41:49 <ericwill>	akurtakov well currently Menu.setLocation() is completely ignored
Mar 01 10:42:08 <ericwill>	we should fix that first, then try to fix the callers
Mar 01 10:42:14 <akurtakov>	ericwill: fix how ?
Mar 01 10:42:45 <ericwill>	akurtakov with GTK3.22 we have: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkMenu.html#gtk-menu-popup-at-rect
Mar 01 10:42:54 <ericwill>	we should check in menu._setVisible
Mar 01 10:43:09 <ericwill>	"if (hasLocation), do x"
Mar 01 10:45:34 <ericwill>	if you look in Menu.java, the x and y variables are never used when popping up the menu
Mar 01 10:46:16 <ericwill>	that said, we should probably fix the javadocs as well because Menu.setLocation() is global coords, not parent-relative
Mar 01 10:46:27 <akurtakov>	ericwill: so how does it open correctly now ?
Mar 01 10:46:32 <akurtakov>	if x and y are not used ?
Mar 01 10:46:43 <akurtakov>	s/now/on x11/
Mar 01 10:47:06 <ericwill>	it grabs the mouse button event and pops up there, the fact that it works on X11 is a coincidence :)
Mar 01 10:47:22 <akurtakov>	ericwill: wow :)
Mar 01 10:47:31 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, ask Andrey to verify the bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=431423
Mar 01 10:47:41 <akurtakov>	we should throw work at him :)
Mar 01 10:48:11 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, Expression viewer looks nice on Dark theme now. Thanks. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=272961
Mar 01 10:48:38 <ericwill>	akurtakov will do :)
Mar 01 11:09:14 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: but i'm pretty sure it's uglier somewhere.. either windows
Mar 01 14:37:05 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, nie
Mar 01 14:37:10 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, nice

Mar 05 13:11:08 <akurtakov>	it's terrible and will look broken if one tries the advertised Photon content
Mar 05 13:11:18 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay, added to my list
Mar 05 13:11:40 <akurtakov>	ericwill: cool, are you out of tasks :)
Mar 05 13:12:09 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, the menu thing on wayland is smth I see daily :)
Mar 05 13:12:14 <akurtakov>	with problems view :)
Mar 05 13:15:55 <ericwill>	akurtakov my tasks list was running low :P and alright I'll look into the wayland thing as well
Mar 05 13:26:11 <akurtakov>	ericwill: well, I don't mind taking a day per week for low hanging fruit se we can see more things fixed :)
Mar 05 13:27:27 <ericwill>	akurtakov I'll keep it in mind
Mar 05 14:33:07 <ericwill>	akurtakov formatter button bug is a regression from my fix for GTK allocation warnings :)

Mar 07 16:05:35 <lufimtse>	ericwill, you might find my last comment mildly entertaining: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=531785#c5
Mar 07 16:17:12 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: well he did say his memory might be wrong :P
Mar 07 16:21:00 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, true. I was just making fun.
Mar 07 16:21:19 <rgrunber>	joke obliterated.. you're welcome
Mar 09 13:15:54 <lufimtse>	ericwill, remember our little code coverage hack where we export to html, into a git repo and use git diff to find differences between sessions?
Mar 09 13:16:05 <ericwill>	lufimtse yes
Mar 09 13:17:37 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I wrote script hack things further.  I delete non-java files and remove pesky "timespamp" header/footer of files. The result is that you get a list of only files with actual diffs.
Mar 09 13:17:40 <lufimtse>	https://pastebin.com/354GHvkC
Mar 09 13:17:59 <lufimtse>	we get: https://i.imgur.com/GY4JP33.png

Mar 09 13:18:51 <lufimtse>	I'll show you when you get in. 
Mar 09 13:19:19 <lufimtse>	The nice thing (at least for me) , it shows the changes in the ruler: https://i.imgur.com/kHIzhKB.png
Mar 09 13:19:32 <lufimtse>	so I can open a file and quickly see which bits differeed between runs
Mar 09 13:20:20 <ericwill>	lufimtse ah yeah I never thought of it that way. A lot better than using meld
Mar 09 13:45:39 <ericwill>	lufimtse now I am running into table.pack() problems
Mar 09 13:45:59 <lufimtse>	ericwill, oh dear :-/
Mar 09 13:46:30 <ericwill>	lufimtse I'll show you in the office on Monday
Mar 09 13:47:59 <lufimtse>	ericwill, ok
Mar 09 15:57:35 <lufimtse>	ericwill, the TableDrawing seems to be cache related. If tableColumns are visible between the (+-1) 5th and (+-1) 10th g_main_context_iteration(..), the drawing issue doesn't occur on 4/5 runs. But sporadically without code change it does occur.
Mar 09 15:57:49 <lufimtse>	To figure out: https://i.imgur.com/nlLpR3b.png
Mar 09 15:57:53 <lufimtse>	hacks ^

Mar 09 15:58:15 <lufimtse>	sfc = show first column
Mar 09 15:58:24 <lufimtse>	like it shows first column, for 5 iterations
Mar 09 15:58:28 <lufimtse>	then hides
Mar 09 15:58:30 <lufimtse>	and all is well
Mar 09 15:58:31 <lufimtse>	hmm
Mar 09 15:58:37 <ericwill>	I wonder what triggers the cache reset
Mar 09 15:59:05 <lufimtse>	hmm
Mar 09 16:04:15 <ericwill>	lufimtse I have bug where moving the pack() calls around in the snippet changes the behaviour, I can show you on Monday
Mar 09 16:42:47 <lufimtse>	ok
Mar 09 16:43:06 <lufimtse>	I guess we have no "cache-finished" signal of sorts..

Mar 16 10:54:34 <ericwill>	akurtakov for that right click menu context bug, anything I have to do in the RH BZ? or will Mat take care of it once he backports
Mar 16 10:55:01 <akurtakov>	ericwill: plese comment in the bug pointing to the bug 
Mar 16 10:55:06 <akurtakov>	assuming it's not in 4.7.3
Mar 16 10:55:17 <akurtakov>	and ask for it tobe backported for 2018.2
Mar 16 10:55:25 <ericwill>	akurtakov kk will do
Mar 16 13:17:01 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: just saw your latest commit
Mar 16 13:17:09 <akurtakov>	are you aware of SnippetLauncher ?
Mar 16 13:17:45 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the requirement was to launch maybe 3-10 selected junits 
Mar 16 13:17:57 <lufimtse>	I haven't used SnippetLauncher, but I gather they usually launch individual snippets
Mar 16 13:18:11 <lufimtse>	or the grouping launches 5 junits as individual jUnits
Mar 16 13:19:35 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I get it's not exactly the same
Mar 16 13:19:50 <akurtakov>	at the same time JUnits are not good for visual inspection
Mar 16 13:20:18 <lufimtse>	what's a better option?
Mar 16 13:20:30 <lufimtse>	to quickly run through 20+ snippets?
Mar 16 13:20:31 <akurtakov>	thus I wonder whether some grouping of snippets and etc. enhancing snippetlauncher wouldn't be more fruitful long term 
Mar 16 13:21:07 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what is snippet launcher?
Mar 16 13:21:10 <lufimtse>	you mean the grouping?
Mar 16 13:21:26 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: there is SnippetLauncher.java
Mar 16 13:21:33 <akurtakov>	in snippets folder
Mar 16 13:23:43 <lufimtse>	interesting
Mar 16 13:24:59 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: yeah, I try to have one way to do thing in project that everyone is aware of instead of having dozen of quite similar things and no one knowing all of them
Mar 16 13:26:50 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, yea, thanks for pointing out SnippetLauncher. That kinda seems like something that could be adapted into something simmilar.
Mar 16 13:27:05 <akurtakov>	yup, that's what I thought too 
Mar 16 13:27:19 <lufimtse>	I'll mention to Eric also
Mar 16 13:27:25 <lufimtse>	Ok, so for fix
Mar 16 13:27:29 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/119588/
Mar 16 13:27:34 <lufimtse>	kinda hacky, 
Mar 16 13:28:06 <lufimtse>	but gtk3's delayed initialization makes the only viable option I could think of
Mar 16 13:29:24 <lufimtse>	Basically Gtk3 delays initialization of some structures till the 5th - 10th time g_main_context_loop() thing is ran
Mar 16 13:29:56 <lufimtse>	if during this time a tree/table column is invisible, SWT custom drawn tree/tables produce cheese/garbage
Mar 16 13:30:16 <lufimtse>	I gather this is because gtk3 skips a bunch of code if column is invisible
Mar 16 13:31:08 <lufimtse>	I put bits of the fix  into Control.java as it's used for both Tree and Table, and I might have to use it for a visibility issue I observed with RowLayout
Mar 16 13:33:25 <lufimtse>	ericwill, btw, you around?
Mar 16 13:33:30 <ericwill>	lufimtse yo
Mar 16 13:34:10 <lufimtse>	Hacky, but wdyt? https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/119588/
Mar 16 13:34:41 <lufimtse>	I had to go down the HashTable route as not all columns have a TableColumn object. E.g first column when Table is created.
Mar 16 13:35:10 <lufimtse>	ericwill, it also fixes the acessibility warning: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=399522
Mar 16 13:36:22 <ericwill>	lufimtse okay, let me take a look
Mar 16 13:38:42 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, could you also review and let me know if you see any red flags: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/119588/
Mar 16 13:38:51 <lufimtse>	in case I missed something.
Mar 16 13:38:58 <akurtakov>	I'll try to do it later today
Mar 16 13:39:09 <lufimtse>	ok
Mar 16 13:39:14 <akurtakov>	it's friday evening 
Mar 16 13:39:26 <akurtakov>	with 1/4 final in the national volley championship :)
Mar 16 13:40:03 <ericwill>	akurtakov volleyball?
Mar 16 13:40:48 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yeah, my town team made it to it first time in 15+ years :)
Mar 16 13:41:00 *	akurtakov was in highschool last time this happened
Mar 16 13:41:03 <rgrunber>	ooo
Mar 16 13:41:12 <ericwill>	ncie :)
Mar 16 13:41:15 <ericwill>	*nice
Mar 16 13:41:24 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: i guess you were on that team :P that's why
Mar 16 13:41:43 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: I can assure you my sport skills can destroy any team :)
Mar 16 13:41:48 <rgrunber>	must have a high vertical jump
Mar 16 13:42:43 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: I mean any team I'm part of :)
Mar 16 13:43:04 <akurtakov>	ttyl guys
Mar 16 13:43:47 <rgrunber>	cya!
Mar 16 13:46:18 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, have a nice weekend.

Mar 20 10:17:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov what version of eclipse do we have in RHEL? 2018.1 is Oxygen.2 right?
Mar 20 10:18:04 <scela>	ericwill: yes
Mar 20 10:18:15 <akurtakov>	ericwill: whic RHEL
Mar 20 10:18:24 <ericwill>	akurtakov 7.4
Mar 20 10:18:26 <akurtakov>	7.4 has 3.22
Mar 20 10:18:45 <ericwill>	akurtakov the Eclipse version :)
Mar 20 10:19:04 <akurtakov>	ericwill: oops :)
Mar 20 10:19:17 <akurtakov>	4.7.2
Mar 20 10:19:35 <akurtakov>	2018.2 should be 4.7.3
Mar 20 10:19:42 <akurtakov>	2018.3 should be 4.8.0
Mar 20 10:23:16 <ericwill>	okay
Mar 20 10:23:47 <ericwill>	I see we have a customer case from Andrey about the table editing...
Mar 20 10:25:52 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yeah
Mar 20 10:26:00 <akurtakov>	it's beneficial for us :)
Mar 20 10:29:19 <scela>	akurtakov: 2018.2 is 4.7.3a right?
Mar 20 10:29:59 <akurtakov>	scela: yes, but SWT can not contribute to 4.7.3a only jdt so for the sake of discussion with eric it's the same :)
Mar 20 10:30:23 <scela>	akurtakov: sure, just double-checking my mental notes :)
Mar 20 10:30:24 <ericwill>	akurtakov I am pretty sure this bug is fixed in 4.8 already but I need to check to be 100% sure
Mar 20 10:30:44 <akurtakov>	ericwill: if fixed - same procedure as the previous one
Mar 20 10:30:50 <akurtakov>	point Mat to the commit for backport
Mar 20 10:31:15 <ericwill>	okay
Mar 20 10:31:25 <akurtakov>	in the bug
Mar 20 11:26:59 <ericwill>	akurtakov done
Mar 20 11:27:07 <akurtakov>	ericwill: thanks
Mar 20 11:55:16 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: here ?
Mar 20 11:55:38 <akurtakov>	have you ever compiled swt on windows?
Mar 20 11:57:21 <ericwill>	akurtakov he's AFK
Mar 20 12:00:14 <akurtakov>	ericwill: do you know anything about it ?
Mar 20 12:00:32 <akurtakov>	ericwill: it all comes from https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=531097
Mar 20 12:00:45 <akurtakov>	and IBM guys are "busy" again
Mar 20 12:01:03 <akurtakov>	risking to lose another prominent swt win32 contributor
Mar 20 12:01:11 <akurtakov>	so I wondered what can we do
Mar 20 12:01:29 <ericwill>	akurtakov I have no clue about the windows stuff
Mar 20 12:01:38 <ericwill>	maybe Lakshmi knows something?
Mar 20 12:01:52 <akurtakov>	ericwill: well, they want to delay for the future
Mar 20 12:02:15 <akurtakov>	and guess what will happen when you tell someone wait 4 months and we may look into your contributions
Mar 20 12:02:25 <akurtakov>	I have seen this movie often enough
Mar 20 12:02:47 <ericwill>	akurtakov pretty sad IMO
Mar 20 12:02:55 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/117609/3
Mar 20 12:03:06 <akurtakov>	it looks pretty safe to me with my gtk knowledge
Mar 20 12:03:17 <akurtakov>	scela: can we get access to windows machine ?
Mar 20 12:04:02 <ericwill>	akurtakov we have a windows VM running on a mac, here in the office. but it's pretty slow
Mar 20 12:04:14 <ericwill>	Leo and I are thinking of putting a windows partition on that laptop that Ian had
Mar 20 12:04:22 <akurtakov>	ericwill: what is the window version ?
Mar 20 12:04:42 <ericwill>	Windows 10
Mar 20 12:05:00 <akurtakov>	perfect
Mar 20 12:05:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: so please ask Leo whether he compiled swt at all on window
Mar 20 12:05:37 <ericwill>	akurtakov will do
Mar 20 12:05:52 <akurtakov>	and ask him to do a quick try  if he succeeds to try with the patch and whether the ide is useful with the new one
Mar 20 12:06:04 <akurtakov>	not more than 1-2h :)
Mar 20 12:06:15 <akurtakov>	as I expect issues
Mar 20 12:06:51 <akurtakov>	ericwill: thanks
Mar 20 12:07:18 <scela>	akurtakov: still need it?
Mar 20 12:07:27 <scela>	was in a call
Mar 20 12:07:49 <akurtakov>	scela: looks like there is one in toronto office
Mar 20 12:07:53 <akurtakov>	so should be fine
Mar 20 12:07:56 <scela>	cool
Mar 20 12:10:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hello
Mar 20 12:11:42 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I haven't compiled anything ever on Windows
Mar 20 12:11:47 <lufimtse>	:-/
Mar 20 12:12:00 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, last time I investigated, there wasn't much documentation, 
Mar 20 12:12:12 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I could look into it, but it would take me a while.
Mar 20 12:12:19 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: just try it
Mar 20 12:12:33 <akurtakov>	if it doesn't work so be it, we shold know what's blocking u
Mar 20 12:12:47 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, how much time to commit if it takes longer?
Mar 20 12:12:51 <lufimtse>	you said 1-2 hours?
Mar 20 12:12:54 <akurtakov>	not more
Mar 20 12:13:02 <akurtakov>	if it doesn't work in that time
Mar 20 12:13:12 <lufimtse>	ok, I'll give it a brief shot.
Mar 20 12:13:16 <akurtakov>	let's open a bug for documentation,tooling whatever
Mar 20 12:13:25 <akurtakov>	and see where we canmove
Mar 20 12:16:42 <lufimtse>	 ok
Mar 20 16:40:28 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hey
Mar 20 16:40:35 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, u still around?
Mar 20 16:41:01 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: what's up?
Mar 20 16:41:59 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so with a fair bit of hackery, I got SWT compiled on Win32 and I ran snippets with the newly compiled binary files.
Mar 20 16:42:32 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, to review the patches, I guess I would have to ensure things compile and tests pass with the new patches?
Mar 20 16:42:35 <lufimtse>	(I'm on Win10)
Mar 20 16:42:46 <akurtakov>	sounds good
Mar 20 16:42:47 <lufimtse>	and test with a child eclipse?
Mar 20 16:43:25 <lufimtse>	I take it I won't be tesitng with Windows 7 & vista?
Mar 20 16:43:52 <lufimtse>	Should I announce things on mailing list about me testing the patches and if I find no faults merge them?
Mar 20 16:44:00 <lufimtse>	(swt mail list) akurtakov 
Mar 20 16:44:19 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: just test the first patch in the series
Mar 20 16:44:23 <akurtakov>	and give comment on it
Mar 20 16:44:26 <akurtakov>	in gerrit
Mar 20 16:44:47 <akurtakov>	what I look for is not losing the contributor e.g. merging a commit or two
Mar 20 16:44:56 <akurtakov>	and leaving the rest for IBMers
Mar 20 16:45:05 <akurtakov>	for after Photon
Mar 20 16:45:17 <akurtakov>	just to show some good will towards contributor
Mar 20 16:45:28 <lufimtse>	ok
Mar 20 16:46:31 <akurtakov>	first and second patch look quite safe to me
Mar 20 16:46:51 <akurtakov>	the others that change types unicode and etc. need better win32 knowledhe imho
Mar 20 16:47:55 <lufimtse>	ok

Mar 23 12:50:42 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, u need now?

Mar 26 10:50:05 <scela>	lufimtse: I've disabled mine on my pc

Mar 26 10:50:33 <lufimtse>	scela, I see, via hackery I guess :-)
Mar 26 10:51:14 <lufimtse>	I think if get a pocket of time, I'll fix up the laptop to be our windows-only box.
Mar 26 10:51:21 <lufimtse>	so updates would be ok on it.
Mar 26 10:51:38 <lufimtse>	But low priority atm :-)
Mar 26 10:52:05 <lufimtse>	atm it only has 2 gb of free space on the windows partition

Mar 26 10:53:07 <scela>	that reminds I haven't updated my fedora in a while
Mar 26 10:53:22 <scela>	that's because akurtakov is not nagging me anymore :(

Mar 26 10:56:52 <lufimtse>	scela, ah yea, I think the update notification thing isn't there anymore. 
Mar 26 10:57:00 <lufimtse>	scela, has been annoying me for a long time.
Mar 26 14:01:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov that Wayland bug from the RH BZ is reproducible upstream, what is the priority on this
Mar 26 14:05:54 <akurtakov>	ericwill: is it a client ?
Mar 26 14:06:27 <ericwill>	akurtakov what do you mean
Mar 26 14:06:43 <ericwill>	there is no support case for it
Mar 26 14:06:58 <akurtakov>	ericwill: so please give me the link

Mar 26 14:07:38 <akurtakov>	ah, it's fedora bug
Mar 26 14:07:50 <akurtakov>	ericwill: lower than others :)
Mar 26 14:08:05 <akurtakov>	I thought it's RHEL one
Mar 26 14:08:41 <ericwill>	akurtakov nope, okay I'll file an upstream bug for it and add it to the wayland tracker

Mar 27 10:13:46 <ericwill>	akurtakov has there been discussion for the 4.9 target platforms
Mar 27 10:13:58 <ericwill>	sorry, "target environment"
Mar 27 10:14:35 <ericwill>	specifically the Ubuntu version
Mar 27 10:14:59 <akurtakov>	ericwill: not yet

Mar 27 10:15:35 <akurtakov>	it is last lts release
Mar 27 10:15:47 <ericwill>	akurtakov no I'm talking about 4.9
Mar 27 10:15:57 <ericwill>	can we push for it to be Ubuntu 18.04
Mar 27 10:15:59 <ericwill>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseSchedule
Mar 27 10:16:09 <ericwill>	16.04 has GTK3.18, which is pretty old
Mar 27 10:19:54 <akurtakov>	ericwill: for 4.9 for sure
Mar 27 10:20:14 <akurtakov>	I'll see whether we can do it for 4.8
Mar 27 10:20:45 <akurtakov>	hmm, I guess I would better wait for it to be released
Mar 27 10:21:38 <ericwill>	sounds good
Mar 27 10:23:54 <akurtakov>	ericwill: what about SLES 
Mar 27 10:24:50 <akurtakov>	anything you want to see there changed?
Mar 27 10:40:20 <ericwill>	akurtakov from what I can tell, SLES12 only has GTK3.10
Mar 27 10:40:37 <akurtakov>	ericwill: SP2 has 3.20 IIRC
Mar 27 10:41:11 <ericwill>	akurtakov if it does I am fine with it
Mar 27 10:41:17 <ericwill>	anything below 3.20 is a pain
Mar 27 10:41:50 <ericwill>	ideally 3.22 would be the only supported version, but 3.20 is okay too
Mar 27 11:20:05 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hey
Mar 27 11:20:12 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, sup
Mar 27 11:23:47 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, is there a way I can make your day better today?
Mar 27 11:26:17 <akurtakov>	can you come up with windows zip with swt replaced with the initial patch from this win series
Mar 27 11:26:46 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmm
Mar 27 11:27:41 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ~Maybe, although it might take me a day as I'll have to figure out how to build jars and inject them into a nightly eclipse build. Probably doable.
Mar 27 11:27:50 <lufimtse>	or 4 hours ish
Mar 27 11:28:10 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what's the motivation?
Mar 27 11:28:30 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, i.e, is child eclipse testing not sufficent?
Mar 27 11:28:34 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: works for me if you can get it in 4 hours
Mar 27 11:29:22 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what's the use case btw?
Mar 27 11:29:36 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: wider testing request on the PMC call
Mar 27 11:29:50 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, when's the due date for this task?
Mar 27 11:30:05 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: when can you do it
Mar 27 11:30:07 <akurtakov>	:)
Mar 27 11:31:32 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Well, I'm investigating the regression I introduced in Egit Interactive rebase and the webkit2 crash when clicking on an external link in javadoc
Mar 27 11:31:43 <lufimtse>	given the 3 tasks, which take priority?
Mar 27 11:32:29 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: if you can do it in 4h do it now
Mar 27 11:32:36 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok.
Mar 27 11:35:25 <akurtakov>	ericwill: will you please right click on a file
Mar 27 11:35:28 <akurtakov>	properties
Mar 27 11:35:39 <akurtakov>	Resourse
Mar 27 11:35:48 <akurtakov>	and see the permissions table
Mar 27 11:36:08 <akurtakov>	the checkboxes are no longer visible except for the first one
Mar 27 11:36:17 <akurtakov>	this is smth you fixed few months ago, right?
Mar 27 11:36:38 <ericwill>	akurtakov hmm might be, I have to look
Mar 27 11:37:26 <ericwill>	I can reproduce it on 4.8 M6
Mar 27 11:37:52 <ericwill>	okay Oxygen main release doesn't have the bug
Mar 27 11:37:57 <ericwill>	I'll investigate
Mar 27 11:56:34 <ericwill>	akurtakov so that bug is caused by my EGit icons patch, but is already fixed with the table editing patch I am working on right now :)
Mar 27 11:56:48 <lufimtse>	interesting 
Mar 27 12:01:58 <akurtakov>	ericwill: cool
Mar 27 12:02:01 <akurtakov>	any eta ?
Mar 27 12:02:07 <akurtakov>	what about some test for that ?
Mar 27 12:03:08 <ericwill>	akurtakov I have a test snippet
Mar 27 12:03:12 <ericwill>	no JUnits though
Mar 27 12:04:01 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok
Mar 27 12:04:13 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: how do you plan on fight the issue ?
Mar 27 12:04:13 <ericwill>	akurtakov as for ETA, I will have a gerrit by the end of the day
Mar 27 12:05:00 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: if/when you have the zip
Mar 27 12:05:05 <akurtakov>	x86_64 only is enough
Mar 27 12:05:09 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok
Mar 27 12:05:29 <akurtakov>	please publish it somewhere world visible and send me the link
Mar 27 12:05:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok
Mar 27 12:25:11 <ericwill>	akurtakov small caveat: my table editing patch only fixes cases for GTK3.20+, is that okay
Mar 27 12:25:32 *	ericwill is starting to hate GTK3 versions < 3.20
Mar 27 12:29:41 <rgrunber>	ericwill: any chance you could rank your top 3 most hated gtk versions ?
Mar 27 12:30:39 <ericwill>	1) anything before 3.20
Mar 27 12:30:42 <ericwill>	2) see above
Mar 27 12:30:44 <ericwill>	3) see above
Mar 27 12:30:49 <ericwill>	:)
Mar 27 13:47:11 <akurtakov>	ericwill: works for me :)
Mar 27 13:47:30 <akurtakov>	as long as latest gtk3 version works we can tell people - please upgrade
Mar 27 13:49:39 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay :)
Mar 27 13:51:43 <akurtakov>	ericwill: it's better to concentrate and have things working on one version
Mar 27 13:51:53 <akurtakov>	rather than have smth broken on each :)
Mar 27 13:52:11 <ericwill>	akurtakov I agree 100% I just wanted to confirm
Mar 27 15:05:30 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/117609/
Mar 27 15:06:01 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmm
Mar 27 15:06:30 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: the comment before last
Mar 27 15:06:46 <lufimtse>	@Alex, as discussed in the PMC call, can your team provide a build with this patch?
Mar 27 15:06:48 <lufimtse>	^
Mar 27 15:06:49 <lufimtse>	that
Mar 27 15:08:50 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: yes :)
Mar 27 15:09:12 <akurtakov>	so if whenyou get a build feel free to announce it there too
Mar 27 15:09:18 <lufimtse>	ok
Mar 27 15:09:25 <akurtakov>	any concerns about the build ?
Mar 27 15:09:33 <lufimtse>	I got the .jar build, but it was missing the .class files
Mar 27 15:09:38 <lufimtse>	I copied them manually
Mar 27 15:09:43 <lufimtse>	now has it, but not sure if it'll work
Mar 27 15:09:47 <lufimtse>	currently extracting a downloaded eclipse
Mar 27 15:10:04 <lufimtse>	would be useful to have some kind of instructions 
Mar 27 15:10:09 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: are you not using maven ?
Mar 27 15:10:15 <lufimtse>	maven on windows?
Mar 27 15:10:18 <lufimtse>	I haven't got that working
Mar 27 15:10:24 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: what's the issue?
Mar 27 15:10:41 <akurtakov>	and you may build the dlls on windows 
Mar 27 15:10:48 <akurtakov>	copy them to swt.binaries on linux
Mar 27 15:10:53 <lufimtse>	so far I've used the build.xml
Mar 27 15:10:58 <akurtakov>	and build with maven there
Mar 27 15:11:04 <lufimtse>	I think a long time ago I've experimented with maven
Mar 27 15:11:07 <lufimtse>	been a while 
Mar 27 15:11:07 <akurtakov>	to get the windows fragment
Mar 27 15:12:10 <lufimtse>	hmm
Mar 27 15:12:17 <lufimtse>	so the jar I build doesn't seem to work.
Mar 27 15:12:26 <lufimtse>	do you know, do the build servers use maven?
Mar 27 15:12:35 <lufimtse>	or build.xml?
Mar 27 15:12:40 <akurtakov>	for the fragments ?
Mar 27 15:12:43 <lufimtse>	idk
Mar 27 15:12:43 <akurtakov>	maven
Mar 27 15:13:27 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I strongly recommend not deviating from maven :)
Mar 27 15:13:38 <lufimtse>	ok
Mar 27 15:13:43 <lufimtse>	well, let's try that.
Mar 27 15:13:52 <akurtakov>	ericwill: have you spent time with maven :
Mar 27 15:18:37 <ericwill>	akurtakov only so far as in building the SWT jars
Mar 27 15:18:41 <ericwill>	otherwise, no
Mar 27 15:19:07 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, please look with lufimtse in case he faces issue with the maven build
Mar 27 15:19:16 <ericwill>	akurtakov will do
Mar 27 15:24:15 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, btw, were you refering to running maven on Linux with windows stuff copied from windows machine or run maven on windows?
Mar 27 15:24:37 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: the later is supposed to work
Mar 27 15:24:48 <akurtakov>	but the former is how we produce windows builds
Mar 27 15:24:56 <akurtakov>	so it definetely works
Mar 27 15:24:57 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, lol
Mar 27 15:24:58 <lufimtse>	ok
Mar 27 15:25:17 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so do we just copy the .dlls, or anything else. Do you know?
Mar 27 15:25:26 <lufimtse>	u know?
Mar 27 15:26:09 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: dlls only it seems http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.binaries.git/commit/bundles/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_64?id=541be12dbe92a452dabd08c260f3a37d50533b8d
Mar 27 15:26:34 <akurtakov>	wrong link
Mar 27 15:26:45 <akurtakov>	http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.binaries.git/commit/bundles/org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_64?id=541be12dbe92a452dabd08c260f3a37d50533b8d
Mar 27 15:28:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what am I looking for in that file?
Mar 27 15:28:23 <akurtakov>	it's not a file
Mar 27 15:28:41 <akurtakov>	it's a commit showing the copied files in sswt binaries on the last rebuild
Mar 27 15:29:41 <lufimtse>	this guy? http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.binaries.git/commit/bundles/org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_64?
Mar 27 15:30:02 <akurtakov>	yes 
Mar 27 15:30:04 <akurtakov>	see the log
Mar 27 15:30:24 <akurtakov>	for each vXXXX commit you can see what was copied
Mar 27 15:30:31 <akurtakov>	aka what you have to copy from win machine
Mar 27 15:31:39 <lufimtse>	ok, let me try.
Mar 27 15:46:13 <ericwill>	akurtakov https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=532931#c7
Mar 27 15:46:17 <ericwill>	do you know what he is talking about
Mar 27 15:46:34 <ericwill>	this looks like another case of Ubuntu only weirdness
Mar 27 15:47:27 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, what is the api to get the red TabFolder
Mar 27 15:47:39 <akurtakov>	paste him a snippet
Mar 27 15:49:01 <ericwill>	it's just ControlExample
Mar 27 15:49:06 <ericwill>	I didn't make a snippet
Mar 27 15:49:14 <ericwill>	akurtakov ^
Mar 27 15:49:55 <akurtakov>	so it's just TabFolder.setBackground
Mar 27 15:50:46 <ericwill>	akurtakov correct

Apr 10 10:21:40 <ericwill>	akurtakov things are good, the SWT castle didn't burn down while you were away :)
Apr 10 10:22:13 <akurtakov>	ericwill: haha 
Apr 10 10:22:14 <akurtakov>	nice
Apr 10 10:26:31 <akurtakov>	ericwill: anything that is worth mentioning?
Apr 10 10:27:17 <ericwill>	akurtakov nothing super exciting, patch reviews with Andrey/Simeon, more setRegion progress made, triage
Apr 10 10:27:36 <ericwill>	akurtakov oh, that Rolf guy has  proof of concept of Eclipse running on Windows with GTK3
Apr 10 10:28:36 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yeah I saw it
Apr 10 10:28:40 <akurtakov>	I had a call with him
Apr 10 10:28:51 <akurtakov>	friday before my vacation
Apr 10 10:28:56 <akurtakov>	looks like a nice guy
Apr 10 10:29:08 <akurtakov>	we spoke about launcher and possible move ahead
Apr 10 10:30:57 <ericwill>	akurtakov these sorts of things are great progress
Apr 10 10:33:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yeah
Apr 10 10:33:24 <akurtakov>	and he does it all for fun
Apr 10 10:33:27 <akurtakov>	which is even nicer
Apr 10 10:35:12 <ericwill>	akurtakov seems like we have two potential contributors for SWT on Windows

Apr 10 10:36:16 <akurtakov>	if we can get Nikita (the one removing XP now)

Apr 13 10:40:00 <ericwill>	18.04 LTS will be released in a few weeks, it has the latest GTK3 stack

Apr 23 14:18:57 <akurtakov>	ericwill: lufimtse: guys, would you please try the monitor sclaing patch
Apr 23 14:19:12 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, do you have the link again?
Apr 23 14:19:43 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I've kinda been archiving scaling patches
Apr 23 14:19:57 <lufimtse>	without looking at them much
Apr 23 14:19:59 <akurtakov>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/120695/
Apr 23 14:20:06 <akurtakov>	there was request to try it today
Apr 23 14:20:12 <akurtakov>	I wrote it
Apr 23 14:20:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok,
Apr 23 14:24:28 <ericwill>	akurtakov I'll check it out tomorrow
Apr 24 10:19:28 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, how do you enable scale in eclipse?
Apr 24 10:19:30 <lufimtse>	forgo
Apr 24 10:19:31 <lufimtse>	t
Apr 24 10:20:09 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, GDK_SCALE?
Apr 24 10:20:34 <akurtakov>	Settings/Devices/Display
Apr 24 10:20:40 <akurtakov>	scale 200% :)
Apr 24 10:20:54 <akurtakov>	it's for the whole display
Apr 24 10:21:51 <lufimtse>	I did that for one of my displays
Apr 24 10:22:11 <lufimtse>	I have 4 monitors bt
Apr 24 10:22:12 <lufimtse>	btw
Apr 24 10:22:16 <lufimtse>	laptop + 3 external
Apr 24 10:22:29 <lufimtse>	only the main laptop screen is hi-dpi.
Apr 24 10:22:57 <akurtakov>	you don't need the monitor to be hidpi to scale it to 200%
Apr 24 10:23:10 <lufimtse>	The option doesn't appear for non-hi-dpi monitors
Apr 24 10:23:10 <lufimtse>	meh
Apr 24 10:23:17 <lufimtse>	let me try to disconnect the other monitors
Apr 24 10:23:26 <lufimtse>	for child eclipse with you patch, do I need to set some flag?
Apr 24 10:24:20 <akurtakov>	no
Apr 24 10:24:44 <akurtakov>	just make sure you have changed to 200% prior to starting it
Apr 24 10:28:22 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what's the patch suppose to do btw?
Apr 24 10:28:39 <lufimtse>	I dissconnected my monitors. With only hi-dpi, when you launch eclipse, it's scaled 
Apr 24 10:28:57 <lufimtse>	but if I plug in an external monitor that isn't scaled, eclipse auto-scales down again
Apr 24 10:29:07 <lufimtse>	and then you have large icons and small text
Apr 24 10:29:13 <lufimtse>	looks funny
Apr 24 10:29:34 <akurtakov>	the patch I asked you is to test whether Monitor.getZoom returns correct value
Apr 24 10:29:44 <akurtakov>	in scaled and in non scaled way
Apr 24 10:29:49 <akurtakov>	there is attached snippet to the bug
Apr 24 10:37:13 <lufimtse>	my ui is kinda broken,

Apr 24 12:58:58 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what's the expected result?
Apr 24 12:59:11 <lufimtse>	Before/after patch, it prints 200 into the console
Apr 24 12:59:21 <lufimtse>	before patch, the text input shows 0
Apr 24 12:59:26 <lufimtse>	after patch, it shows '100'
Apr 24 12:59:39 <lufimtse>	I was still kinda expecting 100 & 200 of sort?
Apr 24 12:59:53 <akurtakov>	and after you change the scale of your monitor to 200%
Apr 24 13:00:04 <akurtakov>	and run the snippet it should show 200
Apr 24 13:00:29 <akurtakov>	100 or 200 should match your scale in gnome settings
Apr 24 13:00:57 <lufimtse>	Refresh - * stays at 100.
Apr 24 13:01:09 <lufimtse>	Refresh both * stays at 100-100
Apr 24 13:01:29 <akurtakov>	even after you have changed in gnome settings and you hit the button ?
Apr 24 13:01:45 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, can you type up a detailed description of how to test the patch?
Apr 24 13:01:49 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I'm kinda unclear
Apr 24 13:01:56 <lufimtse>	steps to take to test/verify
Apr 24 13:01:58 <lufimtse>	before and after
Apr 24 13:02:42 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: start the snippet
Apr 24 13:02:56 <akurtakov>	if your monitor is not scaled it should show 100
Apr 24 13:03:13 <akurtakov>	go in gnome settings and change the scale of the monitor
Apr 24 13:03:48 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, single monitor setup or multi monitor setup?
Apr 24 13:03:49 <akurtakov>	click the refresh button
Apr 24 13:04:07 <akurtakov>	it should show 200 on scaled monitor
Apr 24 13:04:10 <lufimtse>	which field should I be paying attention to?
Apr 24 13:04:18 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: it shouldn't matter as it's per monitor
Apr 24 13:04:41 <akurtakov>	look at the current
Apr 24 13:04:52 <akurtakov>	and move it between monitors and try
Apr 24 13:05:01 <lufimtse>	I tried that
Apr 24 13:05:03 <lufimtse>	stayed at 100
Apr 24 13:05:07 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 24 13:05:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: and the monitor scale was 200?
Apr 24 13:05:29 <lufimtse>	ericwill, akurtakov eric tested with a child eclipse
Apr 24 13:05:32 <lufimtse>	not the snippet afaik
Apr 24 13:05:37 <lufimtse>	ericwill, can you test with the snippet in the bug?
Apr 24 13:05:45 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, eric is afk
Apr 24 13:06:01 <lufimtse>	ericwill, snippet: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=480639#c14
Apr 24 13:08:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I tried with single/dual monitors, I set scale to 100 and to 200, tried restarting snippet and leave it running while changing dpi. At all times it shows 100, or 100 - 100.
Apr 24 13:08:24 <lufimtse>	In the gui, at no point does it show 200 as I would expect.
Apr 24 13:08:32 <lufimtse>	without the patch, it shows 0.
Apr 24 13:09:19 <akurtakov>	anything interesting about your system?
Apr 24 13:10:22 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmm
Apr 24 13:10:22 <akurtakov>	when single montior
Apr 24 13:10:28 <lufimtse>	well, 
Apr 24 13:10:41 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, It's a Mac Book Pro (non-touch bar) with Fedora 27 on it.
Apr 24 13:10:59 <lufimtse>	Wayland backend, but use X11 emulation for my eclipse.
Apr 24 13:11:25 <akurtakov>	so single monitor means - all the crap disconnected - aka barebone laptop?
Apr 24 13:12:18 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, it works on Eric's machine
Apr 24 13:12:46 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmm
Apr 24 13:12:47 <ericwill>	akurtakov tested with the snippet, works as expected on Wayland
Apr 24 13:13:21 <akurtakov>	if there is smth fishy it must be with monitor indexing
Apr 24 13:13:37 <akurtakov>	but if there is nothing else connected to the mac it should behave fine
Apr 24 13:14:22 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, making progress
Apr 24 13:14:24 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, sec
Apr 24 13:15:19 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah. I had Wayland as my Host backend, but was launching things with x11 emulation. 
Apr 24 13:15:27 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, with pure wayland/wayland, stuff works.
Apr 24 13:15:38 <akurtakov>	man
Apr 24 13:15:41 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, should I check how it works on pure x11/x11?
Apr 24 13:15:47 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: if you want
Apr 24 13:15:57 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, should it work on x11/x11 ?
Apr 24 13:16:06 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I don't see a reason why not
Apr 24 13:19:51 <ericwill>	akurtakov it doesn't work for me on X11 either
Apr 24 13:20:04 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so it seems that this functionality only works on wayland
Apr 24 13:20:16 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I think they added different dpi support across monitors on wayland
Apr 24 13:20:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: gnome runs on x11 too right?
Apr 24 13:20:21 <akurtakov>	aka no xwayland
Apr 24 13:20:26 <ericwill>	akurtakov yes, full gnome-xorg session
Apr 24 13:20:33 <akurtakov>	let me try 
Apr 24 13:20:38 <akurtakov>	I'll be back in a bit :)
Apr 24 13:20:50 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, full x11 with x11 doesn't work and     wayland on host with x11 emulation doesn't work
Apr 24 13:20:59 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, only wayland / wayland works.
Apr 24 13:21:06 <akurtakov>	the later is not interesting IMHO
Apr 24 13:21:20 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the later? wayland/wayland?
Apr 24 13:21:31 <akurtakov>	wayland on host with x11 emulation doesn't work
Apr 24 13:21:38 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, btw, I think they only added support for different dpi per monitor in wayland
Apr 24 13:21:48 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, yea, x11Emulation not so interest
Apr 24 13:21:53 <lufimtse>	interesting *
Apr 24 13:22:04 <lufimtse>	but should it work with x11/x11  on host and app?
Apr 24 13:22:06 <akurtakov>	well, different dpi per monitor ok
Apr 24 13:22:21 <akurtakov>	so it should scale all monitors at once
Apr 24 13:22:28 <lufimtse>	on x11 host, x11 snippet, dpi shows 100.
Apr 24 13:22:33 <lufimtse>	at all times
Apr 24 13:22:40 <lufimtse>	even if scale is 200%
Apr 24 13:22:41 <lufimtse>	btw
Apr 24 13:22:42 <lufimtse>	^
Apr 24 13:23:15 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok, so basically the snippet shows correct DPI only for wayland/wayland.
Apr 24 13:23:20 <lufimtse>	is that the desired result? 
Apr 24 13:23:35 <akurtakov>	let me see what is wrong for x11

Apr 24 13:30:11 <lufimtse>	https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/HiDpimon <
Apr 24 13:30:15 <lufimtse>	For Wayland, we have per-monitor scaling.

Apr 24 13:49:31 *	Now talking on #SWT
Apr 24 13:49:57 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, much better. Patch set 14 works well. I.e:
Apr 24 13:50:12 <lufimtse>	Wayland/wayland works proper (different dpi on different monitors)
Apr 24 13:50:18 <lufimtse>	x11/x11 works proper
Apr 24 13:50:37 <lufimtse>	wayland with xWayland also works if there is a single monitor, (dpi is proper, 100 or 200)
Apr 24 13:51:24 <lufimtse>	Only corner case is if you run gnome wayland, snippet with x11 backend on 2 monitors with different dpi. (then it shows 100). But I think this is expected since x11 didn't have different dpi per monitor 
Apr 24 13:51:31 <lufimtse>	I think we're good to merge
Apr 24 13:51:36 <lufimtse>	I'll leave feedback.
Apr 24 13:52:23 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: yeah, I totally think that xwayland with 2 monitors is a stretch 
Apr 24 13:52:44 <akurtakov>	we may even decide to try with non rectangular
Apr 24 13:52:47 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 24 13:53:30 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, for what it's worth, I have a setup like:
Apr 24 13:53:39 <lufimtse>	[mon1] [ mon2 ] [ mon 3]
Apr 24 13:53:49 <lufimtse>	.    [mon4]    #laptop screen underneath
Apr 24 13:54:12 <lufimtse>	but different dpi option doesn't show up with 4 screens
Apr 24 13:56:35 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, actually, scaling shows if resolution is above 1900
Apr 24 13:57:51 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, got things working with 4 displays with 1 being hi dpi
Apr 24 13:57:57 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the snippet self-adjusts 
Apr 24 13:58:04 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, as I move it between monitors
Apr 24 13:58:07 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, that's kinda cool.
Apr 24 14:01:44 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: good
Apr 24 14:01:50 <akurtakov>	I'm glad this moves 
Apr 24 14:01:57 <akurtakov>	I'm on single monitor only :)
Apr 24 14:22:05 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ericwill: so should we push it ?
Apr 24 14:43:10 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, yep

Apr 24 15:22:45 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I was quite impressed by snippet
Apr 24 15:22:53 <lufimtse>	that it auto-resizes when you move between monitors
Apr 24 15:22:59 <lufimtse>	that's very cool.
Apr 24 15:23:13 <lufimtse>	It'd be great to have eclipse auto-resize it self
Apr 24 15:23:15 <lufimtse>	also
Apr 24 15:23:31 <lufimtse>	It's nice to see that wayland is starting to become better than x11

Apr 27 10:47:18 <lufimtse>	the Browser wayland crash is perculiar. I've removed all webkit code (like 0 native calls), but the issue still occurs. It seems to occur on "new Webkit()" constructor, even without native code. If I comment out the webkit constructor, issue doesn't occur.
Apr 27 10:47:26 <lufimtse>	ericwill, when does accessibility kick in btw?
Apr 27 10:47:46 <lufimtse>	and is there a way for me to try to turn it off to see if it has an impact?
Apr 27 10:49:00 <ericwill>	lufimtse accessibility isn't on unless there is an assistive technology (like the screen reader) querying it
Apr 27 10:49:20 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I see
Apr 27 10:49:25 <lufimtse>	will dig deeper.
Apr 27 10:50:39 <ericwill>	lufimtse if you want to be sure you can revert my accessibility patches and try
Apr 27 10:50:48 <ericwill>	or just use 4.8 M2
Apr 27 10:50:58 <ericwill>	since the a11y work didn't get merged till M3
Apr 27 10:50:58 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I'm just exploring what could cause the issue
Apr 27 10:51:11 <lufimtse>	I might to a bisect to see if it occured in earlier versions
Apr 27 10:51:26 <lufimtse>	I.e, webkit isn't loaded, but crash occurs
Apr 27 10:51:29 <lufimtse>	it's perculiar
Apr 27 10:51:33 <ericwill>	yeah that's a good idea
