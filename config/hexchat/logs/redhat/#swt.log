Jul 27 11:58:48 *	Now talking on #swt
Jul 27 14:07:50 <ipun>	this may seem dumb, but is it correct to why my controlexample is running off of control.class now instead of .java?
Jul 27 14:08:40 <ipun>	my controlexample use to use the fontsize stuff that ive worked on, now its using control.class instead which i didnt touch
Jul 27 14:08:57 <ericwill>	the .class files are generated based on your changes from .java
Jul 27 14:09:11 <ericwill>	so unless you're changes aren't being reflected in the .class files you should be fine
Jul 27 14:09:19 <ericwill>	*your
Jul 27 14:13:57 <ipun>	hmm ok i might have to rebuild then thats probably the issue
Jul 27 14:14:52 <ericwill>	check the Java build path of your controlexample
Jul 27 14:15:01 <ericwill>	is the SWT project on the build path?
Jul 27 14:17:37 <ipun>	wierd enough i dont htink it is anymore...
Jul 27 15:03:46 <ipun>	ericwill looking at the commit, i copied over what its doing and its implementing it correctly with the font sizing
Jul 27 15:03:52 <ipun>	yet override_font() is still bugged
Jul 27 15:04:00 <ipun>	praying GTK looks at this seriously
Jul 27 15:04:11 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 27 15:04:17 <ericwill>	link to the commit?
Jul 27 15:07:49 <ipun>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=99c2423043f0c95a60093c618e00823e42e0ddfa
Jul 27 15:08:08 <ipun>	i implemented it the same way (to follow their way of doing it)
Jul 27 15:08:26 <ipun>	but i just realized this doesnt really have to do with override_font()
Jul 27 15:08:56 <ipun>	the guy just posted it since its just about how CSS is currently updated, but the override_font() i dont think has to do with this commit
Jul 27 15:08:59 <ericwill>	yeah so all that commit does is implement our thing
Jul 27 15:09:05 <ericwill>	i.e. convert from a pango unit to CSS
Jul 27 15:09:14 <ericwill>	which we already implemented :P
Jul 27 15:09:21 <ipun>	yup.
Jul 27 15:09:23 <ericwill>	would have been nice to know this earlier but oh well
Jul 27 15:09:47 <ipun>	sadly, i dont think we can use our code in the end =( since we're probably gonna have to use override_font() if its fixed
Jul 28 09:48:35 <ipun>	ericwill so far the comments on the GTK bug are not useful lol
Jul 28 09:48:49 <ericwill>	ipun yeah I just saw
Jul 28 09:48:59 <ipun>	not sure if Matt understands
Jul 28 09:49:18 <ericwill>	did Alex send you his Menu stuff?
Jul 28 09:50:30 <ipun>	no lemme msg him about that
Jul 28 09:52:52 <ericwill>	kk
Jul 28 10:09:11 <ipun>	should i move on to something else while i wait on GTK and alex?
Jul 28 10:09:25 <ipun>	cept my stack of things im dealing with is getting larger
Jul 28 10:13:18 <ericwill>	ipun I am going to ping them about the font thing
Jul 28 10:13:23 <ericwill>	since the comment wasn't really useful at all
Jul 28 10:14:40 <ipun>	yeah...
Jul 28 10:19:19 <ipun>	ericwill for the measured event loop bug, is this something that might be causing the signal call?
Jul 28 10:19:21 <ipun>	(GtkCellAllocCallback)get_cell_allocation
Jul 28 10:19:33 <ipun>	i forgot if we talked about that 
Jul 28 10:19:41 <ericwill>	ipun no, didn't see that
Jul 28 10:19:43 <ericwill>	looks likely
Jul 28 10:21:20 <ipun>	hmm okay. I looked deeper into that method but it doesnt have any explicit signals
Jul 28 10:21:47 <ericwill>	look in Display.initCallbacks() and see if there are any allocate callbacks
Jul 28 10:21:56 <ericwill>	also look in Tree and see there are any allocate callback methods
Jul 28 10:22:40 <ipun>	kk
Jul 28 10:32:42 <ericwill>	ipun send me the commit for that get_dpi thing
Jul 28 10:32:44 <ericwill>	from matt watson
Jul 28 10:33:04 <ipun>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=df08fc91bdc1d2e4c866122304fabe4dd298a7de
Jul 28 10:33:28 <ipun>	basically we need their override_font() to use that calculation
Jul 28 10:33:38 <ipun>	if we do that, it will fix it
Jul 28 10:33:49 <ericwill>	okay I think we are making progress
Jul 28 11:58:36 <ipun>	dispaly.initCallback has some callbacks like size_allocate
Jul 28 11:58:55 <ipun>	thats the only one though
Jul 28 12:02:05 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 28 12:04:23 <ipun>	ericwill: patch went out okay?
Jul 28 12:04:27 <ipun>	ill comment on the bug then
Jul 28 12:04:43 <ericwill>	ipun just commented lol, no need
Jul 28 12:04:46 <ipun>	okay
Jul 28 12:04:50 <ericwill>	we have a patch but I'm just waiting for him to commit it
Jul 28 12:05:37 <ipun>	how about on bugzilla?
Jul 28 12:08:39 <ericwill>	wait for the GTK bug to get fixed and then we can mark the Eclipse bug as fixed and link the commit
Jul 28 12:10:37 <ipun>	kk
Jul 28 13:57:25 <ericwill>	so that font bug is fixed and merged in GTK now
Jul 28 13:57:26 <ericwill>	all good
Jul 28 14:39:07 <ericwill>	ipun if you are ever bored/want something you don't have to think a lot about, make a bugzilla filter for all open SWT bugs and go through them
Jul 28 14:39:17 <ericwill>	close the ones which aren't relevant/can't reproduce
Jul 28 14:39:21 <ericwill>	to keep the BZ tidy
Jul 28 14:39:26 <ipun>	oaky
Jul 28 14:39:30 <ipun>	okay*
Jul 28 14:48:21 <ipun>	ericwill doesnt look like nulling the proc actually turns it off
Jul 28 14:57:22 <ericwill>	ipun hmm
Jul 28 14:57:30 <ericwill>	is there a method somewhere that destroys them or something?
Jul 28 15:05:01 <ipun>	ericwill theres a method called setEnabled from callback class, but i tried it and it doesnt seem to work
Jul 28 15:05:17 <ipun>	... wat
Jul 28 15:05:19 <ipun>	wait*
Jul 28 15:06:21 <ipun>	hahahaahah
Jul 28 15:06:26 <ipun>	it works
Jul 28 15:06:30 <ericwill>	okay :P
Jul 28 15:06:47 <ipun>	i just had to move the reenabling of it lower
Jul 28 15:06:53 <ipun>	lemme test around with it and we're good
Jul 28 15:57:16 <ipun>	hey lufimtse im still having issues compiling gtk for some reason with jhbuild... besides cancelling it and rebuilding again, did you find any other solution>
Jul 28 15:57:34 <lufimtse>	hey
Jul 28 16:18:48 <lufimtse>	ipun, what was the exact command we used again?
Jul 28 16:19:01 <lufimtse>	jhbuild buildone --force gtk+ ?
Jul 28 16:22:01 <ipun>	yeah thats it
Jul 28 16:25:09 <ericwill>	ipun please post on the platform-ui-dev mailing list and ask someone to review this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77096/
Jul 28 16:25:33 <ericwill>	ipun also take a look at this guy: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=493357
Jul 28 16:27:31 <ericwill>	I started work on that but I won't be able to finish it in time before I leave
Jul 28 16:27:55 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill I've updated the wiki: https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT/Devel/Gtk/jhbuild#Building_different_versions_of_gtk_.28or_compiling_your_changes.29
Jul 28 16:28:10 <lufimtse>	What you want is: 
Jul 28 16:28:10 <lufimtse>	 jhbuild buildone --force --no-network --distclean gtk+
Jul 28 16:28:25 <lufimtse>	the --distclean is especially needed if you go back to an older gtk version. 
Jul 28 16:28:45 <ipun>	it looks like someone broke a junit case in master
Jul 28 16:29:01 <lufimtse>	ipun, which one?
Jul 28 16:29:09 <ipun>	test_getPrinterList
Jul 28 16:29:20 <ipun>	unless its local
Jul 28 16:29:42 <lufimtse>	doesn't work on my system if I have a printer
Jul 28 16:29:53 <lufimtse>	stopped working somewhere in Gtk3.18
Jul 28 16:30:03 <ipun>	oh i see
Jul 28 16:30:04 <lufimtse>	I've been meaning to file a bug for it
Jul 28 16:30:11 <lufimtse>	maybe something for you to work on. 
Jul 28 16:30:13 <ipun>	ill ignore it for now
Jul 28 16:30:21 <lufimtse>	do you have a printer on your system?
Jul 28 16:30:34 <ipun>	ya
Jul 28 16:30:41 <ipun>	i just added it like a week ago though
Jul 28 16:33:45 <lufimtse>	that's probably why the jUnit fails
Jul 28 16:33:52 <lufimtse>	if you have time, feel free to investigate sometime
Jul 28 16:33:59 <lufimtse>	would be useful to have it fixed.
Jul 28 16:34:10 <lufimtse>	afaik it doesn't reproduce with gtk3.16 and before
Jul 28 16:34:13 <lufimtse>	so might be gtk bug.

Jul 29 11:38:32 <ipun>	lufimtse looks like the printerlist bug in our test case is really broken logic, techincally none of it shouldve passed
Jul 29 11:39:05 <lufimtse>	lol
Jul 29 15:28:33 <ipun>	ericwill should I be replacing all the gtk calls to that function to my private one? Im not sure if this is what we should do
Jul 29 15:28:58 <ericwill>	your private method is just a wrapper
Jul 29 15:29:01 <ericwill>	for the GTK call
Jul 29 15:29:07 <ericwill>	with the callback.setEnabled() in it
Jul 29 15:32:04 <ipun>	yeah i know, im just curious if its necessary to do that for every call that uses that function
Jul 29 15:32:19 <ericwill>	we should
Jul 29 15:32:39 <ericwill>	because if someone wants to use one of those methods in a measure event, the same bug will come up
Jul 29 15:33:48 <ipun>	oaky sounds good
Jul 29 15:34:18 <ipun>	i might have to implement it in Control and Widget as well, since Tree is a subclass of Control but Treeitem is a widget subclass
Jul 29 15:35:39 <ericwill>	ipun nah just do it in Control then
Jul 29 15:35:45 <ericwill>	sorry, widget
Jul 29 15:35:50 <ericwill>	all Controls are widgets
Jul 29 15:38:16 <ipun>	ah your right sorry i misread it 
Jul 29 16:29:25 <ipun>	ericwill how do you generate a new changeset number again? I tried pushing my changes but the changeset was closed already.
Jul 29 16:29:41 <ericwill>	before amending the commit, click the gerrit button in egit
Jul 29 16:29:50 <ericwill>	should give you something with multiple zeros
Jul 29 16:29:57 <ericwill>	copy and paste that and use it for your new change
Jul 29 16:32:15 <ipun>	nice thanks!

Aug 03 16:34:42 <ericwill>	check preferences
Aug 04 11:01:26 <ipun>	ericwill: for the setVisible bug you assigned me, seems like a GTK error. Documentation of gtk_window_get_position() says its really unaccurate and that its not 100% reliable
Aug 04 11:01:53 <ericwill>	ipun then close it as such with a link to the documentation

Aug 11 17:07:49 <ipun>	kk
Aug 12 09:14:43 <ericwill>	lufimtse hey...when you're around I have a question
Aug 12 09:58:47 <lufimtse>	ericwill, hullo
Aug 12 09:59:13 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I miss your company already X-D
Aug 12 09:59:24 <lufimtse>	wanted to complain about my landlady to you.
Aug 12 09:59:42 <ericwill>	haha yeah, working from home is kinda lonely
Aug 12 09:59:44 <ericwill>	the sleep is nice though
Aug 12 09:59:52 <ericwill>	what did your landlady do?
Aug 12 10:00:02 <lufimtse>	It's like when I was suggesting to you to use certain tools (emacs), she is suggesting me to organise my room in a certain way. Man she's driving me mad ^____^.
Aug 12 10:00:14 <lufimtse>	Boy I have learned
Aug 12 10:00:47 <ericwill>	lol, that seems like an odd thing for a landlady to be involved in -.-
Aug 12 10:04:19 <ericwill>	btw lufimtse I tested your sysdeps script...works very well
Aug 12 10:04:55 <ericwill>	might be useful to note that after using sysdeps, you can only use the build.sh once you've renamed your .classpath_gtk in the SWT git repo
Aug 12 10:05:39 <lufimtse>	I was thinking of fixing that up... hmmm
Aug 12 10:05:52 <lufimtse>	I could add a check?
Aug 12 10:06:35 <lufimtse>	like ask user "no .classpath found, would you like to copy .classpath_gtk to .classpath? [y/n]"
Aug 12 10:06:37 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Aug 12 10:08:06 <xipun>	wait lufimtse why is your landlady giving you pointers about your room
Aug 12 10:09:20 <lufimtse>	Some of the furniture is hers
Aug 12 10:09:41 <lufimtse>	We have a friendly relationship, but her micro-management is somewhat intense..
Aug 12 10:09:52 <lufimtse>	also I'm not that clean, she is a obsessive about cleaning
Aug 12 10:10:04 <lufimtse>	I have stuff lying around my room, kinda like on my desk.
Aug 12 10:10:18 <lufimtse>	she's like, "you should put the things you don't use into the garage"
Aug 12 10:10:25 <lufimtse>	me like "i'm quite happy with my room the way it is"
Aug 12 10:10:49 <lufimtse>	tensions eventually escalate, 
Aug 12 10:11:08 <lufimtse>	grr
Aug 12 10:11:14 <lufimtse>	need to let off some steam lol ^_^
Aug 12 10:11:32 <ericwill>	oh lols
Aug 12 10:11:38 <ericwill>	yeah that would be annoying
Aug 12 10:12:48 <ericwill>	lufimtse re: the sysdeps thing, you could check and print something, but offering to copy it makes the assumption that you've checked out the git repo already
Aug 12 10:12:55 <ericwill>	which is fine by me actually
Aug 12 10:13:41 <lufimtse>	good idea. 
Aug 12 10:13:56 <lufimtse>	very unintrusive
Aug 12 10:14:58 <ericwill>	I like the script, saved me a lot of time
Aug 12 10:17:08 <ericwill>	also lufimtse, did you by any chance document that bit about the "fetch from gerrit" menu missing? I ran into the same issue on my machine at home, can't remember how you got it to work
Aug 12 10:43:56 <lufimtse>	humms
Aug 12 10:44:39 <lufimtse>	not in public wiki, but let me check my private wiki

Aug 12 10:55:01 <ericwill>	lufimtse okay will try it out, thanks
Aug 12 11:04:22 <ericwill>	lufimtse hmm so all I needed to do was select the http option with no username
Aug 12 11:04:27 <ericwill>	i.e.: http://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git
Aug 12 11:04:39 <lufimtse>	let me check
Aug 12 11:05:01 <lufimtse>	ssh://lufimtsev@git.eclipse.org:29418/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git
Aug 12 11:05:06 <lufimtse>	avoid the 'gitroot' one
Aug 12 11:05:24 <lufimtse>	I also copied SSH keys to the right places
Aug 12 11:05:42 <lufimtse>	I keep my SSH key in my google drive and then copy it to my machine when needed
Aug 12 11:05:50 <lufimtse>	or generate new key and put to eclipse org
Aug 12 11:06:06 <ericwill>	ah okay
Aug 12 11:06:32 <lufimtse>	http://storage8.static.itmages.com/i/16/0812/h_1471014423_5798266_dffa5947e3.png
Aug 12 11:06:34 <lufimtse>	when I push
Aug 12 11:06:45 <lufimtse>	for review
Aug 12 11:07:01 <lufimtse>	you may have to tinker with .git/config
Aug 12 11:07:05 <lufimtse>	and stuff gerrit in there
Aug 12 11:07:13 <lufimtse>	do you need my copy of the .git/config?
Aug 12 11:07:25 <ericwill>	no no
Aug 12 11:07:31 <ericwill>	I copied the one from my work machine, seems to work
Aug 12 11:08:10 <ericwill>	also the ssh works for me now too, just had to remove gitroot from the URI
Aug 12 11:08:12 <ericwill>	all good
Aug 12 11:22:19 <lufimtse>	kewl
Aug 12 11:22:34 <lufimtse>	I should document it
Aug 12 11:22:48 <lufimtse>	originally you helped me with finding that one had to get rid of 'gitroot',
Aug 12 11:23:49 <ericwill>	yup
Aug 12 11:23:56 <ericwill>	and now I had totally forgotten it
Aug 12 11:24:04 <ericwill>	this is why it's important to document :P
Aug 12 11:38:45 <ericwill>	ipun is this for review? https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78969/
Aug 12 11:39:18 <ipun>	oh woops sorry i forgot to tag the WIP on it
Aug 12 11:39:23 <ipun>	im just running the tests on it now
Aug 12 11:39:26 <ericwill>	kk
Aug 12 11:40:16 <lufimtse>	After I push stage 1 of the webkit business, I'll tryina invest sometime into more documentation and blogging
Aug 12 11:40:36 <lufimtse>	I've been somewhat happy with my zim and been lazy about putting things into public wiki
Aug 12 11:40:47 <lufimtse>	:-3
Aug 12 11:40:54 <lufimtse>	I'm so bad.
Aug 12 11:42:51 <ipun>	lufimtse im having issues compiling eclipse after running your build script =(
Aug 12 11:43:04 <lufimtse>	X-D
Aug 12 11:43:08 <lufimtse>	let's investigate
Aug 12 11:43:59 <ericwill>	ipun are you by any chance getting: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.OS.setenv([B[BI)I
Aug 12 11:48:41 <ericwill>	lufimtse it looks like your commit yesterday to the build script broke something
Aug 12 11:48:46 <ericwill>	reverting it fixes it for me
Aug 12 11:58:47 <lufimtse>	it's the commit after my commit
Aug 12 11:58:51 <lufimtse>	sravan's changes to c.c
Aug 12 11:58:55 <lufimtse>	ericwill, 
Aug 12 11:58:59 <lufimtse>	Investigating
Aug 12 11:59:11 <lufimtse>	BUT FIRST
Aug 12 11:59:12 <ericwill>	hmm
Aug 12 11:59:13 <lufimtse>	Tea.
Aug 12 11:59:50 <ericwill>	okay makes sense actually
Aug 12 12:03:35 <lufimtse>	of course,
Aug 12 12:03:45 <lufimtse>	drinking tea before tacking a problem always makes sense.
Aug 12 12:04:31 <ericwill>	:D
Aug 12 12:07:41 <ipun>	well my patch works if rebased on a previous commit
Aug 12 12:07:48 <ipun>	tried on all versions, it looks good now
Aug 12 12:08:32 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill I'm investigating the setenv business, will post in bug or on dev-list
Aug 12 12:08:46 <ericwill>	kk
Aug 12 12:51:11 <lufimtse>	ericwill|lunch, ipun I figured it out. the first static initializer in OS.java calls OS.setenv(..) before the library is loaded.
Aug 12 13:25:54 <ericwill>	oh lord
Aug 12 13:25:58 <ericwill>	rebooted over lunch
Aug 12 13:26:05 <ericwill>	forgot I had removed my boot partition
Aug 12 13:26:07 <ericwill>	had to re-install grub
Aug 12 13:30:57 <ipun>	did you let svan know lufimtse ?
Aug 12 13:36:57 <ipun>	:qq
Aug 12 13:37:02 <ipun>	woops sorry
Aug 12 13:44:56 <lufimtse>	ipun, I posted in the bug, investigating fix.
Aug 12 14:51:27 <ericwill>	lufimtse are you okay with me merging that sysdeps thing?
Aug 12 15:03:32 <lufimtse>	sec
Aug 12 15:03:39 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I'm still adding the .class thing check
Aug 12 15:03:43 <lufimtse>	I wrote it, just need to push it.
Aug 12 15:03:56 <lufimtse>	twiddling with hi-dpi unsat.link error.
Aug 12 15:03:59 <lufimtse>	atm
Aug 12 15:04:06 <ericwill>	yeah that error is annoying
Aug 12 15:04:11 <ericwill>	I just reverted it locally
Aug 12 15:34:02 <lufimtse>	ericwill, ipun, I submitted a patch, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78989/
Aug 12 15:34:15 <lufimtse>	I'm awaiting Niraj or Sravan to review and push to master.
Aug 12 15:34:45 <ericwill>	lufimtse saw it, looks good from my end
Aug 12 15:34:52 <ericwill>	sadly they are in India and probably in bed already
Aug 12 15:34:56 <ericwill>	so we don't get a fix till Monday
Aug 12 15:35:00 <lufimtse>	If they haven't done it by monday evening, I'll just push it myself...

Aug 17 10:34:52 <ipun>	for bug 182598, Im wondering if I should close it as unfixed or not. This has to do with how SWT is handling listeners; basically the item is destroyed before a method in the callback is ran
Aug 17 10:35:06 <ipun>	im not entirely sure how to fix this
Aug 17 10:36:50 <ericwill>	ipun the item is destroyed before the callback?
Aug 17 10:36:58 <ipun>	yeah
Aug 17 10:37:52 <ipun>	it crashes at tree.setItemCount(1)
Aug 17 10:38:08 <ipun>	its during the second event trigger 
Aug 17 10:38:46 <ericwill>	where in setItemCount does it crash?
Aug 17 10:40:26 <ipun>	i cant actually tell. It offsets the process so its done later
Aug 17 10:40:59 <ipun>	running a debug through the method is fine, but once it leaves and trys to finish the rest of the app, it crashes
Aug 17 10:41:11 <ipun>	i also noticed changed it to setItemCount(2) works fine

Aug 29 11:55:41 <lufimtse>	ok
Aug 29 11:55:44 <lufimtse>	test hard my friend.

Aug 30 14:58:25 <ipun>	lufimtse hey i think i found the commit causing it through git blame, how do i switch to that exact commit again?
Aug 30 14:58:35 <ipun>	or is there a way to search git history?

Aug 30 15:12:29 <ipun>	yeah thats it
Aug 30 15:12:29 <lufimtse>	yea, seems like it.
Aug 30 15:12:33 <lufimtse>	I'm reading up on it.
Aug 30 15:16:23 <ipun>	sadly not very useful considering it has no commit message...
Aug 30 15:31:15 <lufimtse>	LD_LIBRARY_PATH/home/lufimtse/git/swt_dev_tools/gtk_builds/3.06
Aug 30 15:31:26 <lufimtse>	except lufimtse -> ipun
Aug 30 16:12:28 <lufimtse>	ipun, btw, to copy workspace across, I used:
Aug 30 16:12:29 <lufimtse>	rsync -avzh /home/lufimtse/workspace_neon/ ~/workspace
Aug 30 16:12:32 <lufimtse>	from host to vm
Aug 30 16:12:38 <lufimtse>	as per
Aug 30 16:12:39 <lufimtse>	http://www.tecmint.com/rsync-local-remote-file-synchronization-commands/
Aug 30 16:12:45 <lufimtse>	That way the vm uses a copy of the workspace
Aug 30 16:12:56 <lufimtse>	I just re-run the command to get a fresh copy of the workspace
Aug 30 16:13:15 <lufimtse>	the nice thing is that it just sync the changes, so it's fast if you have a big workspace. (mine is like 1.5 gb).
Aug 30 16:18:13 <ipun>	nice thanks! ive just basically copied over another workspace and renamed it somethjing else, but this definitely would be useful for syncing

Sep 01 10:54:24 <ericwill>	that comment is so useful
Sep 01 10:54:47 <ericwill>	if that ends up being true we should replace all instances of gdk_screen_get_monitor_at_window() with that
Sep 01 10:55:33 <ericwill>	that would fix https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=494771 as well
Sep 01 10:58:10 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 01 10:58:19 <lufimtse>	ipun, sup
Sep 01 10:58:48 <lufimtse>	ipun, change bug id in title, make a new change id
Sep 01 10:58:59 <lufimtse>	that should create new gerrit review.
Sep 01 11:17:19 <ipun>	ericwill thanks for the comment, that does indeed get the correct monitor
Sep 01 11:17:29 <ipun>	however, its still painting in the wrong place
Sep 01 11:17:33 <ipun>	working on finding why its doing that
Sep 01 11:18:00 <ericwill>	ipun look at ToolTip.drawTooltip()
Sep 01 11:38:30 <ipun>	have any of you guys had issues with eclipse causing your whole computer to slow down for like 2 minutes and crash
Sep 01 11:38:33 <ipun>	ive had that happen once in a while
Sep 01 11:41:32 <ericwill>	hmm
Sep 01 11:41:34 <ericwill>	nope
Sep 01 11:58:52 <ipun>	ericwill so i fixed it, but because of nonexistant documentation, i have no idea how
Sep 01 11:59:52 <ipun>	in configure () theres soooo many numbers that have no meaning
Sep 01 12:09:36 <ericwill>	ipun throw the patch onto gerrit I'll take a look
Sep 01 12:10:00 <ericwill>	oh god, looking at tooltip.configure()...
Sep 01 12:10:07 <ericwill>	what is happening here
Sep 01 12:10:38 <ericwill>	I don't think these numbers affect us, just the monitor bits
Sep 01 12:18:37 <ipun>	ericwill k i found out whats going on
Sep 01 12:18:42 <ipun>	its actually f rom configure()
Sep 01 12:18:46 <ipun>	i fixed it from there
Sep 01 12:18:56 <ipun>	i have an idea on how to fix, just needs some time

Sep 01 15:25:44 <ipun>	its annoying because GTK sees a certain monitor as 1 but its not primary in my setup
Sep 01 15:25:54 <ipun>	like, from the OS you can switch it
Sep 01 15:26:07 <ipun>	so now im trying to figure out how to get it working correctly
Sep 01 15:26:30 <ericwill>	yeah it's tricky

Sep 07 17:25:45 <lufimtse>	ipun, not afaik, but he seems to be on mattermost # Platform
Sep 08 12:13:23 <ipun>	lufimtse could you help me set up my gerrit for another repo im working on?
Sep 08 12:13:28 <ipun>	i forggot some of the steps
Sep 08 12:13:33 <lufimtse>	ipun, hey
Sep 08 12:13:34 <lufimtse>	sure
Sep 08 12:13:34 <lufimtse>	sec
Sep 08 12:25:01 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun looks like the SWT JUnit tests are broken on GTK3 for master
Sep 08 12:25:05 <ericwill>	can any of you confirm
Sep 08 12:27:21 <ericwill>	oh wait nvm
Sep 08 12:27:23 <ericwill>	I got it to work
Sep 08 12:27:26 <ericwill>	disregard :)
Sep 08 13:30:41 <lufimtse>	ericwill, :-3
Sep 08 13:31:15 <lufimtse>	I spoke with Stefan Xenos on Mattermost today, it was nice to actually be able to reach out and chat to other swt developers
Sep 08 13:31:31 <lufimtse>	too bad people don't seem to gravitate thowards freenode#swt
Sep 08 13:31:32 <lufimtse>	oh well.
Sep 08 13:41:54 <ericwill>	lufimtse yeah I'm going to download it today and check it out
Sep 08 14:08:51 <lufimtse>	kewl
Sep 08 14:09:22 <ipun>	whats next?
Sep 08 14:12:02 <ericwill>	ipun I sent you some emails
Sep 08 14:12:28 <ipun>	ericwill i gottem thanks! sorry i was asking "whats next" to leo
Sep 08 14:12:33 <ipun>	lufimtse^
Sep 08 14:12:37 <ericwill>	ipun ah lol, np
Sep 08 14:12:38 <ipun>	my eclipse has ded
Sep 08 14:22:28 <lufimtse>	@ipun, Guide on how to setup Eclipse to run nightly: https://coffeeorientedprogramming.com/2016/09/08/running-nightly-eclipse-for-the-impatient/
Sep 08 14:29:26 <ipun>	thank you!
Sep 08 14:31:58 <ericwill>	that's it for me today, talk to you guys later
Sep 08 14:32:03 <lufimtse>	ericwill, kk
Sep 08 14:32:07 <lufimtse>	have nice 1
Sep 08 14:32:14 <lufimtse>	ipun, lemme know if you get stuck somewhere
Sep 08 14:32:20 <ericwill>	lufimtse you too :)
Sep 08 14:32:32 <lufimtse>	you will need to download all the relevant 'mylyn' plugins (with gerrit integration)
Sep 08 14:32:55 <lufimtse>	Setting up a new workspace might not be a bad idea, to have a fresh start.
Sep 08 14:33:09 <lufimtse>	But the existing one should theoretically get the job done as well.
Sep 08 14:33:56 <ipun>	hokay
Sep 08 14:39:45 <ipun>	lufimtse which stuff from mylyn do i need?
Sep 08 14:40:01 <ipun>	klike
Sep 08 14:40:05 <ipun>	whats "relevent"
Sep 08 14:44:10 <ipun>	also im still having that same issue. I know eric and I figured it out a while back it had to do with some config file
Sep 08 15:14:55 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 08 15:15:06 <lufimtse>	lemme checks.
Sep 09 10:04:27 <ericwill>	morning ipun 
Sep 09 10:04:37 <ipun>	hello ericwill
Sep 09 10:05:34 <ericwill>	hello, looks like the focus patch got reverted
Sep 09 10:05:39 *	ericwill sighs
Sep 09 10:05:46 <ericwill>	you win some you lose some haha
Sep 09 10:06:06 <ipun>	i know =(
Sep 09 10:06:52 <ericwill>	looks like we need to start running the JFace tests at least once on patches
Sep 09 10:06:57 <ericwill>	which is annoying but necessary I suppose
Sep 09 10:07:11 <ipun>	lufimtse, would you be able to add that to your test script?
Sep 09 10:07:53 <ericwill>	I don't think so
Sep 09 10:08:01 <ericwill>	the test script is located in the SWT repo
Sep 09 10:08:35 <ericwill>	though maybe an optional "run jface tests too" flag/option could be added
Sep 09 10:13:54 <ipun>	yeah true
Sep 09 10:14:10 <ipun>	lemme try to fix the test suite stuff
Sep 09 10:14:28 <ericwill>	np
Sep 09 10:14:48 <ericwill>	might be worth it to write a bunch of test cases and put them into the SWT test suite too
Sep 09 10:24:17 <lufimtse>	ipun, ericwill, it's potentially possible to add jface stuff to the script.
Sep 09 10:24:29 <lufimtse>	the only thing it would take much much longer to execute
Sep 09 10:24:47 <ipun>	set it as a flag lufimtse 
Sep 09 10:24:49 <ericwill>	^
Sep 09 10:24:56 <ericwill>	-J or something
Sep 09 10:25:03 <lufimtse>	unless I make it so that it only runs one gtk version for jFace, and many for gtk
Sep 09 10:25:09 <ipun>	considering that it needs to be run anyways, running the thing on a VM would be the best
Sep 09 10:25:36 <lufimtse>	or a selector, which versions to test with jface, which versions to test with swt
Sep 09 10:26:03 <lufimtse>	From technical side, can be done. 
Sep 09 10:26:04 <ericwill>	lufimtse a selector sounds good. By default you could have it run the JFace tests with the same GTK3 version as the build machine
Sep 09 10:26:09 <ericwill>	(3.10 I think)
Sep 09 10:26:39 <lufimtse>	another option is to figure out how to run maven from command line, 
Sep 09 10:26:51 <lufimtse>	then run gtk_version_test && maven on jface
Sep 09 10:27:02 <lufimtse>	maven does testing
Sep 09 10:27:19 <lufimtse>	we can then pre-load LD_LIBRARY_PATH before maven runs
Sep 09 10:47:28 <ipun>	also ericwill, it kinda coordinates with how you told me the focus fix could have a test suite on it
Sep 09 10:48:00 <ericwill>	ipun yeah, now you can do the fix and add the test suites at the same time :)
Sep 09 11:19:13 <lufimtse>	ericwill, How do I test the project in here? : https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497812
Sep 09 11:19:22 <lufimtse>	I open child eclipse, but can't find any extra views
Sep 09 11:19:51 <ericwill>	lufimtse are you sure the new child eclipse is running with that plugin enabled?
Sep 09 11:21:55 <lufimtse>	Oh, I think it has some dependencies
Sep 09 11:22:03 <lufimtse>	org.eclipse.e4.core.di
Sep 09 11:22:04 <lufimtse>	meh
Sep 09 11:22:14 <lufimtse>	did you have to import those?
Sep 09 11:24:03 <lufimtse>	hmm, can't get the thing to work. Hmmmz
Sep 09 11:24:10 <ericwill>	I didn't run that project
Sep 09 11:24:43 <ericwill>	oh wait
Sep 09 11:24:45 *	ericwill checks
Sep 09 11:26:03 <lufimtse>	ericwill, oh, never mind
Sep 09 11:26:08 <lufimtse>	It's an RCP application
Sep 09 11:26:19 <lufimtse>	I went to com.vogella.eclipse.dndcontrols.product
Sep 09 11:26:25 <lufimtse>	clicked on "Launch an Eclipse application", 
Sep 09 11:26:28 <lufimtse>	snippet fired up.
Sep 09 11:26:39 <ericwill>	yes I just discovered this also lol
Sep 09 11:28:02 <ericwill>	lufimtse is that thing related to tracker/parts business?
Sep 09 11:28:07 <ericwill>	because the fix for that bug got merged already
Sep 09 11:28:31 <lufimtse>	No, but the fix contains instanceof
Sep 09 11:28:33 <lufimtse>	which is evil
Sep 09 11:29:06 <ericwill>	yeah I saw that
Sep 09 11:29:12 <ericwill>	I think in this case it is necessary though
Sep 09 11:29:38 <ericwill>	and since the instanceof is checking for Composite in Composite.java, I'm okay with it
Sep 09 11:30:08 <lufimtse>	Well, I beg to differ :-)
Sep 09 11:30:16 <lufimtse>	I'll submit a followup patch.
Sep 09 11:30:23 <ericwill>	what are your concerns?
Sep 09 11:31:53 <lufimtse>	Well, 
Sep 09 11:32:00 <lufimtse>	I'll submit patch, you'll see.
Sep 09 11:32:17 <ericwill>	ok
Sep 09 11:43:58 <ericwill>	lufimtse ah good call
Sep 09 11:44:01 <ericwill>	that patch looks good to me
Sep 09 11:44:04 <ericwill>	shall I merge?
Sep 09 11:47:00 <lufimtse>	Let's wait a day.
Sep 09 11:47:07 <lufimtse>	Then merge tomorrow if no objections.
Sep 09 11:47:15 <lufimtse>	Just to allow people to see it.
Sep 09 11:47:24 <lufimtse>	I'll followup on the bug.
Sep 09 11:47:34 <ericwill>	tomorrow is saturday :P
Sep 09 11:47:39 <ericwill>	also Monday is the code freeze for M2
Sep 09 11:47:50 <ericwill>	so if you want to wait that's fine but it will have to wait till M3
Sep 09 11:48:04 <lufimtse>	oh
Sep 09 11:48:10 <lufimtse>	thanks for pointing it out.
Sep 09 11:48:15 <lufimtse>	Hmmmmzzz
Sep 09 11:48:20 <ericwill>	I'm fine with waiting
Sep 09 11:48:22 <ericwill>	it's not urgen
Sep 09 11:48:25 <ericwill>	*urgent
Sep 09 11:48:35 <lufimtse>	Let's merge at 5pm today :-)
Sep 09 11:48:51 <ericwill>	okay you do it, I won't be on
Sep 09 11:49:03 <lufimtse>	ok, if you could +1 it...
Sep 09 11:49:06 <lufimtse>	that'd be great.
Sep 09 11:49:25 <lufimtse>	thanks for being on IRC.
Sep 09 11:49:29 <lufimtse>	~good karma.
Sep 09 11:49:59 <ericwill>	np haha
Sep 09 11:50:05 <ericwill>	good catch btw
Sep 09 11:50:12 <ericwill>	didn't think of markLayout()
Sep 09 11:52:43 <ipun>	ericwill when i run the Test_org_eclipse_swt_custom_Ccombo test it seems to pass
Sep 09 11:52:54 <ipun>	i wonder whats causing the null exception...
Sep 09 11:53:11 <ericwill>	ipun do the JFace tests fail for you locally?
Sep 09 11:53:35 <ipun>	ericwill im actually trying to figure our why none of my Jface tests are running right now ==
Sep 09 11:53:44 <lufimtse>	X-D
Sep 09 11:53:54 <lufimtse>	lemme knows if u need helpz
Sep 09 11:54:03 <ipun>	kk
Sep 09 11:54:03 <ericwill>	I mean, you gotta crawl before you can walk :D
Sep 09 12:20:01 <ipun>	ericwill lufimtse am i the only one getting failures in Jface from master branches?
Sep 09 12:20:47 <ericwill>	last time I checked a few weeks back I got some
Sep 09 12:28:22 <ipun>	hmm okay
Sep 09 12:31:17 <ipun>	ericwill i ran the jface stuff with my focus bug, doesnt seem to be a jface error =S i wonder whats causing that null exception
Sep 09 12:33:24 <ericwill>	ask Alex or lufimtse if they can reproduce the bug locally
Sep 09 12:33:47 <lufimtse>	meh?
Sep 09 12:33:50 <lufimtse>	what goes on
Sep 09 12:34:05 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun is having trouble reproducing a test failure on his machine
Sep 09 12:34:23 <lufimtse>	ericwill, do you know how the javadoc thing is constructed? is it physically using a tooltop or some browser?
Sep 09 12:34:35 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's a Browser widget
Sep 09 12:34:46 <ericwill>	it has nothing to with ToolTip.java
Sep 09 12:34:47 <lufimtse>	Do you know where to find the source?
Sep 09 12:35:06 <ericwill>	yeah it's in the JDT source code
Sep 09 12:35:20 <lufimtse>	ericwill, if it is not a tooltip, what is it? Is it a content assistant?
Sep 09 12:35:37 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's a Browser that's been shrunk down and renders HTML
Sep 09 12:35:51 <ericwill>	if you run a child eclipse and set a breakpoint in Browser.java you can see the stack trace
Sep 09 12:36:07 <lufimtse>	ah
Sep 09 12:36:22 <lufimtse>	but from a theoretical point of view, how would we call that thing?
Sep 09 12:36:30 <lufimtse>	that 'construct'?
Sep 09 12:36:37 <lufimtse>	it's not a tooltip, it's a .......
Sep 09 12:36:39 <lufimtse>	fill in dots
Sep 09 12:36:41 <ericwill>	I would call it a popup browser
Sep 09 12:36:55 <ericwill>	just like the quick outline is popup tree, etc.
Sep 09 12:37:49 <lufimtse>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window ?
Sep 09 12:37:55 <lufimtse>	I wanna argue with Dani mergerd
Sep 09 12:38:09 <lufimtse>	Megert*
Sep 09 12:38:46 <ericwill>	lufimtse it's not even a modal window because it doesn't prevent you from clicking the main Eclipse window while it's open
Sep 09 12:39:01 <ericwill>	it's literally a small widget that pops up and is clickable, and disappears if you click outside of it
Sep 09 12:39:10 <ericwill>	calling it a tooltip is just wrong lol
Sep 09 12:39:23 <lufimtse>	yea, I'm looking for a name to call it, would you refer to it as a modal_window?
Sep 09 12:39:40 <ericwill>	no
Sep 09 12:39:46 <ericwill>	modal windows disable the parent window
Sep 09 12:39:58 <ericwill>	the javadoc tooltip doesn't disable the parent Eclipse window while it's open
Sep 09 12:40:15 <lufimtse>	I see
Sep 09 12:40:15 <lufimtse>	hmm
Sep 09 12:40:38 <ipun>	lufimtse ill ask you about the errors later
Sep 09 12:40:44 <ipun>	doesnt seem to be happening on my machine or my VM
Sep 09 12:43:44 <ericwill>	lufimtse I would just argue to him that it's simply a small widget
Sep 09 12:43:55 <ericwill>	and that because of that it should at the very least have COLOR_WIDGET_* colors
Sep 09 12:44:05 <ericwill>	since it doesn't have any of the properties of a tooltip like I mentioned
Sep 09 12:46:12 <lufimtse>	ericwill, what color should it have?
Sep 09 12:46:54 <ericwill>	lufimtse it should have the same colors as a normal browser widget IMO
Sep 09 12:47:00 <ericwill>	so look in ControlExample
Sep 09 12:47:02 <ericwill>	whatever that is
Sep 09 12:47:24 <ericwill>	I think it's COLOR_WIDGET_BACKGROUND for the controls and COLOR_LIST_BACKGROUND for the content rendering area
Sep 09 12:49:42 <ericwill>	anyways lufimtse I have to run, we'll chat more next week
Sep 09 12:49:45 <ericwill>	have a good weekend :)
Sep 09 12:49:55 <lufimtse>	ericwill, thank you for feedback, have a nice one.
Sep 09 12:50:05 <lufimtse>	looking forward to having u back in office.
Sep 09 12:50:21 <ericwill>	lufimtse I know, me too. IRC is tedious -.-

Sep 09 15:01:39 <ipun>	hey lufimtse so i cant replicate the issue with the focus fix
Sep 09 15:01:54 <ipun>	not sure why, apparently it was erroring on the nightly

Sep 12 16:22:22 <ipun>	lufimtse: i realize right now date time works in a really wierd way when you do on click changes (typing it in on your own). Do you remmber any bug IDs that you worked on relating to it?
Sep 12 16:23:49 <lufimtse>	hey

Sep 12 16:26:29 <lufimtse>	Anatoly started the port, I finished it off.
Sep 12 16:26:41 <lufimtse>	It was the first SWT thing I worked on.
Sep 12 16:26:48 <ipun>	ah i see thank you
Sep 12 16:45:44 <ipun>	also lufimtse, i looked into this bug: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=197690
Sep 12 16:46:03 <ipun>	if you did a lot of work on date time, this might be easier for you to fix without disrupting too much of your logic
Sep 12 16:47:47 <ipun>	did you happen to touch anything with onNumberKeyInput()?
Sep 13 10:08:39 <ericwill>	morning gentlemen
Sep 13 10:11:29 <ipun>	morning gentlemen
Sep 13 10:13:40 <lufimtse>	It would be a while before I would get to it. I first have to resolve some DnD issues, then the webkit thing, then the wayland port etc.. 
Sep 13 10:14:06 <lufimtse>	if you want to work on something else, feel free to assign it to platform-swt-inbox and someday I might get to it.
Sep 13 10:14:49 <ericwill>	what's this?
Sep 13 10:15:37 <ipun>	wrong convo?
Sep 13 10:16:30 <ericwill>	lufimtse ?

Sep 13 10:32:43 <ericwill>	ipun okay
Sep 13 10:32:55 <ericwill>	ipun can you also write a JUnit test case for this bug?
Sep 13 10:33:22 <ipun>	okay
Sep 13 10:33:49 <ericwill>	you can put it in a separate gerrit
Sep 13 10:33:58 <ipun>	kk, part of same bug ID?
Sep 13 10:35:18 <ericwill>	yup
Sep 13 11:33:05 <ericwill>	ipun I'll review your patches sometime this week
Sep 13 11:33:11 <ericwill>	we can't merge anything till M2 is released
Sep 13 11:33:30 <ericwill>	aka Friday
Sep 13 11:53:16 <ipun>	kewl
Sep 13 11:53:29 <ipun>	ericwill im going to work on a bit of dark theme bugs in the time being
Sep 13 11:55:42 <ericwill>	ipun yeah that sounds fine :)
Sep 13 15:24:14 <ipun>	lufimtse, for one of my bugs im working on, it turns out that setBackground() is taking priority over css
Sep 13 15:24:21 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 13 15:24:30 <lufimtse>	which bugz
Sep 13 15:24:37 <lufimtse>	I'm working on Color of javadoc hover
Sep 13 15:24:44 <ipun>	it seems that after "refreshing" it (clicking a different tab, selecting it and dselcting it, etc) it fixes it
Sep 13 15:24:55 <ipun>	is there a method in control that refreshes?
Sep 13 15:25:31 <lufimtse>	meh?
Sep 13 15:25:38 <lufimtse>	What bugs u working on
Sep 13 15:26:15 <ipun>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=483789
Sep 13 15:26:50 <ipun>	like, for example, if you click on something it highlights it, meaning it overrites the color with a "highlight color"
Sep 13 15:27:02 <ipun>	once you remove the highlight (deselect), it refreshes it
Sep 13 15:27:05 <ipun>	thast just one example
Sep 13 15:28:35 <lufimtse>	Do you get that behavoiur in pure swt?
Sep 13 15:28:42 <lufimtse>	it's possible that platform UI messes with colours
Sep 13 15:29:23 <ipun>	i havent played with that in SWT no
Sep 13 15:37:18 <ipun>	actaully i think i know the issue. It seems that its directly overriting the css since it uses setBackgroundColor
Sep 13 15:37:37 <ipun>	i wonder if theres a way to see if it is using a theme
Sep 13 15:38:18 <ipun>	ill ask
Sep 14 10:26:49 <ipun>	hey lufimtse, i had to do some cleaning on my workspace, and i forgot where in the run configuations do i set it so it runs my code for platform.ui
Sep 14 10:26:58 <ipun>	that is if i was running a child elcipse

Sep 15 11:11:16 <ericwill>	no, it's another Eclipse project
Sep 15 11:11:47 <ericwill>	you can find it at git.eclipse.org/c

Sep 16 11:31:10 <ipun>	hey
Sep 16 11:31:49 <ipun>	ericwill for isDisposed(), its annoying cause I cant reproduce it im not quite sure where its hitting this problem 
Sep 16 11:32:31 <ipun>	its defs going to be a item.isDisposed() condition, im just not exactly sure what exactly it should return if it is disposed
Sep 16 11:34:01 <ericwill>	ipun probably throw the error that the javadocs says
Sep 16 11:34:16 <ericwill>	or return the topItem at index 0
Sep 16 11:34:29 <ericwill>	you'll have to investigate and see
Sep 16 11:34:42 <ericwill>	btw I posted comments on that focus bug, other than those comments it's good to go

Sep 19 14:03:54 <lufimtse>	does git blame says so?
Sep 19 14:04:05 <lufimtse>	looks vaguley familiar
Sep 19 14:04:54 <ipun>	yeah it does, but its pretty nested so im not sure if you were the original writer of that method or if you did the refactoring

Sep 20 10:37:11 <ipun>	yup
Sep 20 10:43:17 <ericwill>	hello hello
Sep 20 11:10:50 <ericwill>	lufimtse hey, can you do a pull on SWT master and see if your build.sh script works?
Sep 20 11:15:00 <ericwill>	for some reason it gives me "cd: /home/ericwill/git/eclipse.platform.swt/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/bin/library"
Sep 20 11:35:40 <ericwill>	ah nvm I figured it out
Sep 20 11:35:47 <ericwill>	you have to remove a missing entry from the SWT build path
Sep 20 11:35:57 <ericwill>	one of Alex's fixes removed something
Sep 20 11:36:03 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun ^
Sep 20 11:36:29 <ipun>	thanks bro
Sep 20 12:33:51 <ipun>	so
Sep 20 12:33:53 <ipun>	lufimtse...
Sep 20 14:48:41 <ericwill>	lufimtse I wrote a python script that parses os_custom.h, fetches the list of deprecated functions in GTK, and compares to see if any dynamic functions are deprecated
Sep 20 14:48:52 <ericwill>	...there are quite a few it seems
Sep 20 14:49:13 <ericwill>	and we never see that they're deprecated since they never run through the compiler
Sep 20 14:55:52 <ipun>	 thanks ericwill

Oct 04 11:19:39 <ipun>	lufimtse ericwill, just relaying some stuff i dissected through debugging wayland. You can just set Enviro Variable of GDK_BACKEND to 'wayland' or 'X11' for any runtime configurations 
Oct 04 11:19:50 <ipun>	i would blog about it if i had a blog
Oct 04 11:20:19 <lufimtse>	hey
Oct 04 11:20:47 <lufimtse>	That's very useful to know
Oct 04 11:21:00 <ericwill>	lufimtse ipun it would be cool if we could compile a list of GTK specific environment variables somewhere
Oct 04 11:21:04 <ericwill>	maybe the wiki?
Oct 04 11:21:16 <ipun>	yeah that be cool
Oct 04 11:21:19 <ipun>	cept thats the only one i know 
Oct 04 11:21:21 <ericwill>	things like USE_CAIRO, GDK_BACKEND, etc.
Oct 04 11:22:11 <lufimtse>	ipun, consider starting a blog (e.g wordpress?). Or if you want I could give you contributor rights to my blog on coffeeorientedprogramming
Oct 04 11:22:31 <ipun>	maybe ill do a wordpress.
Oct 04 11:23:06 <ipun>	i got to do a whole bunch a crap this week with FSSOS so I might as well do a wordpress as well 
Oct 04 11:24:13 <ericwill>	are both of you guys going to FSOSS or just you ipun 
Oct 04 11:24:29 <ipun>	im not sure about lufimtse but im going and presenting
Oct 04 11:24:52 <lufimtse>	when/where is FSOSS again?
Oct 04 11:24:58 <ipun>	York Uni
Oct 04 11:25:28 <ericwill>	lufimtse how did your CSC209 lecture go?
Oct 04 11:25:36 <lufimtse>	good good.  Lots of curious faces.
Oct 04 11:25:41 <lufimtse>	have one more next week.
Oct 04 11:25:49 <lufimtse>	first one was on open source
Oct 04 11:25:58 <lufimtse>	next one will be on Tools for C development.
Oct 04 11:26:36 <ericwill>	cool
Oct 04 11:27:16 <ipun>	nice i love visual studio
Oct 04 11:27:33 <ipun>	praise M$
Oct 04 11:28:14 <ericwill>	haha
Oct 04 11:28:29 <ericwill>	lufimtse signed my paperwork for full time btw :)
Oct 04 11:49:45 <lufimtse>	ericwill, Congrats :-D!
Oct 04 11:49:56 <lufimtse>	ipun, the CSC209 prof loves visual studi
Oct 04 11:50:04 <lufimtse>	she says it's the best ide for C development.
Oct 04 11:50:30 <lufimtse>	"and neccessary to succeed in life"
Oct 04 11:50:33 <lufimtse>	lol,
Oct 04 11:51:06 *	ericwill shakes head
Oct 04 11:51:10 <ipun>	does she even notepad
Oct 04 11:52:03 <ericwill>	lufimtse thanks, can't wait till May
Oct 04 11:52:07 <ericwill>	university is annoying :P
Oct 04 11:52:22 <lufimtse>	:-P
Oct 04 12:13:59 <ericwill>	lufimtse I triaged the SWT critical bugs down to 11 bugs
Oct 04 12:14:11 <lufimtse>	X-D, omg
Oct 04 12:14:12 <ericwill>	which is more manageable, the ones left are all reproducible
Oct 04 12:14:23 <lufimtse>	very nice
Oct 04 12:14:53 <lufimtse>	If you could send your status report before 11 am on wednesday, I'd mention that on your behalf.
Oct 04 12:15:09 <ericwill>	sure, will do :)
Oct 04 12:20:00 <ericwill>	time to run, see you guys later!

Oct 05 15:31:17 <ipun>	lufimtse, the performance issues shouldnt be caused by the theming, as my snippet (no theming engine) is doing the same thing
Oct 05 15:31:30 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 05 15:33:22 <ipun>	honestly very likely a listener issue
Oct 05 15:33:32 <ipun>	im going to try to diagnose it now
Oct 05 15:33:50 <ipun>	considering its 3pm in toronto, ill be here for awhile D=
Oct 05 16:04:11 <ipun>	also lufimtse i got my snippets running correctly, but even after putting my swt source in the build path its still using the onboard SWT
Oct 05 16:06:36 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 05 16:06:49 <lufimtse>	you need to change properties
Oct 05 16:06:52 <lufimtse>	in snippet project
Oct 05 16:06:57 <lufimtse>	to use SWT project
Oct 05 16:07:25 <lufimtse>	properties -> Java build path -> projects
Oct 05 16:07:31 <lufimtse>	add swt project in there.
Oct 05 16:09:45 <ipun>	i did, no change
Oct 05 16:10:26 <ipun>	ill try restarting it
Oct 05 16:10:33 <ipun>	did a clean -> build as well
Oct 05 16:12:42 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 05 16:13:04 <lufimtse>	maybe change the "order and Export"
Oct 05 16:13:08 <lufimtse>	move swt project up
Oct 05 16:13:32 <ipun>	did that already
Oct 05 16:13:47 <ipun>	when i debug a swt snippet which goes into SWT source, it says source not found
Oct 05 16:14:15 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 05 16:14:27 <lufimtse>	can you find some tool with which I can remote connect to your system?
Oct 05 16:14:42 <lufimtse>	I could try to remote-debug :--)
Oct 05 16:14:58 <ipun>	sure
Oct 05 16:15:03 <ipun>	lemme play with it a little long
Oct 05 16:15:05 <ipun>	longer*
Oct 05 16:15:10 <ipun>	worst case teamviewer?
Oct 05 16:20:47 <ipun>	lufimtse install teamviewer for me for now, i am too lazy to find a FSOSS option
Oct 05 16:28:58 <ipun>	yeah i still cant get it done. even under run configurations org.eclipse.swt is there for source/build path, yet it cant find anything during runtime
Oct 05 16:32:23 <ipun>	k nvm
Oct 05 17:07:27 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 05 17:08:19 <lufimtse>	Can you try to find something FSOSS? We could re-use it for other people also, (e.g Eric)... Maybe ask on red hat tech list about it?
Oct 05 17:08:28 <lufimtse>	Someone's bound to know some tool.
Oct 05 17:09:09 <lufimtse>	I'll be back tomorrow.

Oct 06 14:59:14 <ipun>	hey lufimtse good news, i thnk i found out whats causing the delay with ctab folders
Oct 06 14:59:32 <ipun>	which also might link to issues with ctabfolders in eclipse being put somewhere else when clicked
Oct 06 14:59:41 <lufimtse>	?
Oct 06 14:59:43 <ipun>	something with the listener Swt.DragDetect is busted
Oct 06 14:59:51 <lufimtse>	Could be
Oct 06 15:00:02 <lufimtse>	In one of my fixes, I implemented a timer that waits for a short time.
Oct 06 15:00:05 <ipun>	when i comment it out in CtabFolder, it runs normally
Oct 06 15:00:07 <lufimtse>	I wonder if that's to blame.
Oct 06 15:00:10 <ipun>	im not sure
Oct 06 15:00:14 <ipun>	whats the commit for that?
Oct 06 15:00:19 <lufimtse>	bleh, 
Oct 06 15:00:20 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 06 15:00:29 <lufimtse>	that was a while ago..
Oct 06 15:00:30 <ipun>	but the timer doesnt occur in X11, this issue only happens in wayland
Oct 06 15:00:36 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 06 15:00:44 <lufimtse>	I gotta checks. Hold on. 
Oct 06 15:02:26 <lufimtse>	git log show d75a51833886fedc47fd1992d6bcd02c341104d6
Oct 06 15:02:38 <lufimtse>	try to dissable that timer, see if that makes a difference
Oct 06 15:03:02 <lufimtse>	My fix for DnD is a bit of a hack. 
Oct 06 15:03:15 <lufimtse>	It was done in my early days :-)
Oct 06 15:03:51 <lufimtse>	I should ideally re-work that patch someday
Oct 06 15:06:57 <ipun>	'someday'
Oct 06 15:07:57 <ipun>	also there isnt any stable tiling manager for wayland yet
Oct 06 15:08:14 <ipun>	tried one called Sway, doesnt work very well so im not resorting to gnome for weayland testing
Oct 06 15:12:02 <ipun>	okay, so it looks like dragDetect gets triggered on CTabFolder only in wayland 
Oct 06 15:12:05 <ipun>	this is good, im getting somewhere
Oct 06 15:18:02 <ipun>	when you have time, could you explain your reasoning on the timer? and pehaps where the method/logic is set for how SWT know this is a dragDetect event?
Oct 06 15:18:14 <ipun>	lemme know here im going to lunch
Oct 06 15:23:18 <lufimtse>	ok
Oct 06 15:23:25 <lufimtse>	the comment kinda outlinesi t.
Oct 06 15:23:27 <lufimtse>	outlines it
Oct 06 15:25:12 <lufimtse>	as a note, you might have to update your jhbuild someday

Oct 07 14:31:20 <ipun>	lufimtse so i found out where the bug is, and it is going to fix the drag + drop issue and also the lag
Oct 07 14:31:26 <lufimtse>	hey
Oct 07 14:31:27 <ipun>	however, i am not sure how to approach it.
Oct 07 14:31:46 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 07 14:31:49 <lufimtse>	so the timer thing
Oct 07 14:31:52 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 07 14:31:53 <ipun>	wyes
Oct 07 14:31:55 <ipun>	but 
Oct 07 14:31:58 <lufimtse>	we should set up some verbal chat system
Oct 07 14:32:00 <lufimtse>	meh
Oct 07 14:32:01 <ipun>	its not the timers problem
Oct 07 14:32:01 <lufimtse>	ok, let
Oct 07 14:32:04 <lufimtse>	timer
Oct 07 14:32:05 <lufimtse>	soo
Oct 07 14:32:09 <lufimtse>	the thing about gtk3
Oct 07 14:32:19 <lufimtse>	is that it stopped sending events when mouse moves in dnd
Oct 07 14:32:23 <lufimtse>	for some reason
Oct 07 14:32:29 <lufimtse>	(I should investigate that..)
Oct 07 14:32:35 <lufimtse>	so DnD stopped working
Oct 07 14:32:40 <lufimtse>	because it relied on motion events
Oct 07 14:32:46 <lufimtse>	so
Oct 07 14:32:55 <lufimtse>	I set a timer, that checks for motion every 50 ms
Oct 07 14:33:02 <lufimtse>	it checks for motion by checking mouse position.
Oct 07 14:33:07 <lufimtse>	manually
Oct 07 14:33:11 <lufimtse>	thus the timer
Oct 07 14:33:16 <lufimtse>	it's a hacky solution
Oct 07 14:33:22 <lufimtse>	my early works... 
Oct 07 14:33:27 <lufimtse>	>__>
Oct 07 14:33:31 <lufimtse>	but worked so far.
Oct 07 14:33:37 <ipun>	ah yes its this call right/
Oct 07 14:33:39 <ipun>	gtk_drag_check_threshold
Oct 07 14:33:46 <lufimtse>	<__<
Oct 07 14:33:51 <lufimtse>	^__^
Oct 07 14:33:57 <ipun>	anyways
Oct 07 14:33:58 <lufimtse>	hack comes back to bite me. 
Oct 07 14:33:58 <ipun>	its not your fault
Oct 07 14:34:05 <ipun>	theres still an issue 
Oct 07 14:34:25 <ipun>	basically, the reason why the timer is set off in Wayland is that gdk_event_get() is not returning anything
Oct 07 14:34:39 <ipun>	AND, using your hack, it doesnt notice any drag 
Oct 07 14:34:40 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 07 14:34:43 <ipun>	but
Oct 07 14:35:16 <ipun>	theres a condition that if event == 0 still, return dragOnTimeout, which is true for some reason
Oct 07 14:35:51 <ipun>	but the main issue i think is that gdk_event_get() is not returning anything on a mouse down 
Oct 07 14:36:20 <ipun>	which is why i am thinking this is a GTK bug? but I am not sure if thats true or not, as  idont know how to replicate this on GTk 
Oct 07 14:36:31 <ipun>	consdering how complex this method is being used 
Oct 07 14:39:34 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 07 14:39:49 <lufimtse>	by not return anything you mean it get's stuck or returns null?
Oct 07 14:40:07 <ipun>	returns 0
Oct 07 14:40:30 <ipun>	in X11, it returns an event, thats why cTabFolder moves away from the timeout
Oct 07 14:40:53 <ipun>	however in wayland, no event is returned, so it falls into the timeout loop (500ms) and
Oct 07 14:41:02 <ipun>	somehow defaults to it being "dragged"
Oct 07 14:41:15 <ipun>	which causes eclipse when clicking around tabs to think im dragging them
Oct 07 14:41:51 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 07 14:41:53 <ipun>	this is all in control.java line 2475
Oct 07 14:41:55 <lufimtse>	lemme read some code
Oct 07 14:41:58 <ipun>	kk
Oct 07 14:48:33 <ipun>	i fixed the timeout issue i think, but im trying tofix the drag and drop bug
Oct 07 14:48:44 <ipun>	in line 2509, you had an if condition about dragging
Oct 07 14:49:15 <ipun>	i removed the condition and just made it break instead
Oct 07 14:49:30 <ipun>	i tested it on eclipse anddrag and drop seems to still work for now

Oct 07 14:51:55 <lufimtse>	interesting
Oct 07 14:53:25 <lufimtse>	I think the if (dragging) break; is needed for dragging to start 'early' enough
Oct 07 14:53:38 <lufimtse>	otherwise DnD might only start after 500ms
Oct 07 14:55:36 <lufimtse>	For patches, add me as reviewer :-)
Oct 07 14:56:55 <ipun>	okay
Oct 07 15:00:47 <ipun>	im more confused about the dragOnTimeout garbage, this seemed to be added a while back (not by you)
Oct 07 15:00:49 <ipun>	causing errors
Oct 07 15:01:20 <ipun>	that, or this could be a gdk_event_get bug
Oct 07 15:01:34 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 07 15:01:46 <ipun>	but your saying that your fix as because events in gtk3 dont always populate?
Oct 07 15:02:18 <lufimtse>	Well, gtk3 stopped sending motion events during DnD
Oct 07 15:02:20 <lufimtse>	not sure when
Oct 07 15:02:34 <lufimtse>	Given what I know now, I'd have bisected it to find the gtk version that introduced the change.
Oct 07 15:02:47 <lufimtse>	At the time I didn't even know how to compile gtk
Oct 07 15:02:58 <ipun>	hmm okay
Oct 07 15:22:48 <ipun>	im going to work on it a bit more, do you think its applicable to do somtehing like, if (wayland)?

Oct 18 10:00:42 <ericwill>	ipun what are you working on these days
Oct 18 10:00:46 <ericwill>	wayland stuff?
Oct 18 10:04:05 <ipun>	yeah
Oct 18 10:04:11 <ipun>	its a pain
Oct 18 10:06:58 <ipun>	ericwill theres an issue with cTab in wayland where it thinks its drag and dropping
Oct 18 10:07:02 <ipun>	everytime you click on it
Oct 18 10:07:16 <ipun>	i found the problem im just trying to diagnose if its GTK or us
Oct 18 10:07:38 <ipun>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=503431
Oct 18 10:18:27 <ericwill>	ipun ah yeah
Oct 18 10:18:33 <ericwill>	lots of Wayland work to be done I am sure
Oct 18 10:20:08 <ipun>	mmhm
Oct 18 10:36:05 <ericwill>	lufimtse http://www.eclipse.org/swt/triage.php
Oct 18 11:02:44 <ipun>	lufimtse: played around with using different GTK versions to see if i can get it running, looks like GTK2 works 
Oct 18 11:02:50 <ipun>	but im not sure if GTK2 even supports wayland
Oct 18 11:03:00 <lufimtse>	:-)
Oct 18 11:03:04 <ipun>	considering i cant use GTK inspector, im not sure if my snippet is running in wayland or just defaulted to x11
Oct 18 11:03:07 <lufimtse>	Gtk2 has no wayland support.
Oct 18 11:03:12 <ipun>	ah.
Oct 18 11:03:15 <ipun>	hm.
Oct 18 11:03:20 <lufimtse>	Waynand was not around back then.
Oct 18 11:07:54 <ipun>	well, this annoys me.
Oct 18 11:08:24 <ericwill>	ipun this is what makes Wayland work more tricky
Oct 18 11:08:54 <ipun>	i cant replicate gdk_event_get() behavior on a GTK snippet which annoys me even more
Oct 18 11:09:28 <lufimtse>	Interesting... 
Oct 18 11:09:30 <ipun>	i have a good feeling its a GTK problem but its taking me some time to prove it
Oct 18 11:14:40 <ericwill>	this is interesting: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=78971
Oct 18 12:17:45 <ipun>	lufimtse ericwill, i dont actualyl think gdk_event_get() has been updated to work with wayland
Oct 18 12:17:58 <lufimtse>	hey
Oct 18 12:18:02 <ipun>	older references about gdk_event_get imply it works on X servers
Oct 18 12:18:17 <ipun>	but, doing some git blame the method calls behind it hasnt been updated for many years now
Oct 18 12:19:26 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 18 12:20:28 <lufimtse>	ipun, checkout display.java:826
Oct 18 12:20:35 <lufimtse>	checkIfEventProc(...)
Oct 18 12:20:40 <lufimtse>	line 835
Oct 18 12:20:46 <lufimtse>	and 836
Oct 18 12:21:04 <lufimtse>	if (window == 0) return 0;
Oct 18 12:21:11 <lufimtse>	Try removing that line.
Oct 18 12:21:12 <ipun>	hmmmm....
Oct 18 12:21:14 <ipun>	oaky
Oct 18 12:21:14 <lufimtse>	See woot happens.
Oct 18 12:21:36 <lufimtse>	Does that code run on regular gtk3?
Oct 18 12:21:44 <lufimtse>	Does it even initiate on Wayland?
Oct 18 12:22:06 <ipun>	checkEventProc only runs in X11
Oct 18 12:22:13 <ipun>	neverr gets called in Wayland
Oct 18 12:24:04 <lufimtse>	I think it's a callback
Oct 18 12:24:18 <ipun>	as in?
Oct 18 12:24:18 <lufimtse>	related to expose flashing.
Oct 18 12:24:28 <lufimtse>	expose event I think is when widget is 'visible' to user
Oct 18 12:24:33 <lufimtse>	or visibility changes.
Oct 18 12:24:34 <lufimtse>	hmmmmmmmmmmmm
Oct 18 12:24:52 <lufimtse>	What if you comment out the content of that call and run in X11, does the same issue occur?
Oct 18 12:25:06 <lufimtse>	or dose it magically work well on X11 still
Oct 18 12:25:57 <lufimtse>	Also, does the native GTK snippet work on Gtk3, but not on Wayland, or not work in any situation? 
Oct 18 12:26:30 <ipun>	commetning out the contents leads to it working in X11 still
Oct 18 12:26:49 <ipun>	the proble, with the GTK snippet is that i cant get gdk_event_get() to work correctly in both wayland and X11
Oct 18 12:26:55 <ipun>	its not getting any events in the first place
Oct 18 12:27:09 <ipun>	when i run it it returns null even with a while loop timeout
Oct 18 12:29:10 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 18 12:29:11 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 18 12:29:33 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Oct 18 12:29:47 <ipun>	from the looks of how SWT implements it, it doesnt seem to do any hacky "gdk_put_event()" stuff
Oct 18 12:29:57 <ipun>	so that event shouldve been generated from GTK, which it didnt
Oct 18 12:30:17 <lufimtse>	I found I had similar issue with DnD
Oct 18 12:30:25 <lufimtse>	the motion event was no longer being generated.
Oct 18 12:30:41 <lufimtse>	I should have drilled down to native Gtk level. Instead I implemented DnD on java level
Oct 18 12:30:46 <lufimtse>	lol
Oct 18 12:30:48 <lufimtse>	X-D
Oct 18 12:30:57 <lufimtse>	that was on Gtk3
Oct 18 12:31:06 <lufimtse>	Try with Gtk3.6
Oct 18 12:31:08 <lufimtse>	or Gtk3.3
Oct 18 12:31:10 <lufimtse>	or Gtk3.4
Oct 18 12:31:16 <lufimtse>	I mean the native snippet... 
Oct 18 12:31:29 <lufimtse>	I wonder if something broke going up from older versions
Oct 18 12:31:31 <ipun>	yeah motion isnt being geenrated iether
Oct 18 12:31:44 <lufimtse>	Do other events get generated?
Oct 18 12:31:46 <lufimtse>	like expose?
Oct 18 12:31:51 <ipun>	i havent tested
Oct 18 12:31:58 <lufimtse>	Maybe get it to work for some events
Oct 18 12:32:03 <lufimtse>	like once we know and love
Oct 18 12:32:06 <lufimtse>	like button down
Oct 18 12:32:12 <lufimtse>	and mouse movement events
Oct 18 12:32:13 <ipun>	currently from my swt snippet, X11 generates motion and gtk_button_release
Oct 18 12:32:28 <lufimtse>	what about movement events while button not pressed.
Oct 18 12:32:34 <ipun>	doesnt seem so 
Oct 18 12:32:42 <lufimtse>	does it work on gtk2?
Oct 18 12:32:46 <ipun>	the movement event seems to generate on x11 when im not clicking on it 
Oct 18 12:33:22 <lufimtse>	sekunde... 
Oct 18 12:43:14 <lufimtse>		while (*JsCallFinished == FALSE) {
Oct 18 12:43:14 <lufimtse>			g_main_context_iteration(0, FALSE);
Oct 18 12:43:14 <lufimtse>		}

Oct 19 14:10:02 <ipun>	lufimtse my fix seems to fix the issue + have D&D working
Oct 19 14:11:49 <ipun>	but, it still relies on MOTION_NOTIFY instead of the click event
Oct 19 14:31:14 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 19 14:31:19 <lufimtse>	we kinda want motion notify
Oct 19 14:31:35 <lufimtse>	I wrote the fix because motion notify wasn't being sent
Oct 19 14:31:52 <lufimtse>	take my fix out. Should fix dnd 
Oct 19 14:32:08 <lufimtse>	add mainloop read thing
Oct 19 14:32:23 <lufimtse>	oh, you mean instead*
Oct 19 14:32:24 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 19 14:32:42 <lufimtse>	so u not getting button release at all?
Oct 20 09:56:22 <ipun>	lufimtse, it seems that running g_main_context_iteration () processes the events, but then the vents dont show up in event_get anymore
Oct 20 09:56:43 <ipun>	and i cant seem to find a way to grab the even that is being processed by g_main_context_iteration

Oct 20 11:51:28 <ipun>	lufimtse ping got a question for you
Oct 20 11:51:56 <ipun>	im thinking about mergig gtk_button_press_event with _release_event
Oct 20 11:52:06 <ipun>	but im not exactly sure the best way to do with without causing huge conflict
Oct 20 15:00:07 <lufimtse>	as discussed... 
Oct 20 15:05:03 <ipun>	lufimtse doesnt look like you can get mouse status, im going to try another way potientally
Oct 20 15:05:27 <lufimtse>	did gtk folks say?
Oct 20 15:07:10 <lufimtse>	Have a look:
Oct 20 15:07:10 <lufimtse>	https://developer.gnome.org/gdk3/stable/gdk3-Windows.html#gdk-window-get-device-position
Oct 20 15:07:17 <lufimtse>	 GdkModifierType *mask);
Oct 20 15:07:22 <lufimtse>	-->>> mask
Oct 20 15:07:33 <lufimtse>	GDK_BUTTON1_MASK
Oct 20 15:07:33 <lufimtse>		
Oct 20 15:07:33 <lufimtse>	the first mouse button.
Oct 20 15:07:46 <lufimtse>	in SWT, we use that call: org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.getCursorLocationInPixels()
Oct 20 15:08:15 <lufimtse>	Actually, this is better: org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.gdk_window_get_device_position(long, int[], int[], int[])
Oct 20 15:08:25 <lufimtse>	the last paramater is mask
Oct 20 15:08:33 <lufimtse>	No hard labour needed
Oct 20 15:08:49 <lufimtse>	just use that call, check if that mask contains the BUTTON1 mask.
Oct 20 15:08:54 <lufimtse>	job done.
Oct 20 15:09:00 <lufimtse>	Hopefully :-P
Oct 20 15:09:32 <lufimtse>	I was thinking of going to the cat rescue this weekend maybe.

Oct 31 10:20:47 <ipun>	i did it a while back, i just did it on the website

Oct 31 10:21:06 <ipun>	well the comment was changed 
Oct 31 10:21:20 <ipun>	all i did was change the wording of the comment, and then commented on your own comment
Oct 31 10:22:15 <ipun>	anyways, for your second comment, 2nd/3rd click mouse buttons dont need to be checked as those are not normal buttons used for drag and drop; not used in chrome or any other tab-type applcaitions from my experience
Oct 31 11:24:18 <ipun>	lufimtse let me know if the gerrit change is good so i can close it
Oct 31 14:42:37 <ipun>	tested on wayland, its all good

Nov 08 10:27:29 <ipun>	hey lufimtse, do you think its viable to close https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=501420
Nov 08 10:27:44 <ipun>	last comment basically is the issue, but its been solved (i believe)
Nov 08 10:27:51 <ipun>	doesnt look like anyone followed up with closing the bug
Nov 08 10:27:51 <lufimtse>	hey
Nov 08 10:30:55 <lufimtse>	It seems that the related bug 505923 was fixed. So maybe this bug is fixed also. You could post into the bug suggesting to close it and close it in a week if no one replies.
Nov 08 10:32:40 <ipun>	okay sounds good

Nov 08 14:39:08 <ipun>	lufimtse https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=503431
Nov 08 14:39:43 <ipun>	was fully tested from your comments on gerrit
Nov 08 14:39:47 <ipun>	responded on bugzilla
Nov 08 14:48:49 <lufimtse>	hullo
Nov 08 14:49:40 <lufimtse>	I think last time I asked if it's possible to get this done without use of context_iteration?
Nov 08 14:49:56 <lufimtse>	what happens if you remove that context iteration, but still check status of mouse in the loop?
Nov 08 14:50:11 <lufimtse>	does that work at all or is context iteration absolutley neccessary?
Nov 08 14:50:12 <ipun>	yeah i did that
Nov 08 14:50:18 <ipun>	i thought i told you already here on this channel
Nov 08 14:50:20 <ipun>	it doesnt work
Nov 08 14:50:23 <lufimtse>	I ese
Nov 08 14:50:28 <lufimtse>	I see
Nov 08 14:50:32 <ipun>	if you dont have a context iteration the event never moves on 
Nov 08 14:50:38 <ipun>	it times out pretty much
Nov 08 14:50:59 <lufimtse>	Lemme see patch

Nov 08 15:17:14 <lufimtse>	ipun, could you rebase?

Mar 21 14:04:35 <ipun>	pulled in a bigger audience than last time ( got around ~20 people) 
Mar 21 14:05:28 <ericwill>	nice
Mar 21 14:05:34 <ericwill>	did you meet Lars?
Mar 21 14:05:41 <ericwill>	and did you meet any of the IBM guys?
Mar 21 14:39:07 <lufimtse>	hey
Mar 21 14:39:08 <lufimtse>	sup
Mar 21 14:50:43 <ipun>	lufimtse:did you find the root of the dnd problem? 
Mar 21 14:50:51 <lufimtse>	yah
Mar 21 14:50:53 <lufimtse>	2 memory leack
Mar 21 14:50:54 <lufimtse>	s
Mar 21 14:50:59 <ipun>	ah okay
Mar 21 14:51:01 <ipun>	thanks for finding it!
Mar 21 14:51:05 <lufimtse>	fixed one, fix for other I'm about to push
Mar 21 14:51:15 <lufimtse>	I kinda didn't know Callback.java had to be disposed
Mar 21 14:51:23 <lufimtse>	so I kinda helped you introduce those memory leaks lol.
Mar 21 14:51:28 <ipun>	hopefully thats the most major problems we'll see with my dnd patch
Mar 21 14:51:35 *	ipun shrugs
Mar 21 14:51:54 <lufimtse>	There's still some kinda derp going on. After a while, view-parts dnd stops working.
Mar 21 14:51:55 <lufimtse>	derp
Mar 21 14:52:47 <ipun>	realy?
Mar 21 14:52:52 <ipun>	never had that issue on my end
Mar 21 14:53:04 <ipun>	must be some gesture callback problem
Mar 21 15:02:01 <ipun>	lufimtse ericwill : where can i check if my patches were in M6 or not?
Mar 21 15:02:25 <lufimtse>	If they're older than when M6 was released, they're part of M6.
Mar 21 15:02:36 <ericwill>	yeah if they were merged before the freeze date, it's in
Mar 21 15:04:47 <ipun>	where can i find the freeze date
Mar 21 15:06:08 <ericwill>	ipun https://wiki.eclipse.org/Oxygen/Simultaneous_Release_Plan#Schedule
Mar 21 15:06:17 <ipun>	thank you
Mar 21 15:07:34 <ipun>	ericwill: date says march 17, does that mean everything committed to master before the 17th is in m6?
Mar 21 15:08:31 <ericwill>	ipun I think so?
Mar 21 15:09:51 <ipun>	okay

Apr 06 12:15:17 <lufimtse>	Welcome Alex.
Apr 06 12:15:32 <akurtakov>	ipun: so are you going to revert everything ?
Apr 06 12:15:37 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hey :)
Apr 06 12:15:58 <ipun>	akurtakov: trust me, i have no choice
Apr 06 12:16:07 <lufimtse>	note:
Apr 06 12:16:08 <ipun>	but after the revert, i plan on adding the changes
Apr 06 12:16:11 <ipun>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94497/
Apr 06 12:16:26 <ipun>	this changeset basically includes the full revert + some development ive done that may solve this
Apr 06 12:16:57 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 12:17:09 <akurtakov>	I trust lufimtse for proper review
Apr 06 12:17:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the idea here is to keep DnD as part of MouseDown. It's not neccessarily what Gtk does, but it preserves Cocoa/Win32 compatability.
Apr 06 12:17:39 <lufimtse>	And thus custom widgets would not have to be changed.
Apr 06 12:18:27 <akurtakov>	this would not affect the gestures supprot, right?
Apr 06 12:18:36 <lufimtse>	you mean swiping?
Apr 06 12:18:37 <ipun>	akurtakov: no it wont
Apr 06 12:18:38 <akurtakov>	it shouldn't but I want to be sure
Apr 06 12:18:43 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 12:18:49 <ipun>	the way i implemented it wont affect this
Apr 06 12:19:52 <ipun>	there should be a dragGesture set on it nonetheless
Apr 06 12:20:12 <ipun>	but for consistency ill test it on my laptop
Apr 06 12:21:26 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 12:21:49 <akurtakov>	the patch is not ready for test yet, right?
Apr 06 12:22:00 <ipun>	its ready for testing for x11/wayland
Apr 06 12:24:08 <akurtakov>	http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2017/04/thank-you-note-to-hackernews.html
Apr 06 12:25:29 <ipun>	what a great day
Apr 06 12:27:01 <akurtakov>	https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/06/canonical_cuts_jobs_with_unity_bullet/
Apr 06 12:27:07 <akurtakov>	ubuntu seems to be sinking
Apr 06 12:30:08 <ipun>	akurtakov: confirmed that gestures is working
Apr 06 12:30:12 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 12:37:24 <ipun>	akurtakov: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94497/
Apr 06 12:37:27 <ipun>	thats the reverted changes
Apr 06 12:37:46 <ipun>	did you want me to do another commit that shows the additional patch on top of that revert?
Apr 06 12:37:55 <akurtakov>	ipun: exactly
Apr 06 12:38:05 <akurtakov>	so when I fetch the second one I get everything in shape 
Apr 06 12:38:49 <ipun>	akurtakov: did you want it in a different gerrit review or as a new patchset?
Apr 06 12:39:06 <akurtakov>	another review on top of the revert one
Apr 06 12:43:38 <ipun>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94597/
Apr 06 12:43:43 <ipun>	akurtakov ^
Apr 06 12:49:08 <akurtakov>	ipun: still when full line selection dnd is activated instead deselection
Apr 06 12:49:16 <akurtakov>	but not always tbh
Apr 06 12:50:04 <akurtakov>	for both x11 and wayland
Apr 06 12:50:31 <akurtakov>	if everything is reverted why break x11 ?
Apr 06 12:51:23 <akurtakov>	I insist on leaving x11 on being in the way it is currently
Apr 06 12:51:41 <ipun>	akurtakov: because lufimtse said to do it for x11 too :)
Apr 06 12:51:46 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: NO
Apr 06 12:51:49 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 06 12:52:00 <ipun>	akurtakov: i insisted no
Apr 06 12:52:04 *	ipun shrugs
Apr 06 12:52:20 <akurtakov>	any chance of potential breakage now should be reduced
Apr 06 12:52:45 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: please take this seriously, we can not afford more X11 regressions
Apr 06 12:53:15 <akurtakov>	no matter you like it or not - it stays how it is until wayland proven tobe stable
Apr 06 12:54:18 <akurtakov>	once wayland is stable we can speak of unifying 
Apr 06 12:54:26 <akurtakov>	we are almost at M7 and everything is broken
Apr 06 12:54:27 <lufimtse>	May I suggest to leave things as is until Oxygen is released and then work on things?
Apr 06 12:54:44 <akurtakov>	for x11 yes 
Apr 06 12:54:53 <akurtakov>	for wayland - it has to work in Oxygen
Apr 06 12:55:12 <ipun>	lufimtse: we can still include the fix i did and guard it with isX11
Apr 06 12:56:14 <akurtakov>	ipun: +1
Apr 06 12:56:34 <ipun>	lufimtse: ill even comment it with // Wayland for you :)
Apr 06 12:56:37 <akurtakov>	further more on x11 the new patch doesn't switch ctabs with first click but with secon
Apr 06 12:56:40 <lufimtse>	In the sense I wasn't planning on the new DnD changes to take place until after Oxygen.
Apr 06 12:56:52 <lufimtse>	./forgot to mention. 
Apr 06 12:57:08 <lufimtse>	We're ok with having a bunch of !x11 guards
Apr 06 12:57:13 <lufimtse>	so long as current code stays same.
Apr 06 12:58:02 <akurtakov>	btw with the new code
Apr 06 12:58:33 <akurtakov>	I end up with the old funny bug of moving around ctabs instead of switching them on wayland
Apr 06 12:58:50 <ipun>	akurtakov: yeah i just noticed that
Apr 06 12:58:57 <ipun>	sigh 
Apr 06 12:59:08 <ipun>	this really sucks 
Apr 06 12:59:13 <akurtakov>	that's worse than current master which has only StyledText broken on wayland
Apr 06 12:59:17 <lufimtse>	It might be because MouseRelease is fired before MouseDown is finished.
Apr 06 12:59:47 <lufimtse>	Not sure thou. 
Apr 06 13:03:36 <akurtakov>	so guys, let's make things clear on one thing - x11 stays as it is and everything regarding wayland is guarded with if !x11
Apr 06 13:03:53 <akurtakov>	for at least 2 milestones once we put it int
Apr 06 13:03:58 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, We initially started moving DnD logic into MouseMovement, because that's the 'gtk' method of doing it and is more sound. However, after time we discovered that this approach causes breakage in Custom widgets.    -> As such we are now seeking to get DnD logic to work in MouseDown for wayland.
Apr 06 13:04:09 <akurtakov>	until even thinking of unifying it
Apr 06 13:04:29 <lufimtse>	I have no objections against if !x11 guard for now.
Apr 06 13:05:17 <akurtakov>	so are we saying we go with MouseMove for wayland and MouseDown for x11 for Oxygen?
Apr 06 13:05:32 <lufimtse>	No,
Apr 06 13:05:36 <lufimtse>	hmm
Apr 06 13:05:41 <lufimtse>	sec.
Apr 06 13:05:52 <akurtakov>	this is what we have in master, right?
Apr 06 13:06:03 <akurtakov>	fwiw, it's the best thing I have seen so far
Apr 06 13:06:28 <lufimtse>	X11 will be same as is now in oxygen, no changes
Apr 06 13:06:32 <lufimtse>	for Wayland .... 
Apr 06 13:06:41 <lufimtse>	1) We will work on mouseDown solution
Apr 06 13:06:46 <lufimtse>	2) In mean time leave mouseMove
Apr 06 13:07:02 <lufimtse>	if mouseDown solution is good to go, use that in Oxygen. If not, leave mouse move.
Apr 06 13:07:08 <lufimtse>	does that make sense?
Apr 06 13:07:33 <akurtakov>	ok, when do we put the deadline for that decision?
Apr 06 13:08:15 <lufimtse>	I think deadline is dependent on if MouseMove method will be up and running in time. I propose to keep things in patches and out of master for now.
Apr 06 13:08:49 <lufimtse>	At least until Oxygen release.
Apr 06 13:09:14 <lufimtse>	This should ensure consistent behaviour until we are ready for switch. 
Apr 06 13:09:28 <lufimtse>	For the switch, we will be doing extensive testing to make sure all reported regressions do not occur.
Apr 06 13:10:44 <lufimtse>	Thoughts?
Apr 06 13:12:58 <akurtakov>	well, I still want wayland + oxygen in better shape
Apr 06 13:13:35 <lufimtse>	Can you define "better", do you mean functioning styledText?
Apr 06 13:14:13 <akurtakov>	yes if possible
Apr 06 13:14:23 <akurtakov>	or at least what we can get 
Apr 06 13:14:29 <lufimtse>	This would require us to get MouseDown solution working.
Apr 06 13:14:30 <akurtakov>	even if it's baby steps 
Apr 06 13:14:35 <lufimtse>	on wayland
Apr 06 13:14:39 <akurtakov>	or improve on the MouseMove
Apr 06 13:14:51 <lufimtse>	MouseMove has architectural problem,
Apr 06 13:15:09 <akurtakov>	for which I want a deadline - how much time do we give MouseDown to see it's working
Apr 06 13:15:16 <lufimtse>	I see.
Apr 06 13:15:19 <lufimtse>	Hmmm.
Apr 06 13:15:27 <lufimtse>	Let me think.
Apr 06 13:15:32 <akurtakov>	it may have arch problem but it is smth that we will release in June
Apr 06 13:15:47 <akurtakov>	and will live with us for the next 14-16 months
Apr 06 13:15:58 <lufimtse>	Is "IS_GTK" accetable in styled text?
Apr 06 13:16:11 <lufimtse>	and CTabFolder?
Apr 06 13:16:33 <akurtakov>	no, because IS_GTK solution would do changes for x11 too - which is unwanted
Apr 06 13:16:46 <akurtakov>	and this is jsut the tip of the iceberg
Apr 06 13:16:47 <lufimtse>	Then we have a problem with MouseMove approach.
Apr 06 13:17:05 <lufimtse>	MouseMove + Stayled text requires IS_GTK. 
Apr 06 13:17:22 <lufimtse>	As such, we have to push for MouseDown.
Apr 06 13:17:31 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 06 13:17:42 <lufimtse>	Please give me a few minutes to think.
Apr 06 13:18:01 <akurtakov>	or it requires if (!x11 && control instanceof StyledText) kind of hacks in Drag*
Apr 06 13:19:16 <akurtakov>	ipun: do you think you can enhance StyledText after trippleclick on wayland with current master
Apr 06 13:19:43 <lufimtse>	Interesting...
Apr 06 13:20:09 <akurtakov>	and we continue fighting wayland that way as we find issues
Apr 06 13:20:29 <lufimtse>	BTW, can we modify things until RC3 Friday, June 09?
Apr 06 13:21:55 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: with each next step you need one more additional +1
Apr 06 13:21:58 <akurtakov>	first one more committer
Apr 06 13:22:08 <akurtakov>	next +project lead
Apr 06 13:22:14 <akurtakov>	next + PMC approval
Apr 06 13:24:50 <akurtakov>	see here from last year
Apr 06 13:25:45 <akurtakov>	https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/freeze_plan_4_6.php#FixPassAfterRC0 specifically
Apr 06 13:27:16 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: this year will be pretty much the same
Apr 06 13:29:49 <lufimtse>	I see.
Apr 06 13:30:23 <lufimtse>	So basically we have until May 4th to make changes freely, after that it's difficult?
Apr 06 13:30:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, is that correct?
Apr 06 13:30:49 <akurtakov>	yes
Apr 06 13:31:05 <lufimtse>	In that case, I have the following suggestion:
Apr 06 13:31:19 <lufimtse>	- We stick to current MouseMove and try to hack things via instanceOf
Apr 06 13:31:29 <lufimtse>	- THEN, work on MouseDown architecture
Apr 06 13:31:33 <akurtakov>	works for me
Apr 06 13:32:00 <akurtakov>	THEN might be delayed  though
Apr 06 13:32:10 <lufimtse>	I see.
Apr 06 13:32:26 <akurtakov>	as we need also Webkit2 finished early in Photon too
Apr 06 13:32:43 <lufimtse>	feasible.
Apr 06 13:33:36 <lufimtse>	So my understanding ME:  DnD polish && Webkit2 polish -> Oxygen release -> Webkit2 Browser function && DnD MouseDown architecture
Apr 06 13:33:40 <lufimtse>	that correct?
Apr 06 13:33:52 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Apr 06 13:34:24 <akurtakov>	after Oxygen release -> + ton of other things :)
Apr 06 13:34:29 <lufimtse>	X-D
Apr 06 13:34:30 <lufimtse>	ok.
Apr 06 13:34:35 <lufimtse>	Fair game.
Apr 06 13:34:49 <lufimtse>	I'm off to lunch.
Apr 06 13:34:56 <lufimtse>	I'll chat with Ian in a bit.
Apr 06 13:36:04 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 06 14:29:39 <ipun>	akurtakov: I'm going to dive deeper into what i've done with motion drags and see ifi can get this working with styledtext using instanceOf
Apr 06 14:29:53 <akurtakov>	ipun: good
Apr 06 14:30:05 <ipun>	i much prefer the mouse movement stuff anyways
Apr 06 14:30:25 <lufimtse>	ipun, sendDragEvent (gdkEvent.button, gdkEvent.state, (int) gdkEvent.x, (int) gdkEvent.y, false); << delay execution of that guy.
Apr 06 14:30:29 <lufimtse>	basically.
Apr 06 14:30:49 <ipun>	lufimtse: i figured you were talking about that
Apr 06 14:30:53 <ipun>	ill work something around it now
Apr 06 14:30:55 <akurtakov>	only thing I prefer is the working one :)
Apr 06 14:31:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, he he :-)
Apr 06 15:01:06 <ipun>	can you allow  (IS_GTK) additions to styledText?
Apr 06 15:01:10 <ipun>	if it all works that is
Apr 06 15:01:20 <ipun>	akurtakov: 
Apr 06 15:02:29 <akurtakov>	ipun: wouldn't that change x11 behavior too ?
Apr 06 15:02:50 <ipun>	akurtakov: if i could figure out a solution to not change x11 behavior, could i do it?
Apr 06 15:03:36 <akurtakov>	in general I don't like the idea but if there is no other way and you can make it to not change x11 we can speak about it
Apr 06 15:03:46 <akurtakov>	but note that I'll question it heavily
Apr 06 15:03:59 <ipun>	okay sounds good

Apr 12 12:11:30 <ipun>	akurtakov: regarding the GtkText fix, I don't seem to be running into the crash on X11
Apr 12 12:11:39 <ipun>	are you doing a Text -> label transfer on DnDExample?
Apr 12 12:16:40 <akurtakov>	ipun: yes
Apr 12 12:16:58 <akurtakov>	ipun: I make it crash one out of 3 tries
Apr 12 12:17:53 <ipun>	wierd... I cant seem to do it
Apr 12 12:18:11 <ipun>	let me check out my logic again and maybe it screwed up the x11 passages
Apr 12 12:18:22 <akurtakov>	do you use this patch on top of your queue patch or on top of master ?
Apr 12 12:29:32 <ipun>	akurtakov: the patch was only off of master
Apr 12 12:29:50 <ipun>	are you doing it off of my queue patch as well?
Apr 12 12:33:41 <akurtakov>	yes
Apr 12 12:40:09 <ipun>	hmm okay ill play around with that as well then
Apr 12 12:49:55 <ipun>	i havent been able to replicate the crash but I do notice it being slower. Ill see what i can do
Apr 12 12:50:41 <ipun>	also seems to be completely broken in Wayland on text
Apr 12 13:00:05 <ipun>	could you try with the latest patch when you have time?
Apr 13 09:36:09 <ipun>	akurtakov: did you get a chance to see if https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94861 works?
Apr 13 09:36:18 <akurtakov>	doing it now
Apr 13 09:36:22 <ipun>	kk thanks
Apr 13 09:38:53 <akurtakov>	ipun: sorry , happens again
Apr 13 09:39:08 <akurtakov>	ipun: double click to select a word
Apr 13 09:39:11 <akurtakov>	dnd - works
Apr 13 09:39:23 <akurtakov>	repeat with another word - crash
Apr 13 09:39:34 <ipun>	ah i can reproduce it now
Apr 13 09:39:35 <ipun>	thank you
Apr 13 09:40:04 <akurtakov>	ipun: np, sorry if I wasn't clear the first time :)
Apr 13 09:40:44 <ipun>	akurtakov: its okay. With that I should be able to get to the bottom of this. My fix inherinently shouldnt cause any harm to x11 but it is, so this is important
Apr 13 09:42:04 <ipun>	okay the problem actually started with 510446, not 515035
Apr 13 09:42:32 <akurtakov>	?
Apr 13 09:46:10 <akurtakov>	I have to run now, happy easter :)
Apr 13 09:46:12 <ipun>	akurtakov: actually i lied
Apr 13 09:46:16 <ipun>	its not working on master
Apr 13 09:46:29 <ipun>	anyways ill figure it out :)

Apr 19 10:27:27 <akurtakov>	let him move to the launchbar
Apr 19 10:27:32 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 19 10:27:35 <lufimtse>	bt
Apr 19 10:27:36 <lufimtse>	btw
Apr 19 10:27:43 <lufimtse>	can I get you to test a patch briefly
Apr 19 10:27:50 <akurtakov>	sure
Apr 19 10:28:07 <lufimtse>	Can you checkout and see if DnD works on your machine with this guy:
Apr 19 10:28:07 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95207/
Apr 19 10:28:13 <lufimtse>	It's based on SWT code that's 1 year old
Apr 19 10:28:18 <lufimtse>	so eclipse is buggy on it
Apr 19 10:28:29 <lufimtse>	but i just want to know if dnd works on your machine 
Apr 19 10:28:32 <lufimtse>	with that guy
Apr 19 10:28:36 <lufimtse>	tests:
Apr 19 10:28:44 <lufimtse>	1) StyledText, select text, drag
Apr 19 10:28:49 <lufimtse>	2) Package explorer
Apr 19 10:28:52 <lufimtse>	3) Staging area
Apr 19 10:28:56 <lufimtse>	3) DnD example
Apr 19 10:29:30 <lufimtse>	There's a quirck with StyledText DnD backwards selection & moving forward, but that's to be investigated later. For now Just want to know if basic dnd works.
Apr 19 10:30:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, let me know once done
Apr 19 10:47:10 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: DnD example seems to be fine
Apr 19 10:47:19 <akurtakov>	but eclipse is not starting for me
Apr 19 10:47:27 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, fair enough.
Apr 19 10:47:29 <lufimtse>	thank you.
Apr 19 10:47:44 <akurtakov>	it is just stuck on startup
Apr 19 11:57:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, yea, it's swt from a year ago. Maybe something's flaky.

Apr 19 12:58:21 <akurtakov>	guys I'll not find time to test the dnd this week
Apr 19 12:58:36 <akurtakov>	so please test/push yourself
Apr 19 13:00:08 <lufimtse>	ipun, akurtakov I encourage you guys to use the rebuild_swt_natives.sh script. Automates bunch of mundate tasks.
Apr 19 13:00:11 <lufimtse>	cd ~/bin/
Apr 19 13:00:16 <lufimtse>	ln -s ~/git/eclipse.platform.swt/bundles/org.eclipse.swt.tools/gtk/rebuild_swt_natives.sh swtb
Apr 19 13:00:24 <lufimtse>	ex ^ sim-link to it.
Apr 19 13:00:33 <lufimtse>	but note, I pushed a change just now so that it works when symlinked.
Apr 19 13:00:55 <lufimtse>	with above you can use via 'swtb'
Apr 19 13:01:19 <akurtakov>	will this create git noise ?
Apr 19 13:01:29 <akurtakov>	ah it's in bin sorry :)
Apr 19 13:01:49 <lufimtse>	this is for personal machine
Apr 19 13:02:21 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: well, there is mail from Martin asking for building swt natives on the mailing list
Apr 19 13:02:29 <akurtakov>	and getting confused with the wiki
Apr 19 13:02:32 <lufimtse>	let me check
Apr 19 13:06:14 <akurtakov>	looks like some cleanup in the content is needed
Apr 19 13:06:28 <akurtakov>	simpler howto maybe with less conditions :)
Apr 19 13:06:52 <akurtakov>	doh of the webpage I mean
Apr 19 13:07:59 <akurtakov>	sigh, we should really automate this inside eclipse
Apr 19 15:44:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ipun the DnD patch for manually managing outging SWT.Mouse* events is in. I.e, DnD in external widgets like styledText and CTabFolder should be functional.
Apr 19 15:45:04 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: cool, can't wait for tomorrow's build :)
Apr 19 15:52:18 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, btw do you know: If you have a 'dltk' buildCommand in the .project (I.e, shelled support), but you don't have shelled installed, are there any problems?
Apr 19 15:52:24 <lufimtse>	or is it silently installed?
Apr 19 15:52:46 <akurtakov>	it is silently ignored
Apr 19 15:52:48 <lufimtse>	yay
Apr 19 15:53:06 <akurtakov>	well, not build command but nature :)
Apr 19 15:54:20 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: there is wip to make marketplace client proposing to install though 
Apr 19 15:54:22 <akurtakov>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=513306
Apr 19 15:54:28 <akurtakov>	hopefully for oxygen
Apr 19 15:56:48 <lufimtse>	interesting
Apr 19 15:56:56 <lufimtse>	is it working atm? only with the ini setting?
Apr 19 15:57:06 <lufimtse>	lemme ping Mickael
Apr 19 15:58:08 *	akurtakov feels like walking organizer for the release train :)
Apr 19 16:00:38 <ipun>	akurtakov: where did you get any of the information about XSetInputFocus and such from SHell.java | line 573 and below?
Apr 19 16:00:55 <akurtakov>	ipun: let me open swt :)
Apr 19 16:01:17 *	akurtakov jumps from p2 to swt :)
Apr 19 16:02:01 <akurtakov>	ipun: the comment iis in the wrong place
Apr 19 16:02:13 <akurtakov>	it should be in the if X11 block
Apr 19 16:02:36 <akurtakov>	XSetInputFocus is xlib function so makes no sense outside of it
Apr 19 16:03:54 <ipun>	it is inside the x11 block im just curious how you got this information on how to handle override redirects
Apr 19 16:04:36 <akurtakov>	ipun: no idea 
Apr 19 16:04:53 <akurtakov>	this is from the very first kept commit in the repo :)
Apr 19 16:08:28 <ipun>	DANG
Apr 19 16:09:02 <akurtakov>	ipun: so gtk_window_present that is commented does nothing ?
Apr 19 16:09:10 <ipun>	does nothing
Apr 19 16:09:55 <akurtakov>	same for .gdk_window_focus (window, OS.GDK_CURRENT_TIME); ?
Apr 19 16:12:48 <ipun>	it was giving us that "gtk window_present_with_time" failure, and we tried using the proper time with it and it still failed
Apr 19 16:17:27 <akurtakov>	no idea :)
Apr 19 16:22:12 <ipun>	thanks anyways akurtakov :)

Apr 21 14:57:34 <akurtakov>	and most important quite safe change
Apr 21 14:57:50 <ipun>	yeah tried to keep it that way :)
Apr 21 15:00:05 <ipun>	k its rebased
Apr 21 15:11:37 <akurtakov>	ipun: can you type in the text fielter ?
Apr 21 15:13:02 <akurtakov>	ipun: you need many(6-8+) launch configs for it to show at the top
Apr 21 15:13:35 <akurtakov>	ipun: another issue if you alt-tap to another app the popup stays on tp
Apr 21 15:13:38 <akurtakov>	on top
Apr 21 15:15:10 <akurtakov>	ipun: it's really weird - I can select text in the filter with mouse but can't type in it
Apr 21 15:15:48 <ipun>	hmm okay
Apr 21 15:16:33 <ipun>	i can type in mine
Apr 21 15:17:34 <ipun>	also i it looks like it doesnt automatically focus on the textbox when you click it. But if you click the textbox you are able to start typing
Apr 21 15:19:18 <ipun>	akurtakov: did you mean that the filterbox shows up only after 6-8+ lunach configs are displayed? or do you mean anything under that it is not at the top?
Apr 21 15:23:02 <ipun>	if you look at CSelector.java | line 318 that is where you dont see the filter box until at least 8
Apr 21 15:25:50 <akurtakov>	weird, I can't type in mine
Apr 21 15:25:56 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: can you?

Apr 21 15:29:06 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ok

Apr 21 15:33:02 <akurtakov>	ok

Apr 21 15:34:53 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, where is the launchbar?
Apr 21 15:35:02 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, is it part of a cdt plugin, do you know which one?
Apr 21 15:35:10 <lufimtse>	it doesn't seem to be a separate plugin
Apr 21 15:35:30 <lufimtse>	ipun, can you spy on the thing to find out which plugin it's from?
Apr 21 15:35:40 <lufimtse>	ipun, or look into your installed plugin business

Apr 21 15:52:42 <lufimtse>	ipun, testing...
Apr 21 15:55:16 <lufimtse>	ipun, when I start a child Eclipse, the launchbar is no where to be found. Do you know how to make it appaer? (I tried all the target platform plugins enabled)

Apr 24 10:28:56 <ipun>	basically the GTK_POPUP type of shell doesnt let you grab keyboard focus right away from my testing, so you'll notice that the filter box actually isnt focused when you click it in Wayland

Apr 24 12:37:50 <ipun>	okay in that case ill get lufimtse to just run the snippet instead of messing around with launchbar 
Apr 24 12:38:27 <ipun>	akurtakov: when you click the textbox, is it selected at all? (blue highlight around the edges of the box)
Apr 24 12:41:30 <akurtakov>	ipun: no
Apr 24 12:41:41 <akurtakov>	ipun: it's visible on the video I sent you too
Apr 24 12:43:28 <ipun>	hmmm...the fix was within Shell.java | line 712 setting the type hint. Im trying to figure out why that works in the first place on mine
Apr 24 12:43:34 <lufimtse>	ipun, ok, let me test the snippet on wayland

Apr 24 12:44:10 *	Now talking on #SWT
Apr 24 12:51:34 <ipun>	akurtakov: its  very annoying as im trying to run gtk inspector on the popup window to debug and its just SWT FIXED
Apr 24 12:51:39 <ipun>	doesnt show any infomration about type
Apr 24 12:58:52 <akurtakov>	ipun: SwtFixed should have children
Apr 24 13:00:31 <akurtakov>	so it doesn't work fro lufimtse too
Apr 24 13:00:54 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, yea,
Apr 24 13:01:06 <lufimtse>	<ian is in kitchen snacking> :-)
Apr 24 13:01:53 <ipun>	damn
Apr 24 13:01:55 <ipun>	okay
Apr 24 13:02:00 <ipun>	thats good i guess
Apr 24 13:02:03 <ipun>	now time ti figure out why mine works
Apr 24 13:04:14 <akurtakov>	ipun: fighting stress with icecream ? :)
Apr 24 13:04:32 <ipun>	akurtakov: if only there was icecream...
Apr 24 13:04:43 <ipun>	also, it doesnt look like i can claim my beer from you this year
Apr 24 13:04:45 <ipun>	:(
Apr 24 13:05:05 <akurtakov>	ipun: haha :)
Apr 24 13:05:20 <akurtakov>	I remember it but not what it was for :)
Apr 24 13:05:43 <ipun>	"SWT"
Apr 24 13:05:46 <ipun>	just kidding ;)
Apr 24 13:09:52 <ipun>	gonna do an update for fedora and see if i can reproduce
Apr 24 13:10:36 <akurtakov>	so you're not running latest f25 ?

Apr 24 13:18:40 *	Now talking on #SWT
Apr 24 13:31:41 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: just saw your promise to test on the mpc bug
Apr 24 13:31:48 <akurtakov>	fwiw, I use smth like http://www.babblingengineer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gtd_chart.png
Apr 24 13:31:58 <akurtakov>	where I have changed 2 mins with 15 mins
Apr 24 13:32:20 <akurtakov>	works pretty well for me to finish many things and don't let the queue grow
Apr 24 14:13:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I do something simmilar
Apr 24 14:13:30 <lufimtse>	this week is an exception
Apr 24 14:13:36 <lufimtse>	^_^
Apr 24 14:19:10 <akurtakov>	yeah, I understand that
Apr 24 14:19:19 <akurtakov>	I'm just giving you a hint :)
Apr 24 14:21:41 <ipun>	akurtakov: i have still no idea why this works on my computer and not anyone elses...
Apr 24 14:22:09 <ipun>	akurtakov, lufimtse what gtk versions are you running?
Apr 24 14:22:24 <lufimtse>	3.22
Apr 24 14:22:32 <lufimtse>	3.22.11
Apr 24 14:23:13 <ipun>	i wonder if its because im using 3.22.12
Apr 24 14:27:33 <ipun>	care to update lufimtse ?
Apr 24 14:28:07 <lufimtse>	ipun, I could
Apr 24 14:28:36 <lufimtse>	gtk is not marked for upgrade on my system
Apr 24 14:28:37 <lufimtse>	meh
Apr 24 14:28:40 <lufimtse>	sudo dnf update
Apr 24 14:28:44 <lufimtse>	ipun, 
Apr 24 14:28:58 <ipun>	oh.
Apr 24 14:28:58 <lufimtse>	ipun, can you test with an older gtk?
Apr 24 14:28:59 <lufimtse>	3.20
Apr 24 14:29:02 <lufimtse>	see if it reproduces
Apr 24 14:29:03 <lufimtse>	etc
Apr 24 14:30:15 <ipun>	kk ill gvie it a go
Apr 24 14:31:36 <ipun>	sigh my 3.2 doesnt run wayland
Apr 24 14:32:40 <ipun>	tried it on gtk3.189 and it works
Apr 24 14:33:11 <ipun>	lufimtse: care to come swing by in a bit to see if i forgotsomething?
Apr 24 14:33:34 <lufimtse>	hey
Apr 24 15:29:15 <ipun>	hey akurtakov did you say that doing any api additions require a lot more work now?
Apr 24 15:29:28 <akurtakov>	yes
Apr 24 15:29:34 <ipun>	to fix something up in GTKText fix i was thinking about adding a getDragGesture() call
Apr 24 15:29:51 <akurtakov>	that would not be new API ?
Apr 24 15:30:05 <ipun>	no it would just be a method within control
Apr 24 15:30:20 <akurtakov>	as long as it's default/private it should be fine
Apr 24 15:30:24 <ipun>	cause we have a setDragGesture(), but no getDragGesture()
Apr 24 15:30:30 <ipun>	hmm okay let me see if it works oaky
Apr 24 15:33:21 <ipun>	akurtakov: it looks like it would have to be public for the sake that other methods should be able to get the Gesture widgets if needed
Apr 24 15:33:30 *	ipun feels like that might take a bit more convincing
Apr 24 15:35:01 <akurtakov>	setDragGesture is private
Apr 24 15:35:14 <akurtakov>	why would you need to set it ?
Apr 24 15:36:43 <akurtakov>	ipun: ^
Apr 24 15:37:30 <ipun>	akurtakov: the addition would be a public method getDragGesture(), i wouldnt be changing setDragGesture() at all
Apr 24 15:37:37 <ipun>	that should remain private
Apr 24 15:37:44 <akurtakov>	why?
Apr 24 15:37:53 <akurtakov>	and what would you return ?
Apr 24 15:38:04 <ipun>	it would just return the controls DragSource widget
Apr 24 15:38:10 <ipun>	DragGesture*
Apr 24 15:38:30 <akurtakov>	ipun: and how would that look on win32/cocoa?
Apr 24 15:39:05 <ipun>	akurtakov: ...hmm i see what you mean
Apr 24 15:39:15 <ipun>	okay no worries, i will figure out another way
Apr 24 15:39:32 <ipun>	it wouldnt work publically for win32/cocoa for sure i didnt think of that my bad
Apr 24 15:39:32 <akurtakov>	to make it clear in order to add new api it has to be implemented on 2 out of 3 (gtk,cocoa, win32)
Apr 24 15:40:10 <akurtakov>	and adding such api at this time and out of the blue  (even if implemented on 2 WS) has zero chances 
Apr 24 15:40:18 <akurtakov>	ipun: try to explain to me why you need it
Apr 24 15:48:13 <ipun>	in regards to GTKText, it currently fixes the issue but when DragBegin signal is caught from GTK, i make it send a DragStart SWT signal back with no x/y coordinates. Having the DragGesture widget will let me grab the correct x/y coordinates to send to SWT 
Apr 24 15:54:34 <akurtakov>	think of IoC 
Apr 24 15:54:42 <akurtakov>	instanceof? maybe
Apr 24 15:56:53 <ipun>	if i use instance of i could grab private values?
Apr 24 15:59:33 <ipun>	akurtakov: would making the dragGestures public instead of having a public method be any different?
Apr 24 16:43:59 <ipun>	lufimtse: it doesnt look likei can get the x/y coordinates the easy way
Apr 24 16:44:34 <lufimtse>	ipun, hmmm
Apr 24 16:44:38 <ipun>	its okay though
Apr 24 16:44:43 <ipun>	ill see if i can figure out another way
Apr 24 16:44:45 <ipun>	may not be the most accurate
Apr 24 16:47:44 <ipun>	got it, pushed now
Apr 24 17:24:03 <ipun>	lufimtse: take a look at the chagnes i did when you have time
Apr 24 17:24:10 <ipun>	should be possible
Apr 24 17:24:12 <ipun>	pushable*
Apr 25 09:22:54 <ipun>	akurtakov: i got a better fix that doesnt need any change to api
Apr 25 09:23:02 <ipun>	just waiting for lufimtse to check it out
Apr 25 09:23:17 <ipun>	i'll just be using internal Display cursor location call instead
Apr 25 09:23:43 <akurtakov>	ipun: sounds good :)
Apr 25 11:20:57 <ipun>	lufimtse: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95705/ 
Apr 25 11:21:01 <ipun>	mind if you do a quick check on this one?
Apr 25 11:21:04 <ipun>	just a one liner
Apr 25 11:21:07 <lufimtse>	ipun, Lemme see
Apr 25 11:22:41 <akurtakov>	ipun: definetely not OK
Apr 25 11:22:59 <akurtakov>	this would make various plugins fail with SWTError
Apr 25 11:23:14 <ipun>	akurtakov: where do you propose we put the SWT error?
Apr 25 11:23:24 <akurtakov>	there shouldn't be an error
Apr 25 11:23:54 <akurtakov>	it should do the next best thing to cover this case or nothing
Apr 25 11:23:56 <akurtakov>	but no error
Apr 25 11:24:07 <ipun>	okay sounds good
Apr 25 12:14:59 <ipun>	akurtakov, lufimtse: new patchset will just include a error but wont cause it to crash. Leo, you can use new SWTError().printStackTrace() to do that instead of system.err
Apr 25 12:16:02 <lufimtse>	ipun, thanks for sharing
Apr 25 12:16:40 <ipun>	lufimtse: no problem
Apr 25 12:17:20 <ipun>	akurtakov: the only work done by GTK team to support gtkSockets is this: https://github.com/alexlarsson/wakefield but this hasnt been worked on for 2 years...
Apr 25 12:17:43 <ipun>	the patch i included will just warn and wont block, so i guess it techincally do "nothing"
Apr 26 09:40:13 <ipun>	akurtakov: could you take a screenshot of the page you're referring to in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95734/ please?
Apr 26 09:41:24 <akurtakov>	ipun: https://imagebin.ca/v/3KPD9JscLDyX
Apr 26 09:50:18 <ipun>	akurtakov: how did you get to that dialog? I normally just click Run configurations and edit from there and it doesnt give me that problem
Apr 26 09:50:47 <akurtakov>	ipun: gear button in launch configuration 
Apr 26 09:50:56 <akurtakov>	launchbar I mean
Apr 26 09:51:19 <ipun>	ohh right
Apr 26 09:53:02 <ipun>	kk ill look into this
Apr 26 09:53:30 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95705/ this is not OK
Apr 26 09:54:07 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hey
Apr 26 09:54:10 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 26 09:54:22 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, it only prints stack trace afaik
Apr 26 09:54:43 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what is the issue?
Apr 26 09:55:16 <akurtakov>	the code should be modified so EMBEDDED is a no_op on wayland
Apr 26 09:55:37 <lufimtse>	no_op?
Apr 26 09:55:46 <lufimtse>	I guess I should've added you as reviewer on that one
Apr 26 09:56:09 <lufimtse>	what is no_op?
Apr 26 09:56:15 <akurtakov>	no operation
Apr 26 09:56:31 <akurtakov>	aka do nothing if not x11 and style embedded
Apr 26 09:57:45 <akurtakov>	http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/no-op-no-operation
Apr 26 09:59:13 <lufimtse>	You mean skip and not print anything?
Apr 26 09:59:32 <lufimtse>	You mean no error, just silently skip?
Apr 26 09:59:57 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Apr 26 10:00:08 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: yes
Apr 26 10:00:22 <akurtakov>	with comment in the code
Apr 26 10:00:28 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, well, what about users who are trying to embed elements with SWT on wayland and have no idea why it doesn't work.
Apr 26 10:00:41 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, shouldn't we suggest something to them?
Apr 26 10:01:02 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what's the logic behind silent skipping, why?
Apr 26 10:01:18 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, afterall, gtk throws warnings if we do something wrong as well.
Apr 26 10:01:38 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: this is how swt behaves
Apr 26 10:02:03 <akurtakov>	there was no gesture support and swt was silently skipping someone using the gesture api
Apr 26 10:02:16 <akurtakov>	provide as much as possible without bail out
Apr 26 10:02:38 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, But we have things like "no more callbacks" error warning, which has proven to be very useful.
Apr 26 10:02:48 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what's the issue with having a warnings?
Apr 26 10:03:14 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, silent skip makes it hard to figure out why things don't work.
Apr 26 10:03:20 <akurtakov>	issue is you will step everything else from working in this case for no reason as we know it's not working
Apr 26 10:03:37 <akurtakov>	while in the no more callback case its unrecoverable
Apr 26 10:04:09 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, no, a warning doesn't stop everything else from working.
Apr 26 10:04:15 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, it's just a warning.
Apr 26 10:04:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the patch doesn't terminate operation
Apr 26 10:04:38 <lufimtse>	afaik
Apr 26 10:05:02 <akurtakov>	ah, it's not throwing it
Apr 26 10:05:05 <akurtakov>	so it really does nothing
Apr 26 10:05:42 <lufimtse>	yep
Apr 26 10:05:46 <lufimtse>	just prints stacktrace
Apr 26 10:05:51 <lufimtse>	and continues
Apr 26 10:06:11 <akurtakov>	it should be wrapped up in if DEBUG in this case
Apr 26 10:06:22 <lufimtse>	we have a debug flag?
Apr 26 10:07:23 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: Device.DEBUG
Apr 26 10:07:49 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, interesting, let me check
Apr 26 10:09:00 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: if you download http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/I20170425-2000/download.php?dropFile=swt-I20170425-2000-gtk-linux-x86_64.zip
Apr 26 10:09:11 <akurtakov>	you would even see two swt jars
Apr 26 10:09:18 <akurtakov>	one with debug on and one off
Apr 26 10:10:22 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, interesting
Apr 26 10:11:44 <akurtakov>	this is not the only thing
Apr 26 10:12:17 <akurtakov>	actually it would be nice if Device.DEBUG is bound to env variable
Apr 26 10:12:47 <akurtakov>	and set to true if variable set but I never got to it
Apr 26 10:12:51 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 26 10:15:09 <akurtakov>	Device.init() should set it to env variable if set
Apr 26 10:15:22 <akurtakov>	as this is not user visible it has always been very low prio to me
Apr 26 10:19:17 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: in short : a lot of room for improvement again :)
Apr 26 10:20:11 <akurtakov>	and sorry for missing the fact you're not actually throwing the exception
Apr 26 10:20:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah
Apr 26 10:20:46 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, thanks for pointing out DEBUG flag.
Apr 26 10:20:54 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, let me investigate and see if we can update Ian's patch
Apr 26 10:21:09 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I find discussions very constructive :-)
Apr 26 10:21:12 <akurtakov>	just do a follow up commit wrapping it
Apr 26 10:22:05 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok. Btw, do you know how the DEBUG flag is set by the swt.debug.jar in compiliation?
Apr 26 10:22:34 <akurtakov>	don't remember or maybe I mix it up with debug info?
Apr 26 10:22:40 <akurtakov>	meh, such a mess
Apr 26 10:23:05 <akurtakov>	for the build I mean
Apr 26 10:23:14 <akurtakov>	Inever liked the idea of 2 jars tbh
Apr 26 10:23:29 <lufimtse>	I found this guy https://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#debugmode
Apr 26 10:29:53 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: btw, I just found http://git.net/ml/commits.gnome/2016-10/msg01931.html
Apr 26 10:30:26 <akurtakov>	ipun: looks like it's not in progress anymore ?
Apr 26 10:31:34 <lufimtse>	:-/
Apr 26 10:33:02 <akurtakov>	how is GtkGLArea doing it ?
Apr 26 10:35:44 <ipun>	akurtakov: yeah it doesnt look like it
Apr 26 10:44:23 <ipun>	lufimtse: would   if (Device.DEBUG && !OS.isX11()) be suffieicent or did you think nesting it would be more legible?
Apr 26 10:44:59 <ipun>	nesting it might be better for future development if there does happen to be support later (if ever)
Apr 26 10:53:29 <lufimtse>	ipun, the above would still create a socket on wayland
Apr 26 10:53:46 <lufimtse>	ipun, what you want is not create a socket on wayland, but also print msg if Device.DEBUG is set.
Apr 26 10:53:54 <ipun>	ah right sorry
Apr 26 10:54:02 <ipun>	i figured my logic was flawed
Apr 26 15:21:26 <ipun>	ericwill:  https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95495/
Apr 27 11:58:47 <ipun>	akurtakov: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=781845
Apr 27 11:58:54 <ipun>	now we wait
Apr 27 11:59:57 <akurtakov>	ipun: so we should get your patch in ?
Apr 27 12:00:08 <akurtakov>	it would at least make it not close imediately
Apr 27 12:00:16 <ipun>	akurtakov: yes the patch i have is independent of that issue
Apr 27 12:00:25 <ipun>	i split the bug up into two earlier i think
Apr 27 12:00:26 <akurtakov>	is the alt-tab issue fixed?
Apr 27 12:00:53 <ipun>	the alt-tab issue is actually related to the gtk bug
Apr 27 12:01:17 <akurtakov>	to this one ?
Apr 27 12:01:22 <ipun>	yeah
Apr 27 12:01:34 <ipun>	its caused by the popup not having focus immediately as intended
Apr 27 12:01:47 <akurtakov>	thus no focus lost on which it's closed ?
Apr 27 12:01:52 <ipun>	so when you alt tab out the signal that launchbar checks for doesnt receive
Apr 27 12:01:55 <ipun>	yes pretty much
Apr 27 12:02:05 <akurtakov>	I see
Apr 27 12:02:12 <ipun>	theres a few ways the popup is closed, and thats one of the ways
Apr 27 12:02:29 <akurtakov>	ipun: would you please contact the gtk guys on irc for their opinion ?
Apr 27 12:02:33 <ipun>	give me a moment to fix up the patch so i can isolate it 
Apr 27 12:02:37 <ipun>	akurtakov: i have, no resp
Apr 27 12:02:42 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 27 12:02:47 <ipun>	ive been grilling them for the past week about it
Apr 27 12:03:06 <ipun>	their recommendation of using popover is not feasible
Apr 27 12:12:07 <ipun>	wow akurtakov that was the quickest rebase from you ive ever seen (unless that was automated)
Apr 27 12:12:43 <akurtakov>	if I only knew how to automate that :)
Apr 27 12:31:58 <ipun>	akurtakov: i ran tests on it and it hasnt caused any additional test errors so it is ready for review
Apr 27 14:41:11 <ipun>	ericwill: even worse is that GridLayout is shared amongst all platforms
Apr 27 14:42:56 <ipun>	i think were going to need to figure out how to get the correct width in GridLayout.java | line 670
Apr 27 14:43:27 <ericwill>	ah yes, I remember this guy
Apr 27 14:43:31 <ericwill>	what a messy method
Apr 27 14:43:54 <ipun>	its likely this might be more then just one layout
Apr 27 15:03:13 <ipun>	lufimtse: im having a bit of trouble building old versiosn of SWT. Im just running build.sh but its saying "No rule to make target 'gnome.c', needed by 'gnome.o'.". Seen this before?
Apr 27 15:53:08 <akurtakov>	ipun: so the issue comes from https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/diff/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse%20SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/graphics/TextLayout.java?id=3b55f60471b210ca4631c9c97fbf4ec77086b0b3 ?
Apr 27 15:54:31 <ipun>	akurtakov: might be, the commits pretty big but i think thats probably hte most relevant one
Apr 27 16:30:32 <ipun>	akurtakov: yup its that exact block
Apr 28 10:15:31 <ipun>	akurtakov: regarding the regression caused by https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=491712 , if i run my eclipse instance in GDK_DPI_SCALE=1.5 , does that mean my junits will also inherit that?
Apr 28 10:16:03 <ipun>	so far my fix hasnt caused any additional junit errors relating to the one it was there to initially fix
Apr 28 10:16:11 <akurtakov>	ipun: just to be sure add it to the junit launchers too :)
Apr 28 10:16:26 <ipun>	akurtakov: yeah i did that too
Apr 28 10:16:34 <akurtakov>	ipun: they should 
Apr 28 10:16:46 <ipun>	okay
Apr 28 10:16:59 <ipun>	let me wrap this up a bit  better and explain my changes
Apr 28 10:41:45 <ipun>	akurtakov: ignore the commit i think i screwd up my commit and it included some other changes
Apr 28 10:42:56 <ipun>	k i think i fixed it
Apr 28 11:01:47 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: please review as I would not have time for it today
Apr 28 11:11:50 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, k
Apr 28 11:11:59 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, is it ok for me to do on monday?
Apr 28 11:12:06 <lufimtse>	was trying to get a few api related things in today.
Apr 28 11:12:22 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: what api ?
Apr 28 11:12:37 <akurtakov>	there are zero chances for new API being added now
Apr 28 11:16:13 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ok, I'll review 
Apr 28 11:16:21 <akurtakov>	ipun: link please
Apr 28 11:16:38 <ipun>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/96039/
Apr 28 11:16:43 <ipun>	akurtakov ^
Apr 28 11:16:54 <akurtakov>	ipun: on it
Apr 28 11:16:58 <ipun>	thanks!
Apr 28 11:19:57 <akurtakov>	ipun: you used bisect to find the commit in question right ?
Apr 28 11:20:16 <akurtakov>	I'm curios how much time this took you
Apr 28 11:22:35 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: so what api do you speak of ?
Apr 28 11:22:50 <lufimtse>	the HOVER_ color stuff
Apr 28 11:22:58 <lufimtse>	kinda been tinkering with the color stuff
Apr 28 11:23:03 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Apr 28 11:23:38 <akurtakov>	rebuild everything
Apr 28 11:25:31 <ipun>	akurtakov: yes i did
Apr 28 11:25:40 <ipun>	surprisingly not that long
Apr 28 11:26:03 <ipun>	i wrote a script that rebuilds swt and moves the binaries while cleaning everything beforehand
Apr 28 11:26:16 <ipun>	rebuildling SWT is a lot quicker than gtk
Apr 28 11:26:44 <akurtakov>	ipun: yeah, but a rough number would help me get some expectations
Apr 28 11:26:49 <akurtakov>	I have never used it so far
Apr 28 11:27:25 <ipun>	akurtakov: id say about 25-30 mins for the 11 bisects
Apr 28 11:27:35 <akurtakov>	not bad
Apr 28 11:27:42 <akurtakov>	thanks for the info
Apr 28 11:27:46 <ipun>	no problerm
Apr 28 11:27:57 <ipun>	i did an hour or so of trying to figure it out myself
Apr 28 11:28:26 <ipun>	it was kind of a last choice, but i realised this would be much quicker than bisecting gtk
Apr 28 11:29:01 <ipun>	also akurtakov i had a bit of help from the comments since he gave me a pretty good estimate of inbetween what versions did it pass/fail

May 04 09:18:13 <akurtakov>	that's a real adventure
May 04 09:18:31 <akurtakov>	how do you debug smth that doesn't happen on your machine and you can't replicate it locally
May 04 09:19:00 <akurtakov>	it's impossible to test smth without dbus on systemd booted distro :)
May 04 09:20:39 <ipun>	jeez thats brutal
May 04 10:28:18 <ipun>	akurtakov: have you happened to have reviewed this? https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95925/
May 04 10:28:41 <ipun>	i got a full fix for the launch bar sorta ready, but might need some of your intuition. Needs this patch first in order to do the full fix

May 08 12:24:49 <ipun>	this bug is not fixable
May 08 12:24:57 <ipun>	just got word from mclassen
May 08 12:24:57 <lufimtse>	ipun, hmmm
May 08 12:25:26 <ipun>	lufimtse: it makes sense though 
May 08 12:25:50 <ipun>	because a toplevel gtk_window can move very far away from another top_level window, how are you going to return the coodinates to that?
May 08 12:26:06 <ipun>	theres no "net" that holds the two together within a range
May 08 12:28:25 <lufimtse>	hmmm
May 08 12:30:04 <ipun>	lufimtse: it only works with SWT.ON_TOP
May 08 12:30:16 <ipun>	which basically maps it to the shell
May 08 12:31:50 <lufimtse>	why with swt.ON_TOP ?
May 08 12:31:56 <lufimtse>	why does it work with?
May 08 12:32:07 <lufimtse>	internet seems down..
May 08 12:32:09 <lufimtse>	meh?

May 09 11:13:38 <ipun>	thanks!
May 09 11:15:19 <lufimtse>	ipun, did you run jUnits for this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95925/
May 09 11:19:53 <ipun>	lufimtse: i believe i did, ill run it again 
May 09 11:22:03 <ipun>	lufimtse: okay yes i did. I do remember doing so. And also this is barred off with !OS.isX11() so it would only affect the junit of 3.20+
May 09 11:23:07 <lufimtse>	yea, only wayland jUnits are interesting.
May 09 11:25:06 <ipun>	lufimtse: updated the commit message

May 09 11:32:16 <akurtakov>	Tuesday: All-day test pass. Nobody should develop or fix anything. Literally spend the entire day testing.
May 09 11:33:36 <akurtakov>	the endgame is pretty heavy process and requires everyone to keep an eye to the process
May 09 11:34:28 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, my bad
May 09 11:34:33 <lufimtse>	I forgot
May 09 11:34:46 <lufimtse>	I read that before, but forgot about it. I should add that to my calendar.
May 09 11:34:49 <lufimtse>	soz.

May 11 10:42:24 <ipun>	lufimtse: so the logic behind having a absolute coordinate scheme so that we can "save" shell positions when exiting eclipse/starting eclipse is met by "no. Wayland does not support that functionality"
May 11 10:44:23 <lufimtse>	hmm
May 11 10:45:13 <lufimtse>	ipun, meh. I guess best we can do is make sure the most vital things of Eclipse work on Wayland, and then see if we can fix up platform.ui elements to adjust accordingly.
May 11 10:45:20 <lufimtse>	like take out the hacky logic in launchbar maybe etc...
May 11 10:45:38 <lufimtse>	if we're hitting walls with Wayland, then we should maybe try to make the best of what we can.

May 18 10:44:43 <ipun>	akurtakov: i might. I tried out a ton of variations on how to fix this issue with the keyboard focus in wayland and Ive come to it that the logic cant be put the else line in line 591:Shell.java
May 18 10:45:18 <akurtakov>	ipun: have you identified place where it can be put ?
May 18 10:48:10 <ipun>	akurtakov: it can be put in setVisible
May 18 10:48:33 <akurtakov>	hmm ok
May 18 10:48:45 <ipun>	ive put it up for review; im trying to figure out a better solution instead of traversing the shell to see if it has editable fields
May 18 10:48:53 <ipun>	i've asked GTK for help, im just waiting on that now
May 18 10:49:01 <akurtakov>	or maybe you can hook it into some gtk signal
May 18 10:50:31 <ipun>	akurtakov: i've been told it needs to be done before gtk_show
May 18 10:51:10 <akurtakov>	ok
May 18 10:51:53 <ipun>	akurtakov: im wondering if its possible to capture the show singal before its sent, otherwise we might have to put it there
May 18 10:51:59 <ipun>	there as in setVisible
May 18 10:52:23 <ipun>	the only small issue is the traversal method. Its using DFS but i dont think its the most "viable" solution
May 18 10:52:33 <ipun>	it works the way its intended to though!

May 18 15:10:18 <ipun>	i think we have a queens uni student from 5 years ago
May 18 15:10:29 <ipun>	Lukas Berk is from Queens hes on perf tools
May 18 15:11:27 <ipun>	hmmm
May 18 15:11:30 <akurtakov>	ah, I know Lukas but I was speaking for the team
May 18 15:11:32 <ipun>	this actually looks like a really cool project
May 18 15:11:40 <ipun>	ah yes, definitely for the team
May 18 15:12:00 <akurtakov>	lberk did the stap-java stuff IIRC
May 18 15:13:22 <ipun>	yeah he did, just spoke with him haha
May 18 15:13:32 <ipun>	coincidentally just happened to be working on something next to me
May 18 15:14:14 <akurtakov>	bed time, ttyt
May 19 11:31:15 <ipun>	akurtakov: who maintains JDT atm?
May 19 11:31:27 *	ipun has some complaints/suggestions
May 19 11:32:05 <akurtakov>	ipun: please open bugs, the jdt guys are hard to work with :)
May 19 11:32:17 <akurtakov>	and really strong on following procedures
May 19 11:32:58 <ipun>	akurtakov: ah i see. Had this chat with Angel from the Che team about a similar issue that Intellij was able to solve
May 19 11:33:11 <ipun>	i will see if they already have a report on it 
May 19 11:33:50 <akurtakov>	what was that ?
May 19 11:34:30 <akurtakov>	ipun: fwiw, there are really important things which we will probably have someone to work on (eventually, probably not this year) :)
May 19 11:34:49 <akurtakov>	but our editor shouldn't be worse in any single topic
May 19 11:36:37 <ipun>	akurtakov: this use case: im typing a method within an object and use ctrl+space to see the autocompletions. I happen to select foo(int a, int b). After selection the brackets are automatically created and i can start adding in my parameters
May 19 11:36:49 <ipun>	say i later realise "oh, i actually meant another method
May 19 11:37:10 <ipun>	so i click at object.foo(a,b) at the end of foo
May 19 11:37:36 <ipun>	and do ctrl+space. I found the proper method called foo2(int a, int b) and select that
May 19 11:38:11 <ipun>	what ends up happening is the editor fills it in like so: object.foo2(___, ___)foo(a,b);
May 19 11:39:31 <ipun>	i had a chat with Jeff about it too, and i think its fair that if both foo and foo2 have the same template param name and object type, it should be asummed that the arguments from foo() are safe to be moved to foo2()
May 19 11:40:00 <akurtakov>	try doing the autocomplete while having ctrl hit
May 19 11:40:08 <akurtakov>	this enables autocomplete overrides
May 19 11:40:18 <akurtakov>	instead of the default autocomplete inserts
May 19 11:40:58 <akurtakov>	ipun: works for you ?
May 19 11:41:57 <ipun>	wow
May 19 11:41:58 <ipun>	it does
May 19 11:42:04 <ipun>	akurtakov: thanks i didnt know that
May 19 11:42:19 <akurtakov>	ipun: you're welcome :)
May 19 11:42:58 <akurtakov>	one thing to send mail to Sopot to tweet from his account as a hint
May 19 11:42:59 <akurtakov>	thanks
May 19 11:43:30 <akurtakov>	we are always looking for content for https://twitter.com/EclipseJavaIDE
May 19 11:45:04 <akurtakov>	ipun: sent to him already :)
May 19 11:45:24 <akurtakov>	how does intellij does it ?
May 19 11:45:30 <akurtakov>	is it easier to find it out ?
May 19 11:46:54 <akurtakov>	does it satisfy your need? I mean is Intellij doing smth else ?
May 19 11:52:33 <ipun>	akurtakov: let me ask 
May 19 11:52:38 <ipun>	some of my coworkers use intellij
May 19 11:52:40 <akurtakov>	https://twitter.com/EclipseJavaIDE/status/849957500241666048
May 19 11:55:22 <akurtakov>	I don't mind netbeans at all
May 19 11:56:06 <akurtakov>	but somehow intellij in my eyes is much like macos - marketing products mostly
May 19 11:56:33 <akurtakov>	I mean all the "benefits" come from better marketing
May 19 11:57:46 <ipun>	akurtakov: okay so i just played around with intellij in regards to what we discussed with a coworker
May 19 11:57:56 <ipun>	basically you dont need to hold ctrl
May 19 11:58:00 <ipun>	it just does it automatically
May 19 11:58:16 <akurtakov>	you can get that in eclipse too
May 19 11:58:32 <akurtakov>	go to Preferences/Java/Content Assist
May 19 11:59:00 <akurtakov>	and switch completion inserts to completion overrides radio
May 19 11:59:15 <akurtakov>	should we make this default is probably a valid question
May 19 11:59:25 <ipun>	oh my gosh
May 19 11:59:34 <ipun>	this definteily should be defaulted
May 19 12:00:46 <akurtakov>	feel free to open bug for that
May 19 12:06:02 <ipun>	akurtakov: okay 
May 19 12:06:20 <ipun>	i just talked to lucas about it too, hes going through vogellas tutorial and even hes like "why is this not defaulted"

May 31 10:59:32 <lufimtse>	ipun, thank you.
May 31 11:31:04 <ericwill>	lufimtse GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark
Jun 01 10:17:00 <ipun>	akurtakov: regarding the swt shell it looks like all wayland shells cant go beyond 110px for some reason
Jun 01 10:17:09 <ipun>	tested it in gtk3-demo
Jun 01 10:17:19 <ipun>	asked on GTK channel no response
Jun 01 10:44:48 <akurtakov>	what do you mean ?
Jun 01 10:45:00 <akurtakov>	eclipse is way biiger than 110px
Jun 01 10:46:39 <ipun>	akurtakov: sorry i mean the other way around
Jun 01 10:47:03 <ipun>	the window has trouble going smaller than 110px width
Jun 01 10:48:20 <ipun>	try running gtk3-demo-> gestures. In x11 you can make it so small its basically 1x1 size
Jun 01 10:48:59 <ipun>	but in wayland there is a minimum width
Jun 01 10:49:17 <ipun>	very annoying, not documented either
Jun 01 10:50:29 <akurtakov>	ipun: regarding https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/98447/
Jun 01 10:50:39 <akurtakov>	my gut feeling is this is recipe for disaster
Jun 01 10:50:59 <ipun>	akurtakov: having the async call?
Jun 01 10:51:19 <akurtakov>	yes, you can  end up with endless cycle
Jun 01 10:52:11 <akurtakov>	as if you do it async it could cause new gtk_changed signal 
Jun 01 10:52:27 <akurtakov>	which would post new async java event and etc.
Jun 01 10:52:48 <ipun>	hmmm...
Jun 01 10:52:50 <akurtakov>	it would depend on the amount of events in the gtk queue whether this would happen or not
Jun 01 10:53:24 <akurtakov>	and whether you have slow enough event handler somewhre 
Jun 01 10:55:03 <ipun>	okay ill try to find a better way
Jun 01 10:55:07 <ipun>	i see your point 
Jun 01 10:56:22 <ipun>	do you have any suggestions of another possible solution?
Jun 01 10:56:41 <akurtakov>	probably bug in gtk_commit logic
Jun 01 11:01:07 <akurtakov>	or in some other handler
Jun 01 11:01:44 <ipun>	kk
Jun 01 11:08:09 <akurtakov>	my first idea is that the whole if not needed
Jun 01 11:08:39 <akurtakov>	but it needs deeper testng
Jun 01 11:09:19 <ipun>	doesnt seem to be a problem in gtk2
Jun 01 11:09:42 <ipun>	you're right though im pretty sure this was left behind from 1.x days as this is forcing a manual update
Jun 01 11:09:43 <akurtakov>	yup
Jun 01 11:09:58 <akurtakov>	I have to run now but will take a look tomorrow
Jun 01 11:10:03 <ipun>	okay sounds good
Jun 01 11:10:05 <ipun>	thanks for the help! :)
Jun 01 11:10:13 <ipun>	wouldnt have thought to remove it
Jun 01 11:11:11 <akurtakov>	one should never make 2 eventloops interfere :)
Jun 01 11:11:21 <akurtakov>	this is what troubled me
Jun 01 11:16:54 <akurtakov>	and after that it's a matter of reading the docs
Jun 01 11:17:39 <akurtakov>	and the docs for the function say it's for "manual" so my thought was so this shouldn't happen in response to signal and removed it
Jun 01 11:17:41 <akurtakov>	hope that helps
Jun 01 11:21:23 <ipun>	yes it does, thanks akurtakov !
Jun 01 11:21:51 <ipun>	so far all junits have passed and running hte snippet works fine, so ill do some more testing within a child eclipse
Jun 01 11:21:54 <ipun>	but its looking good

Jun 06 14:50:16 <ericwill>	so nothing super crazy? :P
Jun 06 14:50:21 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, when are the builds back up?
Jun 06 14:50:32 <akurtakov>	well, if you're going to commit smth 
Jun 06 14:50:42 <akurtakov>	that would require natives rebuild you would better wait
Jun 06 14:50:49 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: once RC4 is out
Jun 06 14:51:40 <akurtakov>	and me and/or Sravan are back from vacation as noone else will work on that AFAIK
Jun 06 14:52:10 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay, good to know :)
Jun 08 10:41:42 <ericwill>	akurtakov when someone switches to the dark theme on GTK, do we set the GTK theme to Adwaita-dark?
Jun 08 10:41:48 <ericwill>	I think I asked you this before but I can't remember :)

Jun 08 14:55:06 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay thanks
Jun 09 10:20:46 <ericwill>	akurtakov hey, if I wanted to merge some small patches am I all clear to go? or do I need to bump a version somewhere?
Jun 09 10:32:00 <akurtakov>	ericwill: you can merge it
Jun 09 10:32:15 <akurtakov>	and bump the swt version like x.y.z+100
Jun 09 10:32:24 <akurtakov>	assuming you're not adding new functionality
Jun 09 10:32:40 <akurtakov>	note that there will be no build
Jun 09 10:32:55 <akurtakov>	for now 
Jun 09 10:33:10 <akurtakov>	although Sravan is wokring on it and hopefully he will be able to get them running today
Jun 09 10:33:14 <ericwill>	akurtakov :)
Jun 09 10:37:56 <ericwill>	akurtakov how do I bump the version, never done that before
Jun 09 10:38:20 <akurtakov>	increase the version in the Manifest.mf and pom.xml
Jun 09 10:38:24 <akurtakov>	that's it
Jun 09 10:39:42 <ericwill>	3.106.0 becomes 3.107.0?
Jun 09 10:40:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: no
Jun 09 10:40:27 <akurtakov>	3.106.0 becomese 3.106.100
Jun 09 10:41:04 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#Guidelines_on_versioning_plug-ins
Jun 09 10:41:33 <akurtakov>	if/when we add new API or we change BREE it will become 107
Jun 09 10:41:53 <akurtakov>	ericwill: note that you have to do it for fragments too 
Jun 09 10:41:55 <akurtakov>	e.g. http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.binaries.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
Jun 09 10:43:43 <ericwill>	akurtakov do I have to do it for that fragment even if I make no change to OS.java?
Jun 09 10:44:05 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yes, swt fragments always keep same version
Jun 09 10:44:15 <akurtakov>	as they are actually containing the java code too
Jun 09 10:44:38 <akurtakov>	org.eclipse.swt host is just an empty shell
Jun 09 10:53:01 <ericwill>	akurtakov like this? https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/98369/
Jun 09 10:53:07 <ericwill>	and https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/99030/
Jun 09 10:53:58 <akurtakov>	ericwill: 1. is ok
Jun 09 10:54:01 <akurtakov>	2 is not
Jun 09 10:54:08 <akurtakov>	you have to do for all fragments :)
Jun 09 10:54:55 <ericwill>	ah, all platforms
Jun 09 11:06:28 <ericwill>	akurtakov for the binaries, build.xml stays untouched right? or also gets bumped?
Jun 09 11:06:50 <akurtakov>	there is no version in build.xml, right?
Jun 09 11:09:22 <ericwill>	there is <property name="version.suffix" value="3.106.0" />
Jun 09 11:09:41 <akurtakov>	so change it there too :)
Jun 09 11:17:18 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ipun: see my comment for the spin button change
Jun 09 11:17:54 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, where?

Jun 09 11:19:18 <akurtakov>	done now
Jun 09 11:24:28 <ericwill>	akurtakov should I file a bug for the version bump?
Jun 09 11:24:45 <akurtakov>	just use the one you will push the change with
Jun 09 11:28:26 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay added
Jun 09 11:28:57 <ericwill>	for the change in SWT, I should bump org.eclipse.swt.examples etc. as well, right?
Jun 09 11:44:56 <ericwill>	akurtakov can I merge my other change now?
Jun 09 11:45:15 <akurtakov>	ericwill: go on
Jun 09 11:45:25 <akurtakov>	no need to bump other bundles
Jun 09 11:45:35 <akurtakov>	they will be bumped on changes in them 
Jun 09 11:49:50 <ericwill>	akurtakov ok, change is in
Jun 09 11:49:55 <ericwill>	for SWT
Jun 09 11:50:41 <akurtakov>	ericwill: push the binaries change too
Jun 09 11:51:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, this is good candidate for backport too

Jun 20 10:09:24 <ipun>	ericwill: no we decided on GdkEventButton
Jun 20 10:09:38 <ipun>	the problem with using a generic GdkEvent(Any) is that there isnt a memmove for that
Jun 20 10:09:57 <ipun>	thats not hard to implement, but I think its better just to do it this way and keep it as a real Gdk Signal

Jun 20 10:13:07 <ipun>	we acted needed a few more attributes in the signal that GdkEventButton has
Jun 20 10:13:25 <ericwill>	that's fine, I was just curious since Leo commented about it yesterday
Jun 20 10:13:26 <ericwill>	+2 from me
Jun 20 10:14:05 <ericwill>	ipun what is your github username
Jun 20 10:14:10 <ericwill>	going to add you to the snippets repo
Jun 20 10:14:12 <ipun>	ericwill: itpun
Jun 20 10:14:20 <ericwill>	kk
Jun 20 10:14:25 <ericwill>	please upload any snippets you have
Jun 20 10:14:30 <ipun>	sure
Jun 20 10:15:11 <ericwill>	https://github.com/ericwill/SWT-snippets
Jun 20 10:15:13 <ericwill>	invite sent
Jun 20 10:29:44 <akurtakov>	ericwill: you mentioned 85% of the warnings fixed
Jun 20 10:29:48 <akurtakov>	is this in master already ?
Jun 20 10:36:50 <ericwill>	akurtakov no
Jun 20 10:36:54 <ericwill>	it's a native change
Jun 20 10:36:58 <ericwill>	can't merge it yet
Jun 20 10:37:08 <akurtakov>	not ready or relen limitation ?
Jun 20 10:37:20 <ericwill>	it's ready
Jun 20 10:37:25 <ericwill>	but I thought the builds aren't ready yet
Jun 20 10:53:38 <akurtakov>	ericwill: should be fine to push now
Jun 20 10:54:52 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay, this is good :) because I have some patches in the queue that have OS.java changes
Jun 20 10:55:09 <akurtakov>	ericwill: please push, the first native build was yesterday
Jun 20 10:55:32 <akurtakov>	and I'm back so I can handle the releng changes if needed
Jun 20 10:55:59 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay will do
Jun 20 11:00:27 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hpux should die :)
Jun 20 11:21:39 <ipun>	lufimtse: could you take a look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/98030/ when you are free?
Jun 20 11:21:53 <lufimtse>	hey
Jun 20 11:21:55 <lufimtse>	lemme see
Jun 20 12:01:51 <akurtakov>	ipun: lufimtse: can you point to the jdt bug refactoring bug where table viewer doesn't enter edit mode?
Jun 20 12:06:32 <akurtakov>	I used it as an example why using deprecated code hurts us
Jun 20 12:06:32 <akurtakov>	and now I need to make proposal what does JDT UI needs to change to 
Jun 20 12:06:32 <ipun>	akurtakov: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=510803
Jun 20 12:06:32 <akurtakov>	as I claimed non-deprecated viewer works
Jun 20 12:06:32 <akurtakov>	ipun: can we make a proposal to jdt.ui to change their code to make it works
Jun 20 12:06:32 <akurtakov>	as IIRC the normal table viewer works
Jun 20 12:08:43 <ipun>	akurtakov: yeah sure. Should the proposal be made on that bug or should I do it as a new bug report on the JDT UI
Jun 20 12:09:18 <akurtakov>	ipun: please let it be new for JDT UI
Jun 20 12:09:54 <akurtakov>	if you can come up with patch that just makes it work by not using deprecated stuff - that would be perfect 
Jun 20 12:10:02 <akurtakov>	I would be able to make Dani shut up :0
Jun 20 12:26:29 <akurtakov>	ipun: so do you think this is feasible to be done in few days?
Jun 20 12:26:55 <akurtakov>	aka feel free to go wild and use JFace stuff directly without caring about JDT UI internal implementations
Jun 20 13:57:20 <ipun>	akurtakov: i can try, ill see what i can do
Jun 20 13:57:46 <ipun>	its been pretty embeded to what has been built, but i don't see a problem with trying to fix this with a newer way
Jun 20 14:00:52 <ipun>	akurtakov: ill let you know once I can give you a better estimate in time
Jun 20 14:28:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hey
Jun 20 14:29:56 <lufimtse>	I'm not exactly sure about the above, but the issue is not in the deprecated viewer, but in SWT somewhere.
Jun 20 14:30:07 <lufimtse>	The same thing can occur on a non-deprecated viewer just as likley.
Jun 20 14:30:12 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Jun 20 14:30:37 <lufimtse>	That bug is on my todo list, will get to it eventually :-)
Jun 20 14:36:49 <ipun>	yeah i just looked at it i forgot that was the issue
Jun 20 14:36:54 <ipun>	something to do with children of a tab folder right?
Jun 20 14:44:35 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I know it's an issue in swt
Jun 20 14:45:09 <akurtakov>	but what i remember is Ian not being able to reproduce it with plain Jface viewer
Jun 20 14:45:22 <lufimtse>	that's because plain viewer didn't use a tabfolder
Jun 20 14:45:24 <lufimtse>	I think
Jun 20 14:45:43 <lufimtse>	but any non-deprecated viewer that uses tabfolder will have the same trouble.
Jun 20 14:45:59 <lufimtse>	Like, the viewer being deprecated is not the issue per-se.
Jun 20 14:46:30 <lufimtse>	if that makes sense.... akurtakov 
Jun 20 14:46:35 <akurtakov>	damn, I needed an example how bad it is that jdt ui to use 
Jun 20 14:46:40 <akurtakov>	deprecated
Jun 20 14:46:47 <lufimtse>	hmmmm
Jun 20 14:46:49 <lufimtse>	I see
Jun 20 14:46:56 <lufimtse>	What's the context?
Jun 20 14:47:27 <akurtakov>	look at it from my pov, I want to push some reasoning in jdt guys that they should start updating their codebase to modernize it
Jun 20 14:47:55 <lufimtse>	I see.
Jun 20 14:48:00 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/PMC
Jun 20 14:48:09 <akurtakov>	we had a heated discussion today
Jun 20 14:48:44 <lufimtse>	I recall fixing a memory leak that was due to a resource not being closed. This could have been detected if newer java interface was used that automatically detects unclosed resources..
Jun 20 14:49:12 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: fwiw, there was a way to follow gerrits for given project
Jun 20 14:49:31 <akurtakov>	that would be easier than others remembering to add you as reviewer
Jun 20 14:49:49 <akurtakov>	I remember I did that myself some years ago but not how :)
Jun 20 14:49:59 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, that's true. I do that. But I can't stop merges in time sometimes X-D
Jun 20 14:50:32 <akurtakov>	well, don't become next Markus
Jun 20 14:50:40 <akurtakov>	if we can improve it later so be it
Jun 20 14:51:05 <akurtakov>	it is really discourages for others if their patch end up in lenghty discussions
Jun 20 14:51:44 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I like Markus :-)
Jun 20 14:51:44 <akurtakov>	it's a really sharp edge between teaching someone and discouraging him
Jun 20 14:51:51 <lufimtse>	but I see your point.
Jun 20 14:52:28 <akurtakov>	while I like his technical expertise and etc.
Jun 20 14:52:34 <lufimtse>	that's true, but sometimes it helps to prevent obvious mistakes as cleaning up later can be more pain. Ex adding api too early...
Jun 20 14:52:41 <akurtakov>	I really hate the fact that he discouraged many many people from contributing to eclipse
Jun 20 14:52:51 <lufimtse>	I see
Jun 20 14:53:15 <akurtakov>	this is long term vs mid term
Jun 20 14:53:37 <akurtakov>	mid term it's best to have the best tech solution we can achieve now
Jun 20 14:54:05 <akurtakov>	long term it's best to gave a number vibrant community
Jun 20 14:55:01 <akurtakov>	today's call was double the usual time
Jun 20 14:55:13 <akurtakov>	as we obviously have to change a lot in how we welcome people
Jun 20 14:55:22 <lufimtse>	I see
Jun 20 14:55:40 <akurtakov>	aka it's normal to have way higher expectation to patches depending on whom they come from
Jun 20 14:55:53 <akurtakov>	aka I can nitpick on patches coming from you
Jun 20 14:56:07 <akurtakov>	as you know there is nothing bad in my intention already
Jun 20 14:56:27 <akurtakov>	while there is no way we know how a random person trying to contribut will get it
Jun 20 14:56:58 <lufimtse>	I see. So be picky with friends and co-workers, but be easy on new commers.
Jun 20 14:56:59 <akurtakov>	so it's most probably more encouraging to accept his change after fixing obvious mistakes
Jun 20 14:57:18 <akurtakov>	and do the details in consequent changes
Jun 20 14:57:34 <akurtakov>	of course there is no silver bullet
Jun 20 14:57:36 <lufimtse>	Interesting.
Jun 20 14:57:43 <lufimtse>	That's an interesting thought there.
Jun 20 14:57:51 <lufimtse>	We should add to Open Organisation book.
Jun 20 14:59:00 <akurtakov>	it's a really big discussion 
Jun 20 14:59:17 <akurtakov>	and we need to act to try encouraging more people to contribute back
Jun 20 14:59:39 <akurtakov>	although whatever path we try it's a guess
Jun 20 14:59:54 <akurtakov>	but one thing is sure current path leads to less contributors
Jun 20 15:00:26 <akurtakov>	if there are ideas about how to make it more atractive for people to contribute I'm all ears 
Jun 20 15:00:37 <akurtakov>	look at it as brainstorming
Jun 20 15:00:58 <akurtakov>	it might be totally discarded or morph into smth different
Jun 20 15:01:13 <akurtakov>	or accepted warmly
Jun 20 15:01:26 <akurtakov>	no one really knows more than - change is needed
Jun 20 15:04:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov a good way is to get university students involved with contributing. it's a good learning experience for them and it builds experience for their resume. and we benefit from the contributions :)
Jun 20 15:08:31 <akurtakov>	ericwill: how do you propose this to happen?
Jun 20 15:09:28 <ericwill>	akurtakov encourage the foundation to go to university career fairs or give talks in lectures
Jun 20 15:09:37 <ericwill>	Leo speaks in some university classes about Red Hat and open source
Jun 20 15:09:38 <akurtakov>	ericwill: forget about it
Jun 20 15:09:39 <ericwill>	something similar
Jun 20 15:09:57 <akurtakov>	we can not rely on foundation to do anything specific to one project
Jun 20 15:10:19 <akurtakov>	they to try to stay away from things that "don't benefit all projects:
Jun 20 15:10:33 <akurtakov>	which is impossible IMHO but they insist on it
Jun 20 15:10:51 <ericwill>	that's too bad, all could benefit from this
Jun 20 15:11:15 <akurtakov>	you can talk to Sopot to hear that they don't want to even bless his twitter account as foundation thing
Jun 20 15:11:34 <akurtakov>	as for them these things are beneficial only for the IDE
Jun 20 15:11:39 <ericwill>	that is quite sad
Jun 20 15:12:01 <akurtakov>	so it's about things we (+friends) can do
Jun 20 15:12:30 <akurtakov>	speaking of eclipse ide - it's our team + Vogella
Jun 20 15:12:41 <akurtakov>	^^ IMHO :)
Jun 20 15:14:16 <ericwill>	Vogella could be a help, he knows that SWT being in good shape is directly tied to the user experience of platform UI
Jun 20 15:14:30 <akurtakov>	btw, if things go according to my plan - you should become committers to whole platform :)
Jun 20 15:14:55 <akurtakov>	I hope that by end of year we will be single project
Jun 20 15:15:05 <akurtakov>	we seem to have an agreement to merge 
Jun 20 15:16:14 <ericwill>	does that mean platform UI committers become SWT committers?
Jun 20 15:16:56 <akurtakov>	it means all platform.* becomes a single committers list
Jun 20 15:17:08 <akurtakov>	and yes to swt committers
Jun 20 15:17:58 <akurtakov>	but this troubles me - in Mandriva we had a single list of committers - everything from kernel to gnome-dictionary or freemind 
Jun 20 15:18:25 <akurtakov>	if you're committer you had access to everything, and people were still acting sensibly
Jun 20 15:18:43 <akurtakov>	not a single failure in more than 2 years of someone breaking things badly
Jun 20 15:19:16 <akurtakov>	in a way it's a matter of trust more than technical expertise
Jun 20 15:19:55 <akurtakov>	but makes changes that need to apply to multiple repos way easier than current find dozen committers to drive a change
Jun 20 15:20:06 <ericwill>	hmm
Jun 20 15:20:27 <ericwill>	only concern I have is that we would get committers who fix SWT by calling redraw() or something similar -- not real fixes
Jun 20 15:21:27 <akurtakov>	yeah, I have heard these concerns 
Jun 20 15:21:47 <akurtakov>	still, have you ever touched macos code ?
Jun 20 15:22:18 <akurtakov>	you would do it only if you're fairly certain in what you do or search competent opinion on it
Jun 20 15:22:49 <akurtakov>	and empowering committers doesn't mean they will abuse it
Jun 20 15:23:11 <akurtakov>	easy things will go faster, more difficult ones will get proper reviews
Jun 20 15:23:19 <akurtakov>	that's my mandriva experience
Jun 20 15:23:25 <ericwill>	that's a good point
Jun 20 15:23:32 <ipun>	akurtakov: its an interesting idea to merge everyone together as one project
Jun 20 15:23:37 <ericwill>	it shouldn't be an issue as long as there is vigilance
Jun 20 15:23:37 <ipun>	but i could see there be faults
Jun 20 15:23:48 <akurtakov>	and I want to believe that eclipse community is at least that much responsible :)
Jun 20 15:23:49 <ipun>	im curious what the numbers of actual contributors are though
Jun 20 15:24:40 <akurtakov>	ipun: https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.platform/who
Jun 20 15:24:59 <akurtakov>	and these are people that have contributed
Jun 20 15:25:11 <akurtakov>	not all of them are committers
Jun 20 15:25:16 <akurtakov>	e.g. like you :)
Jun 20 15:25:58 <ipun>	haha yu
Jun 20 15:26:01 <ipun>	yup
Jun 20 15:26:21 <ipun>	pretty cool visual guide 
Jun 20 15:27:11 <ipun>	but in that regard, I think this community is sensitive enough to not have things breaking badly
Jun 20 15:28:02 <ipun>	i think it could also benefit later if we do merge everything together so that when we refer to "eclipse" we might be able to have more leverage to have the foundation support things like University Fairs because theres less segregation within the community 
Jun 20 15:36:04 <akurtakov>	what I have to add is that e.g. there are many p2 patches that I have to review
Jun 20 15:36:20 <akurtakov>	even though I'm not really confident there
Jun 20 15:36:44 <akurtakov>	if we have single set of committers we can split this work allowing easier/faster/better reviews
Jun 20 15:36:53 <akurtakov>	and this is my ultimate goal
Jun 20 15:38:15 <akurtakov>	if the price for that is some temp issues till we adjust the process
Jun 20 15:38:20 <akurtakov>	it's small price to pay
Jun 20 15:39:43 <ipun>	fair enough 
Jun 20 15:57:37 <ericwill>	akurtakov overall I am in favour of it
Jun 20 15:57:48 <ericwill>	if people break some stuff, just revert :)
Jun 20 16:44:55 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hmm https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/38/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/ColorDialog.java
Jun 20 16:44:57 <akurtakov>	why?
Jun 20 16:45:36 <akurtakov>	I can see later in the code there is different function called for pre 3.4
Jun 20 16:46:02 <ericwill>	akurtakov GdkRGBA support was added in 3.0, but the GtkColorChooserDialog (which uses GdkRGBA instead of GdkColor) was only added in 3.4
Jun 20 16:46:04 <ericwill>	so there is a gap
Jun 20 16:46:32 <akurtakov>	that's not fine
Jun 20 16:47:03 <akurtakov>	can't the guards be adjusted accordingly?
Jun 20 16:47:27 <akurtakov>	I mean gtk_color_chooser_dialog_new  is used only for 3.4+
Jun 20 16:47:47 <akurtakov>	for older versions gtk_color_selection_dialog_new
Jun 20 16:47:48 <akurtakov>	is used
Jun 20 16:48:14 <akurtakov>	so I don't see what the assert is giving us other than breaking 3.0-3.4 range which will use collor selection anyway
Jun 20 16:48:34 <ericwill>	akurtakov it means we will have to use GdkColor Java objects for 3.0 - 3.4, and in GdkColor.java there is a call to GdkColor_sizeof()
Jun 20 16:48:45 <ericwill>	which would crash if this isn't provided on GTK3
Jun 20 16:49:12 <akurtakov>	and why wouldn't it ?
Jun 20 16:49:27 <akurtakov>	I mean it's not fine to just say this api doesn't work for 3.0-3.4 
Jun 20 16:49:37 <akurtakov>	esp when it was owrking previous
Jun 20 16:49:51 <ericwill>	yeah this was something I meant to ask you but forgot
Jun 20 16:50:06 <ericwill>	okay I will fix it
Jun 20 16:50:33 <akurtakov>	ericwill: it's not gonna be big fix , right? 
Jun 20 16:50:41 <akurtakov>	at least I don't think so :)
Jun 20 16:51:14 <akurtakov>	btw, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/38/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Combo.java
Jun 20 16:51:26 <akurtakov>	asserts like that make me a bit nervous
Jun 20 16:51:49 <akurtakov>	will the functions not be reached by the other gtk version with your patch
Jun 20 16:52:10 <ericwill>	akurtakov for the ColorDialog thing: no shouldn't be a big fix
Jun 20 16:52:16 <akurtakov>	I assume so by reading but want to be sure
Jun 20 16:52:24 <ericwill>	for the asserts, yes that's correct
Jun 20 16:52:41 <ericwill>	no code should reach any color function that uses GdkRGBA outside of GTK3
Jun 20 16:52:52 <akurtakov>	ok
Jun 20 16:53:16 <akurtakov>	fwiw, I never used runtime asserts 
Jun 20 16:53:37 <akurtakov>	so I'm kind of unsure how they work :)
Jun 20 16:53:49 <akurtakov>	will they just print to syserr ?
Jun 20 16:55:01 <ericwill>	so with assert
Jun 20 16:55:12 <ericwill>	they only have an effect when you run the JVM with assertions enabled
Jun 20 16:55:30 <ericwill>	and then they print a warning in syserr
Jun 20 16:55:42 <ericwill>	by default Eclipse doesn't run with assertions enabled
Jun 20 16:55:50 <ericwill>	but if you run a JUnit test they are
Jun 20 16:56:42 <akurtakov>	ericwill: have you tested it with gtk older than 3.16? so we are sure that we don't end up in this assertion called on older gtk version 
Jun 20 16:58:37 <ericwill>	yes
Jun 20 16:58:43 <ericwill>	I went back as far as 3.10
Jun 20 16:58:53 <akurtakov>	care to explain https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/38/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/DateTime.java to me
Jun 20 16:59:11 <akurtakov>	the Version >= 3.16 becomes  GTK3
Jun 20 16:59:35 <akurtakov>	this is because we now use RGBA everywhere ?
Jun 20 17:00:04 <akurtakov>	I like it just again confirming my reading :)
Jun 20 17:00:14 <ericwill>	yes, with the patch everything on GTK3 uses GdkRGBA
Jun 20 17:00:22 <ericwill>	everything GTK2 runs GdkColor
Jun 20 17:00:44 <ericwill>	also if you want to run anything with assertions enabled, in the launch config under VM arguments, add "-ea"
Jun 20 17:02:32 <akurtakov>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/38/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/IME.java
Jun 20 17:02:40 <akurtakov>	there are few todos you added :)
Jun 20 17:03:17 <akurtakov>	I guess either leftovers or guards are really due
Jun 20 17:03:37 <ericwill>	ah, looks like I did
Jun 20 17:03:39 <ericwill>	an easy fix
Jun 20 17:03:54 <ericwill>	just move the new GdkColor() bits into the GTK2 guard
Jun 20 17:04:19 *	akurtakov is code reading only now
Jun 20 17:04:32 <akurtakov>	will try it tomorrow, hopefully with your adjustments :)
Jun 20 17:04:44 <akurtakov>	fwiw, proper commit message is due to
Jun 20 17:05:10 <ericwill>	sounds good
Jun 20 17:05:17 <ericwill>	a second set of eyes is very helpful
Jun 20 17:05:23 <ericwill>	especially when having worked on this for so long
Jun 20 17:06:16 <akurtakov>	fwiw, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=518532
Jun 20 17:06:28 <akurtakov>	I'm pushing hard for modernization 
Jun 20 17:06:46 <ericwill>	I saw that, removing GDK drawing will make the code a lot simpler
Jun 20 17:06:51 <ericwill>	especially for things like GC
Jun 20 17:06:52 <akurtakov>	it's a step towards gtk2 removal
Jun 20 17:07:07 <akurtakov>	as gtk2 is used by rhel6 only 
Jun 20 17:07:19 <akurtakov>	and others that opt in but I don't really care about them that much :)
Jun 20 17:07:34 <ericwill>	I will be so happy when we remove GTK2 :)
Jun 20 17:11:09 <akurtakov>	I'm pushing as much as I can
Jun 20 17:11:28 <akurtakov>	while trying to not cross the line where people stop listening and just say no :)
Jun 20 17:11:41 *	akurtakov feels like a politician lately
Jun 20 17:12:20 <akurtakov>	ericwill: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/38/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Widget.java this looks suspicious
Jun 20 17:13:36 <ericwill>	akurtakov I moved it into Control
Jun 20 17:13:41 <ericwill>	line 5020
Jun 20 17:13:44 <akurtakov>	ok
Jun 20 17:14:03 <ericwill>	the foreground machinery is a bit gimped, half of it was implemented in widget, half in Control
Jun 20 17:14:58 <akurtakov>	ericwill: please nuke the sysout https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/38/tests/org.eclipse.swt.tests/JUnit+Tests/org/eclipse/swt/tests/junit/Test_org_eclipse_swt_widgets_Control.java

Jun 20 17:15:46 <ericwill>	oops
Jun 20 17:15:47 <ericwill>	will do
Jun 20 17:19:41 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, there is issue with http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/diff/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse%20SWT%20PI/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/internal/gtk/OS.java?id=56755d505b2f2ece25e1a012100d096898dafaf7
Jun 20 17:20:06 <akurtakov>	long[] value should be long /*int*/
Jun 20 17:20:25 <akurtakov>	swt tools put errors in my workspace for that
Jun 20 17:20:37 <ericwill>	doh
Jun 20 17:20:43 <ericwill>	sorry about that, forgot to enable that setting
Jun 20 17:20:45 <ericwill>	will fix it now
Jun 20 17:20:51 <akurtakov>	I can do it if you want
Jun 20 17:21:00 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay please do
Jun 20 17:26:25 <akurtakov>	ericwill: done
Jun 20 17:26:33 <akurtakov>	with that I wish you good night :)
Jun 20 17:26:46 <ericwill>	akurtakov thanks, I turned my warnings on. good night :)
Jun 21 12:24:39 <akurtakov>	ericwill: lufimtse: please feel free to throw bugs at ipun :)
Jun 21 12:24:58 <akurtakov>	overall, he is tasked with finishing his bugs and helping with the triaging
Jun 21 12:25:09 <lufimtse>	ok
Jun 21 12:25:18 <lufimtse>	:-D
Jun 21 12:25:20 <lufimtse>	ak
Jun 21 12:25:21 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Jun 21 12:25:31 *	ericwill loads a bunch of bugs into his hands and throws them at ipun
Jun 21 12:25:52 <akurtakov>	ericwill: few loads please :)
Jun 21 12:27:00 <akurtakov>	btw, who wants GLCanvas ? it is smth I hope one of you will be able to pick up after new year :)
Jun 21 12:27:12 <akurtakov>	the other one get a11y :)
Jun 21 12:27:19 <akurtakov>	but it's ASAP :)
Jun 21 12:39:10 <ericwill>	I don't think anyone wants a11y :P
Jun 21 12:40:04 <akurtakov>	that could only mean - you both get it :)
Jun 21 12:40:16 <ericwill>	haha, I don't mind working on it once the color port is done
Jun 21 12:40:24 <ericwill>	lufimtse can have GLCanvas
Jun 21 12:40:51 <akurtakov>	yeah, after being done with webkit2 :)
Jun 21 12:44:18 <akurtakov>	btw, how is the color port going ?
Jun 21 12:44:30 <akurtakov>	have you adjusted Leo's comments ?
Jun 21 12:44:36 <ericwill>	akurtakov good, yes I made them
Jun 21 12:44:45 <ericwill>	was just about to say you can try it out again if you like
Jun 21 12:44:59 <akurtakov>	I tried it today and there was nothing broken I spotted
Jun 21 12:45:07 <akurtakov>	will do thorough test later
Jun 21 12:45:18 <ericwill>	okay
Jun 21 12:45:20 <ericwill>	btw
Jun 21 12:45:31 <ericwill>	on GTK2 Table and Tree bg colors do not work
Jun 21 12:45:33 <ericwill>	on master
Jun 21 12:45:38 <ericwill>	(unrelated to color port)
Jun 21 12:45:52 <ericwill>	maybe something ipun can investigate?
Jun 21 12:45:57 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I'm working ont this guy atm btw: Bug 465280 – [GTK3] OS.gtk_widget_get_allocation returns (0,0) for invisible controls
Jun 21 12:45:59 <akurtakov>	meh 
Jun 21 12:46:08 <akurtakov>	I don't care about GTK2 :)
Jun 21 12:46:16 <akurtakov>	tbh, I want to remove it
Jun 21 12:46:29 <akurtakov>	don't bother with gtk2 guys
Jun 21 12:46:39 <akurtakov>	unless someone finds it's your patch that broke it :)
Jun 21 12:47:09 <ericwill>	works for me :)
Jun 21 12:47:44 <akurtakov>	now that we don't have to support RHEL 6 it's of no use for us
Jun 21 12:47:59 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: btw, good new for you - RHEL 7.4 will have webkit2 :)
Jun 21 12:48:23 <akurtakov>	just in time isn't it :)
Jun 21 12:48:29 <akurtakov>	release is in september :)
Jun 21 12:49:05 <lufimtse>	nice
Jun 21 12:49:43 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: are there other things but return js left there ?
Jun 21 12:50:19 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so far no. But it wouldn't hurt for me to go through the whole browser api to make sure it all works.
Jun 21 12:50:31 <akurtakov>	ok
Jun 21 16:22:32 <ericwill>	akurtakov is 4.7 backport branch open for merging yet?
Jun 21 16:22:39 <akurtakov>	ericwill: not yet
Jun 21 16:24:11 <akurtakov>	this is postponed until 4.7 is out officialy so we can handle the extrme case of rebuild on 4.7 for Oxygen.0 if smth really severe hapens
Jun 21 16:25:58 <ericwill>	okay, np :)
Jun 22 10:52:41 <ericwill>	akurtakov: hey, Leo and I were wondering if this can be merged: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/99534/
Jun 22 10:55:31 <akurtakov>	if you're confident in it
Jun 22 10:56:10 <akurtakov>	I have my principal concerns over such tests 
Jun 22 10:56:37 <akurtakov>	aka how well it will work on different versions systems etc.
Jun 22 10:56:48 <akurtakov>	but if you find it valuable - go oon
Jun 22 10:57:00 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what you mean over different version sysetms?
Jun 22 10:57:22 <akurtakov>	well, if the test is specific to gtk
Jun 22 10:57:39 <akurtakov>	what hapens if one runs them on e.g. ubuntu/rhel7/mageial...
Jun 22 10:59:00 <akurtakov>	from releng pov they look stable
Jun 22 10:59:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmm. But in what way would all test be different to gtk specific tests in such context?
Jun 22 10:59:41 <lufimtse>	both would run into the same problem?
Jun 22 11:00:24 <akurtakov>	yeah, I mean if we have tests that are same for all WS we claim this is the right way and the system is offending
Jun 22 11:00:56 <akurtakov>	if we have ws specific tests - it becomes gray area as it obviously it's not specified behavior of swt
Jun 22 11:01:11 <akurtakov>	anyway, this is just thoughts and you're working more on this so it's your call
Jun 22 11:01:35 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I see. I think in such a case, a jUnit test can be made more generic to see the common behaviour.
Jun 22 11:09:52 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: if we can get your +1 for https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76631/45
Jun 22 11:10:02 <akurtakov>	and Eric can push it
Jun 22 11:10:35 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Ok. I'll review.
Jun 22 11:25:34 <akurtakov>	ericwill: getting rgba will not magically enable transparent tooltips, will it ?
Jun 22 11:26:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov not the javadoc ones, since they are not really tooltips :)
Jun 22 11:27:50 <ericwill>	the native tooltips (like when you hover over a button on the eclipse workbench toolbar) are already transparent
Jun 22 12:23:42 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: are launch groups storable in launch file ?
Jun 22 12:24:05 <akurtakov>	that would be nice
Jun 22 12:25:02 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what do you mean?
Jun 22 12:25:14 <lufimtse>	whats a launch file?
Jun 22 12:25:20 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: you know that you can store launch configuration in a file and store it in git
Jun 22 12:26:32 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: like http://git.eclipse.org/c/equinox/rt.equinox.p2.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.equinox.frameworkadmin.test/Framework%20Admin%20Test.launch
Jun 22 12:27:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, that's new info to me.
Jun 22 12:27:19 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, how do you run such a .launch?
Jun 22 12:27:35 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: if you open a project that has such launch file
Jun 22 12:27:48 <akurtakov>	it will be auto added in the launch configurations :)
Jun 22 12:27:54 <akurtakov>	magic is magic :)
Jun 22 12:28:06 <lufimtse>	oh.
Jun 22 12:28:16 <lufimtse>	Interesting. I need to investigate.
Jun 22 12:28:24 <lufimtse>	This could make life a lot easier.
Jun 22 12:29:07 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: there is export wizard 
Jun 22 12:29:22 <akurtakov>	so you can get launch file generated from your existing launch
Jun 22 12:30:18 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah, that's how to get it. Yea, it seems Launch Group is in there.
Jun 22 12:30:34 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, could potentially be used for ALLTests + platformTest.
Jun 22 12:30:42 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: exactly my idea :)
Jun 22 12:30:48 <lufimtse>	with Gtk2/Gtk3 versions.
Jun 22 12:31:06 <akurtakov>	and if hte launch is stored in the platform test bundles voila :)
Jun 22 12:31:24 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, btw, is it possible to have a hudson that also does cocoa/Win32
Jun 22 12:31:28 <lufimtse>	for patch submissions?
Jun 22 12:31:35 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: short: no
Jun 22 12:31:41 <lufimtse>	derp.
Jun 22 12:32:22 <akurtakov>	long: technically there are such machines but they are limited as foundation can not expose windows/mac to the general public like that for licencing issues
Jun 22 12:33:14 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: btw, it would be nice if export was available from the launch dialog
Jun 22 12:33:29 <akurtakov>	as the export wizard is kind of hidden
Jun 22 12:38:41 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I agree. Had a simmilar thought.
Jun 22 12:38:57 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: feel free to open a bug :)
Jun 22 12:39:01 <lufimtse>	X-D
Jun 22 12:39:34 <akurtakov>	Eclipe is full of these nice things but UX is not the best :)
Jun 22 12:39:54 <akurtakov>	and add me on cc to that bug I'll try to get someone on it :)
Jun 22 12:40:06 <akurtakov>	although it should be fairly trivial 
Jun 22 12:41:45 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I'm getting a lot of errors from bugzilla: There was an error sending mail from 'bugzilla-daemon@eclipse.org' to 'dirk.fauth@googlemail.com': Can't send data 
Jun 22 12:41:53 <lufimtse>	?
Jun 22 12:42:04 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: network issue https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.swt-Gerrit/4728/console
Jun 22 12:42:31 <lufimtse>	derp.
Jun 22 12:43:29 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=518652
Jun 22 12:46:20 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I'm getting bugzilla error after every single bugzilla opertion. 
Jun 22 12:46:26 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, do you get that also?
Jun 22 12:46:28 <akurtakov>	yes
Jun 22 12:46:31 <lufimtse>	der.p
Jun 22 12:46:45 <akurtakov>	infra is broken
Jun 22 13:00:01 <akurtakov>	done for today, can't wait to remove gdk draw once rgba work is in :)
Jun 22 13:00:04 <akurtakov>	g'night
Jun 22 14:34:52 <ericwill>	ipun if you are looking for a bug to work on, you can take this one from me: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=494771
Jun 22 14:35:34 <ipun>	ericwill: sure i can take a look. You want to triage for a bit then?
Jun 22 14:35:50 <ericwill>	ipun I might do triage tomorrow, we'll see
Jun 23 11:26:06 <ipun>	ericwill|afk: man this spinner bug guy is...thurough
Jun 23 11:45:27 <ericwill>	ipun haha I saw
Jun 23 11:45:32 <ericwill>	just one of those types of bugs
Jun 23 11:53:38 <ericwill>	lufimtse can we just merge that bug snippet thing and the readme? I want to add some other snippets today
Jun 23 12:25:54 <akurtakov>	ericwill: wow, you spamed swt inbox :)
Jun 23 12:26:11 <akurtakov>	that's so we don't think we are close to being decent :)
Jun 23 12:27:32 <ericwill>	akurtakov haha, I noticed yesterday running the build script that a lot of stuff is deprecated that we don't have bugs for
Jun 23 12:28:54 <ericwill>	a brief glance says most of them are easy fixes
Jun 23 12:50:52 <lufimtse>	hello
Jun 23 12:51:50 <lufimtse>	ericwill, +1 to submitting bug reports. We need to weed out these deprecated functions for gtk4.
Jun 23 12:52:11 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I was having the same thought about the snippet business.
Jun 23 12:52:30 <ericwill>	lufimtse okay, I will merge it
Jun 23 12:52:51 <ericwill>	also just uploaded some revised color port stuff, when you have a chance
Jun 23 12:52:57 <lufimtse>	ok,

Jun 26 10:35:05 <ipun>	akurtakov: what do you think of this guys reasoning for using async in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=517633 ?
Jun 26 10:38:43 <akurtakov>	what is the async? java one?
Jun 26 10:40:35 <ipun>	akurtakov: he wanted to call OS.gtk_spin_button_update() on async instead
Jun 26 10:40:44 <lufimtse>	ipun, I think he mentioned async is one possible solution, not the only one.
Jun 26 10:40:53 <lufimtse>	ipun, afaik, we spoke about using a different signal, no?
Jun 26 10:41:05 <ipun>	lufimtse: tried it already
Jun 26 10:41:11 <lufimtse>	result?
Jun 26 10:41:24 <ipun>	the other signals are only sent on the widget being actually changed after called by gkt_spin_button_update()
Jun 26 10:41:26 <ipun>	so no, it doesnt work
Jun 26 10:42:22 <ipun>	lufimtse: also where did you hear he had mulitple solutions?
Jun 26 10:43:50 <lufimtse>	ipun, let's chat.
Jun 26 10:45:45 <akurtakov>	replied
Jun 26 10:46:46 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: the async is a total no -go 
Jun 26 10:47:01 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: see my reasoning in the bug

Jun 26 12:19:52 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, btw, is backport branch open for backports?
Jun 26 12:20:21 <akurtakov>	no, it will happen after Oxygen is officially released
Jun 26 12:20:32 <akurtakov>	there is still the risk of last minute rebuild
Jun 26 12:20:38 <akurtakov>	so backports can not be allowed
Jun 26 12:27:31 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah. Ok.
Jun 26 13:40:05 <ipun>	ericwill lufimtse anyone that is free, could someone run snippet141 and see if it runs with current gtk and swt versions
Jun 26 13:40:06 <ipun>	?
Jun 26 13:40:32 <ericwill>	ipun sure give me a sec
Jun 26 13:41:23 <ipun>	thanks!
Jun 26 13:41:32 <ericwill>	I get an error
Jun 26 13:41:38 <ericwill>	"There was an error loading the GIF"
Jun 26 13:41:52 <ipun>	hmm okay mine says it cant load the class
Jun 26 13:42:03 <ipun>	im wondering what i should do with this https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=287477
Jun 26 14:21:07 <akurtakov>	fwiw, swt has it's own gif/jpeg implementations
Jun 26 14:31:42 <ericwill>	akurtakov do you know what is going on here? http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/diff/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse%20SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Display.java?h=silenio/Bug389910&id=cd78cc4a8b2e806160de2908244830099a48d3b9
Jun 26 14:31:51 <ericwill>	in the "toGdkColor" method
Jun 26 14:33:47 <ericwill>	seems like some math to convert from HSV to HSL...then back to RGB
Jun 26 14:43:32 <akurtakov>	ericwill: no idea :)
Jun 26 14:43:36 <akurtakov>	was I involved ?
Jun 26 14:45:13 <ericwill>	nope
Jun 26 14:45:20 <ericwill>	akurtakov seems to be conversion with this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV
Jun 26 14:50:53 <akurtakov>	ericwill: so do you think it's no longer needed or smth in it troubles you ?
Jun 26 14:51:14 <ericwill>	akurtakov we still need it, I can't find a suitable replacement
Jun 26 14:51:24 <ericwill>	and Leo pointed out in a patch review that the method makes no sense
Jun 26 14:51:28 <ericwill>	so I am documenting it
Jun 26 14:53:20 <akurtakov>	always good :)
Jun 26 15:05:51 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: there were talks about having image decoders based on gdk-pixbuf
Jun 26 15:06:23 <akurtakov>	as this would give support for latest specs and it would give also way more details properly implemented
Jun 26 15:06:34 <akurtakov>	and quite probably speed up too 
Jun 26 15:06:56 <akurtakov>	but this has always been very low in prio list
Jun 26 15:34:55 <ericwill>	akurtakov do you know what IME is and how I can test it
Jun 26 15:35:04 <ericwill>	I don't see any snippets for it
Jun 26 15:38:53 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmm
Jun 27 09:30:31 <ericwill>	lufimtse good morning, thank you for the patch review
Jun 27 09:37:14 <ericwill>	akurtakov: http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/commit/?id=8f5c12dbbf0d52d77529e8b468c625831e5f4dd0
Jun 27 09:37:15 <ericwill>	:)
Jun 27 09:38:18 <akurtakov>	yay :)
Jun 27 09:38:33 <akurtakov>	one of the most eventfull swt months lately
Jun 27 09:39:01 <akurtakov>	https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.platform.swt/who
Jun 27 09:39:06 <akurtakov>	pretty good for June 
Jun 27 09:40:01 <ericwill>	absolutely
Jun 27 09:41:49 <ipun>	cool i see my name!
Jun 27 09:42:52 <ericwill>	akurtakov you can go ahead and remove GDK drawing now :)
Jun 27 09:43:13 <akurtakov>	ericwill: will do it tomorrow
Jun 27 09:43:36 <akurtakov>	still discussing with Lakshmi how to handle xulrunner removal :)
Jun 27 09:43:41 <akurtakov>	and doing it around the world
Jun 27 09:43:47 <akurtakov>	e.g. launcher was today :)
Jun 27 09:43:59 <ericwill>	perfect
Jun 27 10:10:34 <ipun>	akurtakov: is there any historical reasons why some SWT events are sent as post vs send when retreiving from GTK?
Jun 27 10:10:52 <akurtakov>	ipun: no idea :)
Jun 27 10:11:02 <akurtakov>	I gave up on remembering
Jun 27 10:11:13 <akurtakov>	gut feelings + reading for me :)
Jun 27 10:37:52 <lufimtse>	ipun, send is often used if gtkEvents need a return value. post is usually used if they don't.
Jun 27 10:38:23 <lufimtse>	ipun, but if you change post to send now and vice versa, it can break order of events. So it has to be well justified and tested.
Jun 27 10:51:20 <lufimtse>	ipun, Bug 515396 – [Wayland] dragDetect should block till DnD state is known 
Jun 27 10:51:20 <lufimtse>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=515396
Jun 27 14:00:03 <ericwill>	lufimtse hello
Jun 27 14:00:06 <ericwill>	do you have a minute?
Jun 27 14:36:56 <lufimtse>	hey
Jun 27 14:36:57 <lufimtse>	ericwill, 
Jun 27 14:37:00 <lufimtse>	sap
Jun 27 14:37:35 <ericwill>	lufimtse hey, for the GTK specific JUnits
Jun 27 14:37:43 <ericwill>	I wanted to know if you had naming scheme in mind
Jun 27 14:37:49 <ericwill>	I came up with this so far: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/98569/
Jun 27 14:40:01 <lufimtse>	ericwill, maybe just call it Test_color.java ?
Jun 27 14:40:05 <lufimtse>	or something like that.
Jun 27 14:40:32 <ericwill>	lufimtse I thought maybe something in the name of the class would distinguish it from the cross-platform tests
Jun 27 14:40:34 <ericwill>	idk
Jun 27 14:42:02 <lufimtse>	maybe put the color tests into cross-platform test, but tell it not skip on gtk2.
Jun 27 14:42:12 <lufimtse>	but tell it *to* skip on gtk2
Jun 27 14:42:31 <ericwill>	lufimtse can we do that?
Jun 27 14:42:41 <ericwill>	I thought the gtk guards are in OS.java only
Jun 27 14:42:58 <lufimtse>	I did something similar for webkit2
Jun 27 14:43:06 <lufimtse>	you don't call os.java
Jun 27 14:43:09 <lufimtse>	instead ...
Jun 27 14:43:22 <lufimtse>	use get system property
Jun 27 14:43:33 <lufimtse>	like: String webkitGtkVersionStr = System.getProperty("org.eclipse.swt.internal.webkitgtk.version")
Jun 27 14:43:36 <lufimtse>	but for gtk
Jun 27 14:43:39 <lufimtse>	lemmeeee see
Jun 27 14:43:46 <ericwill>	lufimtse ah yeah
Jun 27 14:43:51 <ericwill>	I know what you are talking about
Jun 27 14:44:06 <lufimtse>	String gtkVersion = System.getProperty("org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.version");
Jun 27 14:44:32 <lufimtse>	see Test_*Browser
Jun 27 14:44:41 <lufimtse>	setUp()
Jun 27 14:44:44 <ericwill>	lufimtse danke
Jun 27 14:44:54 <lufimtse>	I'm setting up cross platform tests atm
Jun 27 14:45:15 <lufimtse>	one thing I didn't quite anticipate is that running jUnits over ssh is not straight forward.
Jun 27 14:45:27 <lufimtse>	it tries to tunnel them etc...
Jun 27 14:45:33 <lufimtse>	gotta find a more creative approach.
Jun 27 14:46:11 <ericwill>	ah yeah that could be tricky
Jun 27 14:46:24 <ericwill>	maybe do it headless?
Jun 27 15:36:16 <ericwill>	akurtakov how often do the hudson test machines on gerrit get updated?
Jun 27 15:36:19 <ericwill>	every night?
Jun 27 15:36:39 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yes
Jun 27 15:37:49 <ericwill>	okay, cool
Jun 27 15:39:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill: unless there is broken build :)
Jun 27 15:39:16 <akurtakov>	in which case I-build repo will not be updated
Jun 27 15:40:14 <ericwill>	akurtakov I was just wondering when I push the JUnit tests with alpha
Jun 27 15:40:20 <ericwill>	it can wait
Jun 27 15:40:28 <akurtakov>	once you see good build
Jun 27 15:44:00 <ericwill>	akurtakov after removal of GDK drawing, what stands in the way of GTK2 removal?
Jun 27 15:44:23 <akurtakov>	people will :)
Jun 27 15:45:05 <ericwill>	ah yes, the political discussions
Jun 27 15:45:36 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I'm looking to remove rhel6 out of the equation by dropping cairo pre 1.10
Jun 27 15:46:07 <akurtakov>	that would silence many people :)
Jun 27 15:50:51 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I'm not pushing too much now 
Jun 27 15:51:06 <akurtakov>	as there are other changes which require pushing 
Jun 27 15:51:16 <akurtakov>	but gtk2 removal is about time
Jun 27 15:51:32 <akurtakov>	and once we have gtk4 betas we will claim it inevitable
Jun 27 15:52:11 <ericwill>	right, makes sense
Jun 28 09:59:58 <lufimtse>	https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/platform-releng-dev/
Jun 28 10:00:19 <lufimtse>	http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/
Jun 28 10:00:25 <lufimtse>	ericwill, builds produced, but not yet linked.
Jun 28 10:00:49 <akurtakov>	I'm working on starting doing 4.7.1 maintenance builds as we speak
Jun 28 10:01:08 <akurtakov>	aiming that all this is fixed by eow
Jun 28 10:02:04 <akurtakov>	after all we have the release today
Jun 28 10:02:08 <akurtakov>	PARTYYY :)
Jun 28 10:03:11 <ericwill>	akurtakov :D
Jun 28 10:03:19 <ericwill>	a good reason to have some beers
Jun 28 10:06:24 <ipun>	oh yeah
Jun 28 10:06:27 <ipun>	todays the day :D
Jun 28 10:06:37 <ipun>	release party on blujeans it is
Jun 29 09:53:05 <akurtakov>	ipun: here ?
Jun 29 09:53:15 <ipun>	akurtakov: hey
Jun 29 09:53:29 <akurtakov>	what are you working on ?
Jun 29 09:54:36 <ipun>	i've been bug triaging this whole week but ive picked up https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=4745
Jun 29 09:54:52 <ipun>	this one is pretty much done im just trying to see if i can set up a windows VM to test how it looks
Jun 29 09:55:08 <ipun>	im waiting for Leo to test it on OSX but hes not in yet
Jun 29 10:02:06 <akurtakov>	please look at TableDragSourceEffect 
Jun 29 10:02:17 <akurtakov>	or TreeDragSourceEffect
Jun 29 10:02:28 <akurtakov>	drawing is in if GTK3 block
Jun 29 10:02:36 <ipun>	there a bug id for that?
Jun 29 10:02:40 <akurtakov>	but doing cairo drawing should be suitable for all
Jun 29 10:02:43 <akurtakov>	no
Jun 29 10:02:48 <akurtakov>	just saw it
Jun 29 10:02:54 <akurtakov>	while looking at other things
Jun 29 10:03:17 <akurtakov>	I don't know how much porting would be needed
Jun 29 10:03:25 <akurtakov>	probably none for the actual drawing
Jun 29 10:03:35 <akurtakov>	but I would expect some "hooking" fun
Jun 29 10:03:43 <akurtakov>	as it doesn't work out of the box :)
Jun 29 10:07:50 <ipun>	okay i will take a look
Jun 29 10:10:59 <akurtakov>	feel free to open a bug
Jun 29 10:11:15 <akurtakov>	it's just smth I found while looking to remove gdkdraw
Jun 29 10:17:19 <ipun>	akurtakov: so did you want to remove cairo or remove the guard?
Jun 29 10:17:22 *	ipun is slightly confused
Jun 29 10:17:34 <akurtakov>	remove the else clause
Jun 29 10:17:39 <akurtakov>	aka not cairo drawing
Jun 29 10:27:30 <ipun>	akurtakov: okay. But still have a solution for GTK2 i assume?
Jun 29 11:03:41 <ericwill>	lufimtse color port tests ready to be reviewed once more
Jun 29 14:19:06 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/
Jun 29 14:19:16 <akurtakov>	4.8 I builds are shown now 
Jun 29 15:14:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ooeee
Jun 29 15:14:40 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: 4.7.1 builds should be up by Tue
Jun 29 15:15:05 <akurtakov>	it involved me requesting resources and pde commit rights so I can speed it up in the future
Jun 30 09:30:30 <akurtakov>	ipun: how is the dnd effect stuff going ?
Jun 30 09:38:54 <ipun>	akurtakov: good, i was just about to msg you
Jun 30 09:39:14 <ipun>	i spent a while on #cairo and #gtk to figure this out
Jun 30 09:39:21 <akurtakov>	so sounds doable?
Jun 30 09:39:50 <ipun>	theres a small problem. The way that GTK gives us the drag icon differs in GTK2 vs GTK3
Jun 30 09:40:13 <ipun>	gtk_tree_view_create_row_drag_icon() is not deprecated and is in both versions, but they return different values
Jun 30 09:40:29 <ipun>	in GTK2 a GDKpixmap is returned, while GTK3 returns a cairo surface
Jun 30 09:41:09 <ipun>	they've dropped support for GdkPixmap for Cairo as of GTK3, which makes it difficult as there is no methods in GTK2 that will give us a cairo surface image instead
Jun 30 09:41:22 <ipun>	their fix was basically for GTK3, which kind of screws things up for us 
Jun 30 09:45:22 <ipun>	what do you think?
Jun 30 09:46:39 <akurtakov>	not sure I follow
Jun 30 09:46:48 <akurtakov>	we work dynamically
Jun 30 09:47:03 <akurtakov>	and GdkPixmap is smth we can use with cairo
Jun 30 09:47:10 <akurtakov>	on gtk2 
Jun 30 09:47:13 <akurtakov>	or not?
Jun 30 09:48:07 <ipun>	so basically in Gtk2 a GdkPixmap is returned, which is deprecated
Jun 30 09:48:13 <ipun>	but, we can convert the pixmap to cairo using gdk_cairo_set_source_pixmap
Jun 30 09:48:19 <ipun>	however, that method is removed in GTK3
Jun 30 09:48:38 <akurtakov>	which is fine
Jun 30 09:48:41 <ipun>	so we will still need a (OS.GTK3) conditional
Jun 30 09:48:45 <akurtakov>	ok
Jun 30 09:48:54 <ipun>	are you okay with that?
Jun 30 09:48:57 <akurtakov>	yes
Jun 30 09:49:03 <ipun>	kk
Jun 30 09:49:10 <ipun>	ill come up with something asap
Jun 30 09:49:13 <akurtakov>	having a cairo drawing (even if pixmap based) on gtk2
Jun 30 09:49:20 <akurtakov>	is better than gdkdrawable
Jun 30 09:49:30 <akurtakov>	which was deprecated even before that :)
Jun 30 09:49:43 <akurtakov>	and it allow me nuke all gdkdrawable stuff :)
Jun 30 09:50:14 <ipun>	sounds good, i think this is very possible then :)
Jun 30 10:06:47 <akurtakov>	one hell of a commit coming guys :)
Jun 30 10:12:45 <akurtakov>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/100472/ 
Jun 30 10:12:55 <akurtakov>	I would appreciate a quick glance
Jun 30 10:16:43 <ipun>	akurtakov: oh my...
Jun 30 10:16:52 <ericwill>	lufimtse ^^
Jun 30 10:20:01 <ipun>	i dont think lufimtse is here
Jun 30 10:20:05 <ipun>	hes not in the office
Jun 30 10:20:20 <ipun>	he'll show up though I talked to him last night
Jun 30 10:20:43 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, mylyn notification background is broken with the latest build
Jun 30 10:22:00 <akurtakov>	ericwill: anyway, I'll push it unless you find issue while I do same surgery to TextLayout :)
Jun 30 10:22:50 <ericwill>	akurtakov screenshot of breakage?
Jun 30 10:23:02 <akurtakov>	ericwill: for mylyn ?
Jun 30 10:23:05 <ericwill>	akurtakov yeah
Jun 30 10:25:42 <akurtakov>	meh, it worked now
Jun 30 10:25:52 <akurtakov>	worst case , doesn't happen everytime
Jun 30 10:26:07 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, open preferences
Jun 30 10:26:38 <akurtakov>	do you see the right column being all white background ?
Jun 30 10:27:11 <ericwill>	window -> preferences?
Jun 30 10:27:15 <akurtakov>	I think it's same thing there 
Jun 30 10:27:17 <akurtakov>	yes
Jun 30 10:28:20 <ericwill>	preferences window looks fine to me
Jun 30 10:28:40 <ericwill>	or is this under some specific preference?
Jun 30 10:29:27 <akurtakov>	ericwill: are you unde rwayland ?
Jun 30 10:30:06 <ericwill>	akurtakov no
Jun 30 10:30:10 <ericwill>	are you?
Jun 30 10:32:38 <akurtakov>	yes
Jun 30 10:33:15 <ericwill>	let me try it, brb
Jun 30 10:35:09 <ericwill>	akurtakov still looks fine to me
Jun 30 10:35:30 <akurtakov>	hmm ok
Jun 30 10:35:35 <akurtakov>	please stay on wayland
Jun 30 10:35:41 <akurtakov>	it might come later :)
Jun 30 10:35:52 <ericwill>	will do
Jun 30 10:35:57 <akurtakov>	good idea in general :)
Jun 30 10:36:31 <ericwill>	a wayland only color bug would be weird
Jun 30 10:36:43 <akurtakov>	it is so awkward
Jun 30 10:37:02 <akurtakov>	my swt involvement started with adding all these ifs for gtk3
Jun 30 10:37:18 <akurtakov>	actually with cairo in gtk 2.18 :)
Jun 30 10:37:31 <akurtakov>	feels like closing the loop now by removing the old stuff
Jun 30 10:38:10 <ericwill>	it's come full circle!
Jun 30 10:43:33 <akurtakov>	yeah
Jun 30 10:43:48 <akurtakov>	so fine to push GC stuff ?
Jun 30 10:44:44 <ericwill>	akurtakov I don't see anything bad looking, you know more about it than me :)
Jun 30 10:44:55 <akurtakov>	:)
Jun 30 10:45:12 <akurtakov>	worst part is probably I'm the only one in the project remembering this shit :)
Jun 30 10:59:27 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I had to restart my ide
Jun 30 10:59:32 <akurtakov>	preferences are now fine
Jun 30 10:59:44 <akurtakov>	so there is smth somewhere causing the issues later
Jun 30 11:00:12 <ericwill>	strange
Jun 30 11:00:28 <ericwill>	not re-drawing properly maybe?
Jun 30 11:02:10 <lufimtse>	ericwill, hello'
Jun 30 11:04:26 <ericwill>	lufimtse hi, it's okay
Jun 30 11:04:32 <ericwill>	Alex already went ahead and merged
Jun 30 11:20:09 <akurtakov>	if you guys don't notice any change I did good job :)
Jun 30 11:24:32 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, so I got the preferences dialog background white again
Jun 30 11:25:04 <ericwill>	akurtakov anything specific to reproduce the issue?
Jun 30 11:25:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: no, regular coding stuff
Jun 30 11:25:25 <akurtakov>	jump to navigation search for references and etc.
Jun 30 11:25:35 <akurtakov>	after an hour doing so I get it repro
Jun 30 11:26:03 <ericwill>	very weird
Jun 30 11:26:13 <ericwill>	if it happens only on Wayland -- even weirder
Jun 30 11:27:43 <ipun>	akurtakov: so its looking more doable to get this done but i might have to rewrite getSourceImage quite a bit, might take a bit longer than a few lines changed
Jun 30 11:28:01 <akurtakov>	hmm
Jun 30 11:28:16 <akurtakov>	that's unexpected :)
Jun 30 11:29:20 <ipun>	yeah basically i have to do some conversion so that might change the actual logic to it
Jun 30 11:29:28 <ipun>	but it shouldnt be a problem, it just might look different
Jun 30 11:30:14 <akurtakov>	you're off on monday, right?
Jun 30 11:30:38 <ipun>	no im gonna be working on monday
Jun 30 11:30:54 <akurtakov>	ok, I'll look into it on monday and we can talk once you appear
Jun 30 11:30:58 <ipun>	sure
Jun 30 12:03:08 <lufimtse>	facebook launched a "workplace" version. Interesting..

Jul 03 09:49:14 *	Now talking on #SWT
Jul 04 10:10:08 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hey Eric
Jul 04 10:10:19 <akurtakov>	would you please install ubuntu in a vm and try 
Jul 04 10:10:32 <akurtakov>	my gut feeling is some weird ubuntu theme issue
Jul 04 10:10:40 <ericwill>	akurtakov already in the process of doing so :)
Jul 04 10:10:47 <akurtakov>	cool
Jul 04 10:10:48 <ericwill>	that is what I think as well
Jul 04 10:11:11 <akurtakov>	ericwill: could it be even transparency
Jul 04 10:11:37 <akurtakov>	now that the colors have transparency and adwaita doesn't define it for anything but tooltip
Jul 04 10:11:59 <akurtakov>	if ambience uses heavy transparency I can envision such problems
Jul 04 10:12:26 <ericwill>	akurtakov I will look into it. all his breakages were custom widgets/SwtFixed only widgets
Jul 04 10:12:35 <ericwill>	so transparency could be it
Jul 04 10:17:26 <ericwill>	akurtakov the issue reproduces on Ubuntu unity
Jul 04 10:17:28 <ericwill>	will try with GNOME
Jul 04 10:18:12 <akurtakov>	I don't expect change if gnome uses ambience and not adwaita :)
Jul 04 10:19:06 <ericwill>	akurtakov GNOME with ambiance broken, adwaita works
Jul 04 10:19:11 *	ericwill sighs
Jul 04 10:19:28 <akurtakov>	as expected :)
Jul 04 10:20:13 <ericwill>	akurtakov what is the procedure with this, do we fix it?
Jul 04 10:20:24 <akurtakov>	yeah, we would better fix it
Jul 04 10:20:40 <akurtakov>	ubuntu is one of the target environments
Jul 04 10:20:44 <akurtakov>	so it should work out of the box
Jul 04 10:21:06 <ericwill>	okay, I'll look into it
Jul 04 10:21:18 <ericwill>	can't wait for Ubuntu to start using GNOME :)
Jul 04 10:21:39 <akurtakov>	ericwill: well, and Adwaita (ideally)
Jul 04 10:21:48 <akurtakov>	ambience is an abomination :)
Jul 04 10:22:28 *	akurtakov can't get people liking the orange color randomly in the UI
Jul 04 10:22:32 <akurtakov>	is it still like that ?
Jul 04 10:22:38 <ericwill>	yes
Jul 04 10:22:41 <ericwill>	it is so ugly
Jul 04 10:22:43 <ericwill>	I can't stand it
Jul 04 10:23:39 <akurtakov>	seeing UI like that being liked makes me believe I can be a world class artist one day :)
Jul 04 10:24:37 <ipun|laptop>	akurtakov: I'd love to see that haha
Jul 04 10:24:39 <ericwill>	I don't who decided on orange, of all colors
Jul 04 10:24:44 <ericwill>	*I don't know
Jul 04 10:38:05 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so is backport branch open now? Do you know?
Jul 04 10:38:12 <akurtakov>	ipun: if ambience is designer work, I 'm leonardo da vinci :)
Jul 04 10:38:28 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: according to sravan , he needs few more hours
Jul 04 10:38:33 <akurtakov>	tbh, I don't know what is he doing 
Jul 04 10:38:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ah, ok.
Jul 04 10:55:01 <akurtakov>	ericwill: it gets better and better :)
Jul 04 10:55:33 <ericwill>	akurtakov I am very curious as the cause of this
Jul 04 11:00:33 <ipun>	akurtakov: i should just call you alex da vinci from now on
Jul 04 11:01:04 <akurtakov>	ericwill: transparency or some color not initialized
Jul 04 11:01:25 <akurtakov>	look in the color tab in control example on ubuntu
Jul 04 11:01:38 <akurtakov>	some constant should be quite weird
Jul 04 11:01:40 <akurtakov>	 :)
Jul 04 11:03:47 <ericwill>	akurtakov that is what I am doing right now haha
Jul 04 11:09:30 <akurtakov>	ericwill: let me know of anything you find
Jul 04 11:09:57 <ericwill>	akurtakov system colors look normal
Jul 04 11:32:48 <ericwill>	akurtakov actually nvm, I was looking at the wrong thing. I found some breakages
Jul 04 12:02:47 <akurtakov>	ericwill: what it is ?
Jul 04 12:06:51 <ericwill>	akurtakov 7 system colors are broken, I am looking into the cause
Jul 04 12:07:06 <ericwill>	doesn't seem to be a transparency issue
Jul 04 12:07:11 <akurtakov>	good
Jul 04 12:07:20 <akurtakov>	that should be easier to fix
Jul 04 12:07:23 <ericwill>	yes
Jul 05 10:42:15 <ipun>	akurtakov: do you know what type of widget this diagram viewer is using? https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=517671
Jul 05 10:42:36 <akurtakov>	probably canvas

Jul 18 09:50:17 *	Now talking on #SWT
Jul 18 10:09:18 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hey Leo
Jul 18 10:09:26 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hello
Jul 18 10:09:32 <akurtakov>	how are things going ?
Jul 18 10:09:38 <lufimtse>	Good good. Whats up
Jul 18 10:09:51 <akurtakov>	do you have all the test machines setup?
Jul 18 10:10:28 <lufimtse>	~Sorta. Maven still doesn't read correct env on windows box. Only works if I hard-code it in feature.xml
Jul 18 10:10:41 <lufimtse>	me/Roland debugged yesterday a bit, but could not find root cause
Jul 18 10:10:44 <lufimtse>	yet...
Jul 18 10:10:52 <lufimtse>	but linux/cocoa work.
Jul 18 10:11:21 <akurtakov>	did Roland told you that the way tests are run is not with maven for upstream ?
Jul 18 10:11:53 <lufimtse>	on windows?
Jul 18 10:12:01 <lufimtse>	like via build.xml?
Jul 18 10:12:34 <lufimtse>	Essentially, I'm just looking to run jUnits programtically on windows in some form or fashion. 
Jul 18 10:12:44 <lufimtse>	doing it manually is very time consuming
Jul 18 10:13:29 <akurtakov>	via test.xml and testrunner
Jul 18 10:13:48 <lufimtse>	is it quick to setup or difficult? you know?
Jul 18 10:14:15 <lufimtse>	I fiddled around with test.xml very briefly, couldn't get it to work, something about missing libs. Did you ever get it working?
Jul 18 10:14:31 <akurtakov>	we have it in eclipse-tests.rpm in fedora
Jul 18 10:14:38 <akurtakov>	and Roland did a fair bit of work on it
Jul 18 10:14:45 <lufimtse>	that's interesting
Jul 18 10:14:48 <akurtakov>	what else are you up to?
Jul 18 10:15:16 <akurtakov>	anything else stopping ou from webkit2 work?
Jul 18 10:15:20 <lufimtse>	Bunch of patch reviews. E.g this one: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/22713/
Jul 18 10:15:26 <akurtakov>	any eta on it being feature complete ?
Jul 18 10:15:38 <lufimtse>	Just the testing business. 
Jul 18 10:15:49 <lufimtse>	after that webkit2's browser function
Jul 18 10:15:50 <akurtakov>	I ask as I don't wnat it to prolong and we miss the boat again :)
Jul 18 10:15:54 <lufimtse>	ah
Jul 18 10:15:55 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 18 10:15:56 <lufimtse>	ok, 
Jul 18 10:16:06 <lufimtse>	Ill prioritise webkit2's browser function
Jul 18 10:16:09 <lufimtse>	's return value
Jul 18 10:17:14 <akurtakov>	well, reviews are not that time consuming are they?
Jul 18 10:17:22 <lufimtse>	Some are :-)
Jul 18 10:17:33 <akurtakov>	I mean they are not taking more than 1-2 h from your day or they do?
Jul 18 10:17:56 <lufimtse>	Usually not, with some exceptions, 
Jul 18 10:18:00 *	akurtakov would be surprised if people are that fast with responses :)
Jul 18 10:18:10 <lufimtse>	the one above took me half a day or
Jul 18 10:18:16 <lufimtse>	had a memory leak in there
Jul 18 10:18:21 <lufimtse>	but good patch
Jul 18 10:18:27 <lufimtse>	it's for the highest voted swt linux bug
Jul 18 10:18:41 <lufimtse>	I'm also the tester for those 
Jul 18 10:19:19 <lufimtse>	For now I'll try to get something working for windows jUnits and focus on finishing of webkit, will pause other activities.
Jul 18 10:19:48 <akurtakov>	well, perfect wold be still doing other things but not for 1-2 h per day 
Jul 18 10:20:01 <akurtakov>	so nothing stops and waits :)
Jul 18 10:22:09 <akurtakov>	ericwill: what about you ?
Jul 18 10:22:19 <akurtakov>	color port looks good ?
Jul 18 10:22:35 <akurtakov>	I don't see the white background anymore
Jul 18 10:22:41 <akurtakov>	until not yesterday or today
Jul 18 10:23:21 <ericwill>	akurtakov there are some small issues on isolated themes, but yes regular GTK theme should be working nicely
Jul 18 10:23:26 <ericwill>	I am working on them now
Jul 18 10:24:41 <ericwill>	once the color issues are ironed out I am planning on starting with a11y work
Jul 18 10:24:53 <akurtakov>	ericwill: did you deal with tree stuff last year ?
Jul 18 10:25:08 <akurtakov>	ah, yes a11y - that beast :)
Jul 18 10:26:02 <ericwill>	akurtakov yeah I did a lot of tree fixes last year
Jul 18 10:26:15 <akurtakov>	ok, I'll probably open some fun stuff for you :)
Jul 18 10:26:35 <ericwill>	okay :P
Jul 18 11:09:13 <akurtakov>	ericwill: lufimtse: it's that time when we should do planning for Photon
Jul 18 11:09:19 <akurtakov>	for SWT
Jul 18 11:09:29 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Jul 18 11:09:42 <akurtakov>	so Webkit2 by default, A11y
Jul 18 11:10:19 <akurtakov>	what about Notifications? or Opengl?
Jul 18 11:11:12 <ericwill>	akurtakov I was going to ask you about notifications
Jul 18 11:11:16 <ericwill>	I'd be interested in working on that
Jul 18 12:39:44 <akurtakov>	ericwill|lunch: lufimtse: do you think it's reasonable expectation to get all these done by March ?
Jul 18 12:44:16 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I would need to evaluate Opengl work to figure out how long it would take. Evaluating might take a while as I have not worked with OpenGL before, 
Jul 18 12:44:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I can say Webkit2 be done.
Jul 18 12:44:24 <lufimtse>	thou.
Jul 18 12:46:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov hard to say, a11y is so big and I am not sure what exactly is the issue there
Jul 18 12:46:30 <ericwill>	could take me a long/short time
Jul 18 12:46:50 <akurtakov>	I see
Jul 18 12:47:05 <akurtakov>	I'll try to get notifications started soonish
Jul 18 12:47:20 <akurtakov>	and get at least initial POC for gtk
Jul 18 12:48:20 *	akurtakov hopes to start next week after catching up post vacations
Jul 18 13:54:15 <ericwill>	akurtakov do you know anything about this THEME_BACKGROUND state in Widget.java?
Jul 18 13:54:26 <ericwill>	I asked about it on the mailing lists but no one answered
Jul 18 14:51:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: sorry, nothing I remember
Jul 18 14:54:03 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay, np
Jul 18 15:14:08 <akurtakov>	ericwill: btw, any progress on the gdk warnings?
Jul 18 15:15:09 <ericwill>	akurtakov no, I kind of ran into a wall on that issue. GTK complains about size being below min size, but all the fixes I've attempted have broken little things elsewhere
Jul 18 15:15:31 <akurtakov>	hmm ok
Jul 18 15:23:11 <ericwill>	akurtakov it's still on my list, I'll revisit it later after thinking about it some more
Jul 18 15:23:17 <akurtakov>	ok

Jul 20 10:18:58 <akurtakov>	^^ looks like your stuff :)
Jul 20 10:22:38 <ericwill>	akurtakov hmm okay, will investigate
Jul 20 10:22:53 <akurtakov>	ericwill: 3.14 is this AFAIK
Jul 20 10:25:41 <ericwill>	yes I believe so
Jul 20 10:29:55 <ericwill>	akurtakov btw I made some progress on the warnings yesterday
Jul 20 10:29:59 <ericwill>	without changes in os_custom.c
Jul 20 10:30:05 <ericwill>	looks promising
Jul 20 10:30:33 <akurtakov>	ericwill: nice, I can't wait to see less of these :)
Jul 20 10:38:38 <akurtakov>	ericwill: everyone sees this today https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.ui-Gerrit/13231/testReport/ :)
Jul 20 10:39:47 <ericwill>	akurtakov I think I know what is causing the issue, won't take me long to fix
Jul 20 10:47:50 <akurtakov>	ericwill: good :)
Jul 20 10:47:57 <akurtakov>	I'll keep bugging :)
Jul 20 11:07:34 <ericwill>	akurtakov fixed it

Jul 20 12:15:35 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I'll take a looks
Jul 20 12:15:44 <akurtakov>	cool, thanks
Jul 20 12:26:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Hey. Do you know, for backports, do I need to bump service version for every commit, or only once per 4.7.x release? e.g https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/99982/3
Jul 20 12:26:37 <akurtakov>	only once
Jul 20 12:26:44 <lufimtse>	thx
Jul 20 17:30:05 <ericwill>	akurtakov that latest comment on the CDT hover bug...so is it a GTK theme problem?
Jul 21 08:49:19 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hey Eric
Jul 21 08:49:26 <akurtakov>	any progress on the white background
Jul 21 08:49:58 <ericwill>	akurtakov you mean the debug  hover thing that Andrey reported? I am looking into it now
Jul 21 08:50:10 <akurtakov>	ericwill: fwiw, mylyn notifications on first appearance seems to have wrong background 
Jul 21 08:50:14 <akurtakov>	fixes after that
Jul 21 08:51:31 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yeah the debug hover
Jul 21 08:52:30 <ericwill>	akurtakov I am investigating. I can see some sort of issue with 3.14 on Fedora, but it's not unreadable. I have a RHEL 7.2 VM I can try with as well
Jul 21 08:52:52 <akurtakov>	ericwill: AFAIK Andrey uses kde 
Jul 21 08:52:56 <akurtakov>	any maybe gtk2 :)
Jul 21 08:53:46 <ericwill>	I think now he is using RHEL 7.2 with GTK3.14
Jul 21 08:53:50 <ericwill>	but he uses non-Adwaita theme
Jul 21 08:54:25 <akurtakov>	ok
Jul 21 08:57:14 <ericwill>	akurtakov these debug hovers are still supposed to be black, right? they didn't get changed to white
Jul 21 08:57:17 <ericwill>	in platform UI?
Jul 21 08:57:24 <akurtakov>	I think so
Jul 21 08:57:47 <akurtakov>	well, probably it depends on the debugging plugin in question
Jul 21 08:58:02 <akurtakov>	as I can ensure you the dltk.ruby one does nasty things :)
Jul 21 08:58:56 <ericwill>	ha
Jul 21 08:59:01 <ericwill>	okay that is what I thought as well
Jul 21 08:59:12 <ericwill>	not seeing the bug on Fedora, let me try RHEL with his theme
Jul 21 09:09:44 <ericwill>	thought I had a RHEL 7.2 VM, turns out it's actually RHEL 7.4
Jul 21 09:09:45 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 21 09:10:03 <ericwill>	let me try with this theme on Fedora
Jul 21 09:10:08 <ericwill>	*his theme
Jul 21 09:10:33 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I added you on cc to one bug yesterdya
Jul 21 09:10:44 <akurtakov>	it was about some color not being parsed from some theme
Jul 21 09:11:00 <akurtakov>	could be smth similar
Jul 21 09:11:17 <ericwill>	the CDT hover bug right?
Jul 21 09:11:28 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yea
Jul 21 09:14:52 <ericwill>	hmm
Jul 21 10:34:27 <ericwill>	lufimtse heya, are you on PTO next week?
Jul 21 10:34:38 <lufimtse>	I have training
Jul 21 10:34:44 <lufimtse>	./forgot to mention.
Jul 21 10:34:45 <lufimtse>	Will do.
Jul 21 10:36:13 <ericwill>	so you are on PTO next week?
Jul 21 10:37:19 <lufimtse>	It's not counted as vaccation days. 
Jul 21 10:37:30 <lufimtse>	but in that sense, yes 
Jul 21 10:37:42 <lufimtse>	I'll be back friday 1 pm

Jul 21 10:38:27 <ericwill>	:)
Jul 21 10:39:36 <lufimtse>	ericwill, can you check the eclipse calendar, does my PTO show up for next week?
Jul 21 10:40:19 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hmm, are you taking PTO to take RHCSA ?
Jul 21 10:40:40 <ericwill>	lufimtse yes I see it on the calendar now
Jul 21 10:41:17 <lufimtse>	akurtakov it's a training instructor lead course
Jul 21 10:41:18 <lufimtse>	yes
Jul 21 10:44:02 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I asked Martha to check with you
Jul 21 10:44:15 <akurtakov>	but taking courses shouldn't cost you PTO :)
Jul 21 10:44:51 <lufimtse>	ok, confusion. I"m not taking PTO, but I'm doing the course and I won't be in the office.
Jul 21 10:45:14 <ericwill>	yeah sorry about that, I should have said "away" instead of PTO :)
Jul 21 10:45:55 <akurtakov>	ok :)
Jul 21 10:46:11 <akurtakov>	I just make sure things are clear :)
Jul 21 10:47:37 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Thanks for clarification. I mixed up PTO with OOO. I thought PTO==OOO.
Jul 21 10:47:40 <lufimtse>	I updated calendar 
Jul 21 10:47:51 <lufimtse>	"OOO - Leo Ufimtsev"
Jul 21 10:48:07 *	akurtakov doesn't want people in the team to lose PTO for work related things :)
Jul 21 11:22:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Are we good to merge: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/85603/4 ?
Jul 21 11:22:15 <lufimtse>	I removed pom.xml
Jul 21 11:22:20 <lufimtse>	changes
Jul 21 11:22:23 <lufimtse>	and added ignore
Jul 21 11:22:27 <lufimtse>	and clarified assert
Jul 21 11:42:01 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: looks like it
Jul 21 13:13:30 <ericwill>	lufimtse do you have time to review one of my patches today?

Jul 28 15:56:40 <lufimtse>	ericwill, yea, I just saw. My jni talk also got accepted.
Jul 28 15:56:49 <lufimtse>	ericwill, next week we be busy.
Jul 28 15:59:16 <lufimtse>	ericwill, I just noticed that gerrit kinda feels like gmail. Like if you press shift+?, the same keyboard help pops up. Most of the keyboard shortcuts are the same. Gerrit was made by google I think, which kinda explains it.
Jul 28 16:02:43 <ericwill>	hmm, good to know

Aug 01 11:13:15 <akurtakov>	it's really rare
Aug 01 11:13:20 <akurtakov>	do you use mylyn?
Aug 01 11:13:34 <ericwill>	I have the task list installed for testing some things but I don't really use it at all
Aug 01 11:13:36 <akurtakov>	mylyn notifications seems to be the most common 
Aug 01 11:13:52 <ericwill>	hmm I'll look into it
Aug 01 11:14:01 <ericwill>	this bug is very elusive :)
Aug 01 14:54:00 <ericwill>	akurtakov I wrote a script that pulls in the daily I-build test results and parses them for failures
Aug 01 14:54:09 <ericwill>	so you don't have to email me when the e4 tests fail or something
Aug 01 14:58:14 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, I just check the web :)

Aug 02 15:06:35 <ipun>	lufimtse: when you were working on webkit, did you do anything related to user-agents/
Aug 02 15:06:48 <lufimtse>	ipun, no
Aug 04 11:33:31 <ericwill>	lufimtse fixed those issues you filed today, only one left to handle is the test names without stacktraces
Aug 04 11:33:40 <ericwill>	thank you for the feedback :)
Aug 04 11:37:05 <lufimtse>	X-D

Aug 08 09:58:32 <ericwill>	akurtakov which version of Eclipse started enforcing GTK3 by default? Mars?
Aug 08 09:59:17 <akurtakov>	the one from 2014 :)
Aug 08 10:00:22 <akurtakov>	ericwill: I think it was Luna :)
Aug 08 10:01:44 <ericwill>	akurtakov okay thanks
Aug 08 10:01:53 <ericwill>	akurtakov did you see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=470031#c23 ?
Aug 08 10:02:16 <akurtakov>	ericwill: yeah, but I was waiting on your reaction :)
Aug 08 10:02:36 <ericwill>	I will tell him what I know so far and see what he says
Aug 09 11:28:17 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hey Eric
Aug 09 11:28:32 <akurtakov>	so you're moving on with accessibility stuff
Aug 09 11:28:41 <akurtakov>	do you have better idea what's going on ?
Aug 09 11:28:52 <ericwill>	akurtakov I haven't heard anything yet from Sravan
Aug 09 11:28:56 <ericwill>	eh..a little :)
Aug 09 11:30:43 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ok, I would not push too much but I'm just curious
Aug 09 11:32:05 <ericwill>	akurtakov how the SWT a11y code interacts with GTK is still a mystery to me
Aug 09 11:32:11 <ericwill>	that's what I am trying to figure out now
Aug 09 11:37:32 <akurtakov>	g'luck :)
Aug 09 11:38:22 <ericwill>	ha, thanks :P
Aug 09 12:00:45 <akurtakov>	guys, everything you want for 4.7.1 must be in this week 
Aug 09 12:00:46 <akurtakov>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=517487

Aug 09 12:02:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill|lunch: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=481824 for 4.8 I would say?
Aug 09 12:02:23 <akurtakov>	ericwill|lunch: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=470031 same?

Aug 09 12:20:58 <akurtakov>	ericwill: please retarget 
Aug 09 12:30:57 <ericwill>	akurtakov done
Aug 09 12:31:04 <akurtakov>	thanks
Aug 09 12:31:13 <akurtakov>	why do we have a release every week :)
Aug 09 12:31:23 <akurtakov>	I can barely keep up with the dates :)
Aug 09 12:33:20 <ericwill>	yeah
Aug 09 12:33:24 <ericwill>	I try to backport my stuff ASAP to avoid forgetting about these things
Aug 09 14:48:15 <lufimtse_>	ericwill, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/60704/
Aug 09 14:48:26 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, hudson builds seem to be failing as of: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/60704/
Aug 09 14:49:00 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: I simply removed it as reviewer and pushed https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/102801/
Aug 09 14:49:07 <akurtakov>	if it's only this failure
Aug 09 14:49:22 <akurtakov>	Niraj merged fix and test change together
Aug 09 14:50:02 <lufimtse_>	I see
Aug 09 14:50:06 <lufimtse_>	so wait till tomorrow?
Aug 09 14:50:22 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: if there is just this failure, remove hudson as reviewer and push
Aug 09 14:50:33 <akurtakov>	I'm tired of waiting for stuff :)
Aug 09 14:50:33 <lufimtse_>	I see
Aug 09 14:50:37 <lufimtse_>	ok
Aug 09 14:50:47 <akurtakov>	we have lost too much time trying to play nice :)
Aug 09 14:52:16 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: I've changed the config of the hudson job to publish the junit results to it's easier (one click away) to spot the failing tests now :)
Aug 09 14:56:32 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, you mean when you open the hudson build, click on the "Test Result" next to the clipboard?
Aug 09 14:58:36 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: yes, it wasn't there for older builds https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.swt-Gerrit/5087/ 
Aug 09 15:03:15 <lufimtse_>	oh
Aug 09 15:03:19 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, very useful
Aug 09 15:03:20 <lufimtse_>	thank you
Aug 09 15:03:44 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, btw, I don't seem to have rights to remove hudson. Should I be having those?
Aug 09 15:03:53 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: you should be able
Aug 09 15:03:58 <akurtakov>	how do you try to do it?
Aug 09 15:04:17 <lufimtse_>	there is no "x" next to hudson
Aug 09 15:04:27 <lufimtse_>	but there is one next to my name
Aug 09 15:05:00 <akurtakov>	hmm, no idea
Aug 09 15:05:08 <akurtakov>	every committer should be able to do it
Aug 09 15:05:15 <akurtakov>	please ask ericwill to try
Aug 09 15:05:31 <lufimtse_>	ericwill, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/98260/
Aug 09 15:05:47 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, Eric cannot
Aug 09 15:05:48 <ericwill>	I can't
Aug 09 15:05:50 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, can you?
Aug 09 15:06:05 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, maybe I need to request some permissions
Aug 09 15:06:06 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: I do it for my gerrits
Aug 09 15:06:13 <akurtakov>	which one do  you want me to try ?
Aug 09 15:06:16 <lufimtse_>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/98260/
Aug 09 15:07:24 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, I can remove Eric, but not Hudson
Aug 09 15:07:39 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: I removed it
Aug 09 15:07:50 <akurtakov>	well, open bz
Aug 09 15:08:02 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, ok
Aug 09 15:08:05 <akurtakov>	I seriously thought every committer was able to do it
Aug 09 16:04:58 <lufimtse_>	ipun, have you tested this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/100078/ with regular ccombo boxes that don't have read only property?
Aug 09 16:05:29 <ipun>	lufimtse_: no I havent, but thast a good case 
Aug 09 16:05:35 <ipun>	ill see what inheriently GTK does
Aug 09 16:06:03 <lufimtse_>	I'll post into gerrit review. When tested, please post your findings into the gerrit review and I'll test on other platforms.
Aug 09 16:11:53 <ipun>	lufimtse_: oh wait nevermind, ive definitely tested this with regular combo boxes. I read your comment wrong
Aug 09 16:12:02 <ipun>	I thought you meant testing it on regular "combo" boxes
Aug 09 17:06:39 <lufimtse_>	no, I mean ccombo not read only
Aug 10 10:20:21 <ipun>	lufimtse_: how did you access git through your windows machine?
Aug 10 10:20:30 <ipun>	this is paaiinnffull
Aug 10 10:40:18 <lufimtse_>	ipun,   remember to   cd /mnt/c/git/

Aug 10 13:04:22 <ipun>	lufimtse_: sure. I don't see this being any issue unless the builds are failing but ill review it
Aug 10 13:10:09 <ipun>	lufimtse_: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=304893 whos carolyn?
