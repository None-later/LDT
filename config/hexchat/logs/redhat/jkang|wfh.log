[jkang|wfh has address ~jkang@ovpn-125-28.rdu2.redhat.com]
Oct 22 16:28:55 <jkang|wfh>	please e-mail jkang@redhat.com in any work-related e-mails
Oct 22 16:29:10 <jkang|wfh>	may as well remove 21.jiekang@gmail.com from the address book or contacts list thing
Oct 22 16:29:24 <lufimtse>	derp
Oct 22 16:29:29 <lufimtse>	I failed.
Oct 22 16:29:29 <jkang|wfh>	regarding JMC and OpenJDK, it is available in 11+
Oct 22 16:29:30 <lufimtse>	will do.
Oct 22 16:29:35 <jkang|wfh>	JDK 11+ that is
Oct 22 16:29:41 <lufimtse>	I see. Do you know much about visualvm?
Oct 22 16:29:41 <jkang|wfh>	JFR is available in 11+
Oct 22 16:29:48 <jkang|wfh>	JMC is standalone and runs on anything
Oct 22 16:30:03 <jkang|wfh>	VisualVM is also standalone and available
Oct 22 16:30:12 <jkang|wfh>	it has been open source for quite some time
Oct 22 16:30:22 <lufimtse>	good to know.
Oct 22 16:30:32 <jkang|wfh>	for more details: JFR is an internal JVM system for recording events
Oct 22 16:30:45 <jkang|wfh>	it is available in Oracle JDKs, and OpenJDK 11+
Oct 22 16:30:53 <lufimtse>	ah
Oct 22 16:30:58 <lufimtse>	kewl.
Oct 22 16:31:05 <jkang|wfh>	JMC is able to read JFR recording files to display information
Oct 22 16:31:25 <jkang|wfh>	JMC itself is just an Eclipse Plugin-based application; it can run on most JVMs, 8+
Oct 22 16:31:40 <jkang|wfh>	but obviously it's not too useful without any JFR recordings to read
Oct 22 16:31:55 <jkang|wfh>	it does have JMX support, which does not need JFR, but the capabilities are limited
Oct 22 16:32:08 <jkang|wfh>	lot's of acronyms starting with J, sorry
Oct 22 16:32:13 <lufimtse>	ha ha
Oct 22 16:32:15 <jkang|wfh>	read carefully! :P
Oct 22 16:32:26 <lufimtse>	for some reason John Kennedy comes to mind. 
Oct 22 16:32:54 <jkang|wfh>	looks like Deepak responded actually
Oct 22 16:33:00 <jkang|wfh>	didn't even notice the CC
Oct 22 16:33:22 <jkang|wfh>	but yeah, we are planning to have JMC available as an RPM in RHEL systems... eventually (tm)
Oct 22 16:33:28 <lufimtse>	ah
Oct 22 16:33:28 <lufimtse>	nice
Oct 22 16:33:39 <lufimtse>	please write a red hat developer blog post when you guys do it.
