Mar 07 15:51:17 <smcbrien>	dberry: it's back.
Mar 07 15:51:29 <dberry>	smcbrien, thx
Mar 07 15:51:49 <smcbrien>	dberry: I didn't do anything and it came back, but I'm going to have ops take a closer look at it as I see some troubling monitoring alerts coming from it starting at about 1500 Eastern.
Mar 07 15:52:10 <dberry>	smcbrien, yes it is working now

Mar 08 09:11:39 <hevs>	ping role - hey guys Is ROLE page Unavailable for you too?
Mar 08 10:29:57 <smcbrien>	hevs|ooo: We've been seeing intermittent issues with the server, and while we have it 'working' we're doing some additional analysis to try and determine root cause.
Mar 09 02:17:26 <Sayali>	ping #role- team | I can see message as "41 days remaining in your subscription", what steps do I need to do renew the subscription ?
Mar 09 02:28:47 <jschormo>	Sayali, if that is a customer subscription, afaik, for some of them there is a button Renew, for others they have to contact their Sales representative...but...if you speak about subscriptions provided on RH internal accounts, I am not sure who to contact
Mar 09 02:55:47 <Sayali>	jschormo, its for my own role account
Mar 09 02:56:38 <jschormo>	Sayali, then I don't know...maybe talk to your colleagues or manager it they know more
Mar 09 02:58:22 <Sayali>	jschormo, can you point me to the correct channel where I can find team which works with ROLE
Mar 09 03:07:53 <jschormo>	Sayali, here should be ppl that works for ro.le...I just wanted to clear out what type of renewal you need
Mar 09 03:26:58 <Sayali>	ohk jschormo++ thanks :)

Mar 09 15:03:08 <wise>	ping role hey all! I have a customer on the phone that forgot his login ID and he also can't access the portal (so login to make a case). what do you all suggest?
Mar 09 15:04:30 <mrafeeq>	wise: please provide him this link https://www.redhat.com/wapps/sso/lostPassword.html
Mar 09 15:05:51 <wise>	mrafeeq Is the login the same as the training ID number?
Mar 09 15:06:48 <wise>	because now the customer is telling me that he can log in, but he needs the training ID number @.@
Mar 09 15:07:34 <mrafeeq>	wise:  ask customer to open a ticket with us @ rol-support@redhat.com will take care
Mar 09 15:09:06 <wise>	mrafeeq++ he decided just now to let someone else deal with it lol! thanks for your help :)
Mar 09 15:10:49 <mrafeeq>	wise: np
