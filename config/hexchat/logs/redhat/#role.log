Mar 09 02:55:47 <Sayali>	jschormo, its for my own role account
Mar 09 02:56:38 <jschormo>	Sayali, then I don't know...maybe talk to your colleagues or manager it they know more

Mar 23 11:25:31 <smcbrien>	gunslinger: they should open a support case, setting the product to "Red Hat Online Learning" to get it routed to the right people.
Mar 23 11:26:25 <smcbrien>	gunslinger: but there are a variety of things that could be happening, not having a more exact error message makes any triage here unpossible.

Apr 24 13:51:30 <jzaher>	Hello,  I was wondering if anyone had heard of the lab setup scripts not being able to power on the various VMs for CL210
Apr 24 15:32:21 <smcbrien>	jzaher: is this for you or for a customer case?
Apr 24 15:32:56 <jzaher>	smcbrien++ it's for me
Apr 24 15:33:20 <smcbrien>	jzaher: you're on RHU-ROLE?
Apr 24 15:33:24 <jzaher>	correct
Apr 24 15:34:12 <smcbrien>	One sec ...
Apr 24 15:34:56 <jzaher>	I deleted the lab environment and re-provisioned it, and of course it's working now.  But 9/10 times, power manipulation with the setup scripts do not work.
Apr 24 15:51:10 <smcbrien>	jzaher: That may be a function of your environment more than the infrastructure.
Apr 24 15:51:51 <smcbrien>	jzaher|brb: also, even though the machines are 'booted' and you can log into them, the openstack services may not be up or up correctly.  You'll want to check those as your first stop anytime you're troubleshooting.
Apr 24 16:30:54 <jzaher>	smcbrien: but the problem is that the machines never get "powered on".  The setup script just hangs there.  And if I manually power on one of them, say the controller, then it hangs when it tries to power on the next node.
Apr 24 18:09:36 <smcbrien>	jzaher|away: Right.  I'd suggest, if you're having issues with setup scripts that you look at openstack-services status to make sure your stack services are straight before the script (which may or may not check depending on the author) gets run again.  It is not uncommon for things to take 10-20 minutes to 'normalize' after boot.  Systemd kicks a bunch of stuff off in parallel, so just because you can log into the machine, it doesn't mean 
Apr 24 18:09:36 <smcbrien>	it's actually booted.
Apr 25 10:35:19 <Atalique|chat>	yuvab, cu is on chat asking for update on case 02086310 | Please look into it.

Jun 05 07:51:53 <yuvab>	Hello
Jun 05 07:52:02 <yuvab>	what is the issue
Jun 05 07:52:02 <hdalwadi>	yuvab, Hi :)
Jun 05 07:52:38 <yuvab>	Please provide me with the details
Jun 05 07:54:14 <hdalwadi>	yuvab, My Cu (Account Number - 1460771) has purchased 2 x RHLS - Standard. I can see that same in Cu's account but unfortunately, Cu is not able to use the same. They did login to their account, but they are not seeing any subscription.
Jun 05 07:55:18 <hdalwadi>	yuvab, How to check which Cu's user is eligible to use RHLS.
Jun 05 07:55:56 <yuvab>	I will check and let you know give me a minute or 2
Jun 05 07:56:06 <hdalwadi>	yuvab, Great :)
Jun 05 07:56:07 <yuvab>	I will check with the account number provided 1460771
Jun 05 07:56:11 <yuvab>	np
Jun 05 07:58:47 <yuvab>	hdalwadi, we have received the request and waiting for the RHN ID's so that we can go ahead and provide the access for the 2 users
Jun 05 08:00:14 <hdalwadi>	yuvab, On which e-mail this communication was sent? Cu told me they did not receive any e-mail. I am going through this FAQ - https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/docs/rhls-faq
Jun 05 08:01:19 <yuvab>	This request is with our operations team and I checked with them on this
Jun 05 08:03:43 <yuvab>	when i checked with the Operations team with the provided account number they can see several RHN ID's on that so they are waiting for the correct RHN ID to provide with the access for the accounts
Jun 05 08:11:16 <hdalwadi>	yuvab, So, on which e-mail address Cu can send RHN ID for RHLS confirmation?
Jun 05 08:12:22 <yuvab>	Let me check 
Jun 05 08:13:28 <hdalwadi>	yuvab Ok.
Jun 05 08:17:29 <yuvab>	hdalwadi, thank you for your patience, can I know customers region
Jun 05 08:18:02 <yuvab>	So that I can guide them to concerned team
Jun 05 08:18:02 <hdalwadi>	yuvab, CEMEA ( Cu is form Kingdom Saudi Arabia)
Jun 05 08:18:30 <hdalwadi>	yuvab, Ok.
Jun 05 08:20:16 <yuvab>	Please suggest to cu to drop an email with the details to <training-emea-role@redhat.com>, so that they can help customer on the access issues.
Jun 05 08:20:44 <yuvab>	hdalwadi, let me know if you further assistance on this
