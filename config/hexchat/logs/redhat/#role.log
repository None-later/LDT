Mar 09 02:17:26 <Sayali>	ping #role- team | I can see message as "41 days remaining in your subscription", what steps do I need to do renew the subscription ?
Mar 09 02:28:47 <jschormo>	Sayali, if that is a customer subscription, afaik, for some of them there is a button Renew, for others they have to contact their Sales representative...but...if you speak about subscriptions provided on RH internal accounts, I am not sure who to contact
Mar 09 02:55:47 <Sayali>	jschormo, its for my own role account
Mar 09 02:56:38 <jschormo>	Sayali, then I don't know...maybe talk to your colleagues or manager it they know more
Mar 09 02:58:22 <Sayali>	jschormo, can you point me to the correct channel where I can find team which works with ROLE
Mar 09 03:07:53 <jschormo>	Sayali, here should be ppl that works for ro.le...I just wanted to clear out what type of renewal you need
Mar 09 03:26:58 <Sayali>	ohk jschormo++ thanks :)

Mar 09 15:03:08 <wise>	ping role hey all! I have a customer on the phone that forgot his login ID and he also can't access the portal (so login to make a case). what do you all suggest?
Mar 09 15:04:30 <mrafeeq>	wise: please provide him this link https://www.redhat.com/wapps/sso/lostPassword.html
Mar 09 15:05:51 <wise>	mrafeeq Is the login the same as the training ID number?
Mar 09 15:06:48 <wise>	because now the customer is telling me that he can log in, but he needs the training ID number @.@
Mar 09 15:07:34 <mrafeeq>	wise:  ask customer to open a ticket with us @ rol-support@redhat.com will take care

Mar 23 11:20:01 <gunslinger>	ping #role, I have a customer that is having trouble downloading a gluster eBook from what appears to be clicking a link that says 'download custom-watermarked student guide for your personal use' and it's not downloading.  Is this something someone here can help with?
Mar 23 11:25:31 <smcbrien>	gunslinger: they should open a support case, setting the product to "Red Hat Online Learning" to get it routed to the right people.
Mar 23 11:26:25 <smcbrien>	gunslinger: but there are a variety of things that could be happening, not having a more exact error message makes any triage here unpossible.
Mar 23 11:26:39 <gunslinger>	smcbrien, I have the case and switched it to the role sbr but no one has picked it up.
Mar 23 11:26:57 <gunslinger>	The customer has not been very forthcoming with answers to my questions.
Mar 23 11:27:17 <smcbrien>	gunslinger: They have something like a 1 hr ack. internally.  It's a sev 4, so ...
Mar 23 11:27:26 <smcbrien>	gunslinger: what is the customer's RHN ID?
Mar 23 11:27:55 <gunslinger>	smcbrien, the case is 02056388 if someone can take a look
Mar 23 11:30:14 <achyut>	sure
Mar 23 11:31:36 <achyut>	gunslinger: You will need to change the Owner to blank and keep the ticket as New
Mar 23 11:31:47 <achyut>	or people might miss it like in this case
Mar 23 11:31:51 <gunslinger>	achyut, will do
Mar 23 11:32:54 <gunslinger>	achyut, tyvm
