Jul 26 05:53:13 <PiyushB>	akurtakov, around ?
Jul 26 06:13:55 <PiyushB>	trying to get this eclipse 3.2 running, not sure where issue is... http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/395942
Jul 26 06:20:13 <mbooth>	"[root@ESMAD7IV04 ~]# eclipse"
Jul 26 06:20:35 <mbooth>	PiyushB: Did you mean to run Eclipse as root?
Jul 26 06:20:47 <mbooth>	It's generally not a good idea
Jul 26 06:20:57 <PiyushB>	mbooth, yes its root
Jul 26 06:21:34 <akurtakov>	PiyushB: that's not supported 
Jul 26 06:21:45 <akurtakov>	in later versions we added code to actually prevent it
Jul 26 06:21:50 <akurtakov>	mbooth: good catch
Jul 26 06:22:12 <akurtakov>	PiyushB: once you run it as root it will screw its metadata (on ancient versions)

Jul 26 06:23:04 <akurtakov>	PiyushB: running as root once it will screw for non-root too
Jul 26 06:23:26 <akurtakov>	please uninstall eclipse, make sure there is nothing left in libdir/eclipse
Jul 26 06:23:28 <mbooth>	PiyushB: There's a good chance you will need to re-install it since the master p2 profile might be screwed
Jul 26 06:23:36 <akurtakov>	install again and try again as non root

Jul 26 12:26:35 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff ! I'm running the maven build on master branch for the Docker tooling (after pulling the latest changes) and I have 3 or 4 errors (depending on the build). Do you have the same results locally ? 
Jul 26 12:26:42 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: welcome back :)
Jul 26 12:26:55 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks !
Jul 26 12:27:33 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: sorry, I did not see you online when writing the message to Jeff. I guess I read too fast the list of online pple
Jul 26 12:27:45 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: yes, welcome...I haven't seen any build errors in hudson
Jul 26 12:28:04 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok.. damn'it.. 
Jul 26 12:28:15 <rgrunber>	what kind of error (test, building, ..)
Jul 26 12:28:29 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: rgrunber: test failures, actually
Jul 26 12:28:37 <xcoulon>	Tests in error:
Jul 26 12:28:37 <xcoulon>	  BuildDockerImageShortcutSWTBotTest.shouldDisableCommandOnFirstCallWhenMissingConnection:99 » WidgetNotFound
Jul 26 12:28:37 <xcoulon>	  EditDockerConnectionSWTBotTest.shouldUpdateLaunchConfigurationWhenConnectionNameChanged:349->configureRunImageLaunchConfiguration:146 » ClassCast
Jul 26 12:28:37 <xcoulon>	  ImageRunSWTBotTest.shouldReportErrorIfContainerWithSameNameExists:97 » Timeout
Jul 26 12:29:10 <xcoulon>	but I see that there's a new dialog saying that there's no connection, asking to create a new one, and I suspect it might cause some issue with SWTBot
Jul 26 12:29:23 <xcoulon>	issue or side effect, to be more accurate
Jul 26 12:29:56 <jjohnstn>	yes, that would make sense
Jul 26 12:30:51 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok, so before pushing a new version of my work for issue 496922 (I changed my code after your review), I'll probably submit a fix for the test failures. ok for you ?
Jul 26 12:31:12 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: yes, that's fine
Jul 26 12:31:44 <rgrunber>	there's a new dialog for build launch shortcut that links to new connection wizard if no connections exist at all.
Jul 26 12:31:49 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: rgrunber: do you remember which issue/patch brought this dialog ? 
Jul 26 12:32:25 <rgrunber>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/77638/
Jul 26 12:32:59 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: Meeting tomorrow will be 30min earlier
Jul 26 12:34:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks !
Jul 26 12:38:23 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: jjohnstn: may I ask.. should the shell be labelled "No Docker connection exists" (singular) or "No Docker connections exist" (plural) ? 
Jul 26 12:38:59 <xcoulon>	because we have both singular and plural messages and I wonder if both are valid in English ;-)
Jul 26 12:40:21 <rgrunber>	both seem right to me.. i guess i went with "no docker connections exist" though..
Jul 26 12:40:51 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: ok, thanks for clarifying. I'll probably rename the other label to be consistent with your, then
Jul 26 12:40:53 <rgrunber>	technically i think "no docker connecion exists" is better since the requirement is that at least one be present..
Jul 26 12:41:02 <xcoulon>	ha ok
Jul 26 12:41:09 <xcoulon>	so I'll edit it, then

Jul 26 12:43:52 <akurtakov>	doing that in the swt.binaries repo will rebuild the natives and put them in the proper places

Jul 26 13:38:50 <mbenitez>	nboldt, hi Nick! thanks for being so involved in the conversations :)
Jul 26 13:39:35 <mbenitez>	nboldt, re: the rpm work, we'll have a planning mtg tomorrow to get some more details into what we expect to achieve when, let's go from there
Jul 26 13:42:28 <nboldt>	mbenitez: excellent, thanks
Jul 26 13:42:46 <mbenitez>	np!
Jul 26 13:42:58 <nboldt>	btw, I use pidgin so if you ever see I'm not on IRC it could be because pidgin has silently crashed (often when VPN goes down)
Jul 26 13:43:14 <nboldt>	in that case, there's email/hipchat as backup :D
Jul 26 13:43:16 <mbenitez>	tomorrow we can find a victim ^W volunteer to help you :)
Jul 26 13:43:44 <nboldt>	I thought the victim was Matt Booth, as thrown into the volcano by akurtakov
Jul 26 13:44:03 <nboldt>	mbooth: ^
Jul 26 13:44:18 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thanks for letting me know, I believe in letting people be offline so if there was something that needed your attention I'll send a note for sure
Jul 26 13:44:31 <mbooth>	:-)
Jul 26 13:44:52 <akurtakov>	my bad, I miscalculated that rhscl alpha deadline is friday
Jul 26 13:44:53 <mbenitez>	nboldt, yes, Mat will help you, he's just been super busy preparing the dts/rhscl hand off for this Friday
Jul 26 13:45:14 <nboldt>	mbenitez: cool. could also be that I'm on another screen and not seeing the chihuahua-like blinking pidgin cursor notifying me of @mentions
Jul 26 13:45:31 <mbenitez>	haha
Jul 26 13:45:35 <akurtakov>	nboldt: I'll let other things aside and try to have simple spec file for usage tomorrow
Jul 26 13:45:53 <nboldt>	hey, no worries. we still have 6 weeks before devstudio has to be done for the next GA release ... two more sprints to go
Jul 26 13:46:05 <mbenitez>	nboldt, if you have specific questions at any point don't hesitate to just throw them here, anyone who's done pkg work will help
Jul 26 13:46:48 <akurtakov>	hmm, rgrunber is too calm when we speak for howto generate droplets :)
Jul 26 13:46:59 <nboldt>	I guess I need to get a vm with Fedora24 on it (currently do most work on F20) so I can actually use the rpm? what's your toolset for working with rpms and specfiles? (I think I've used the Eclipse specfile editor once.)
Jul 26 13:48:15 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: if that was calm.. imagine how i feel now that i'm discovering all these minor bugs.
Jul 26 13:49:03 <akurtakov>	nboldt: f24 is a prereq yes
Jul 26 13:50:07 <nboldt>	damn. OK. I'll go find an .iso and more disk space
Jul 26 13:50:10 <rgrunber>	mbooth: btw do you remember when we had a discussion with jeff about cdt not symlinking some thing (maybe lpg-java).. and we both agreed on something.. then never spoke of it again.
Jul 26 13:50:37 <nboldt>	...and some free time to set it up... and to migrate my ~/ folder to it... *sigh*
Jul 26 13:51:46 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Erm... now you're really quizzing me...
Jul 26 13:52:06 *	mbooth tries to remember what he had for breakfast...
Jul 26 13:52:22 <rgrunber>	mbooth: that convo is the reason i now set autolog on
Jul 26 13:52:42 <mbenitez>	nboldt, fun times :) if you need anything [other than time] let me know
Jul 26 13:52:54 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I'm sure there's a million entries if I grep my logs for "symlink" :-(
Jul 26 13:53:43 <rgrunber>	hmm maybe cdt.. jjohnstn , long story short cdt-parsers stuff is not started because symlink to lpg-java isn't in any of the cdt plugins/ folders
Jul 26 13:54:02 <rgrunber>	yet the 'requires' exist in the rpm metadata..
Jul 26 13:54:42 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Hmm, actually I remember a conversation about freemarker...
Jul 26 13:54:52 <mbooth>	Or was that something different
Jul 26 13:55:14 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i fixed freemarker according to the commits..
Jul 26 13:55:20 <rgrunber>	for arduino
Jul 26 13:56:21 <rgrunber>	umm nvm can't find it but i fixed some symlinks..
Jul 26 13:58:27 <rgrunber>	anyways it looks like i'd have to debug fedoraproject-p2 or at least rebuild with -X to figure out why symlink is not generated.. so just wanted to see if anyone remembered the convo before i go down that rabbit hole.
Jul 26 14:07:21 <mbenitez>	akazakov, hi Alexey, I updated the calendar invite for tomorrow, I added those who've been in the conversation so far, let me know if I missed anybody or just go ahead and add them
Jul 26 14:07:49 <akazakov>	mbenitez, thanks!
Jul 26 14:07:59 <akazakov>	I also added Jeff.
Jul 26 14:08:18 <mbenitez>	sounds good :)
Jul 26 14:10:09 <mbenitez>	akazakov, re: mailing list I can subscribe people [I think] could you please just email me the names?
Jul 26 14:10:35 <akazakov>	mbenitez, sure
Jul 26 14:17:16 <akazakov>	mbenitez, sent the list

Jul 26 15:54:23 <nboldt>	hey, dumb question... any recommendations for a better IRC client that works on both fedora and windows10?
Jul 26 15:54:39 <ericwill>	nboldt I think Hexchat is Linux and Windows
Jul 26 15:58:29 <nboldt>	ericwill: but is it good? can it hold channels open persistently even if i minimize them? @notifications? logging? 
Jul 26 16:00:31 <nboldt>	ah, I see that's a yes for autoconnect & join on startup
Jul 26 16:01:01 <ericwill>	nboldt yup, should do all of that
Jul 26 16:01:27 <ericwill>	minimizes to the tray and will show a balloon notification when you get pinged
Jul 26 16:02:12 <rgrunber>	is that fancy windows bash thing good enough to run irssi ? :P
Jul 26 16:02:47 <nboldt>	maaybe
Jul 26 16:02:57 <nboldt>	otherwise there's cygwin, mingw, git bash, ...
Jul 26 16:03:34 <nboldt>	and that embedded linux bash thing *cough* ubuntu */cough*
Jul 26 16:05:05 <lufimtse>	nboldt, I haven't tried Hexchat on Windows, but works well on linux OS.g_object_get (settings, WebKitGTK.geometry, geometry, 0);
Jul 26 16:05:12 <lufimtse>	^ https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html
Jul 26 16:05:18 <lufimtse>	wrong clipboard content lol.
Jul 26 16:05:29 <nboldt>	lol, thannks

Jul 27 09:26:46 <mbenitez>	xcoulon, hi, Jeff is on pto until next Tuesday
Jul 27 09:27:21 <xcoulon>	mbenitez: ha ok… I saw him online and I did not know he was on PTO
Jul 27 09:27:36 <xcoulon>	mbenitez: thanks
Jul 27 09:27:52 <mbenitez>	xcoulon, yes :) that is very confusing, Roland should be in soon, maybe he can help you

Jul 27 09:59:20 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: hello Roland. Would you mind giving a look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77972/ ? 
Jul 27 09:59:53 <xcoulon>	also, I sent a couple of mails this morning but we should discuss about them when Jeff comes back from PTO. Ok for you ?
Jul 27 10:01:56 <rgrunber>	was just about to send email, basically http://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs_2#Evolving_API_interfaces_-_API_methods
Jul 27 10:05:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks for the link. But from my understanding, adding a method in IDockerConnectionSettingsFinder breaks the compatibility, right ?
Jul 27 10:08:40 <rgrunber>	exception is if it doesn't need to be implemented by clients then it's only breaking source compatibility or contract compatibility.
Jul 27 10:09:17 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: how does this method addition changes from what I proposed in my patches ?
Jul 27 10:09:25 <rgrunber>	i could just make it internal and not expose it at all.
Jul 27 10:09:31 <xcoulon>	s/changes/change/
Jul 27 10:10:12 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: what I'm trying to understand is if this is a valid addition or not, since all my proposals were rejected.
Jul 27 10:11:50 <rgrunber>	we'll find some way around getting the change in... worst case we just have to not expose any new methods through the interface.
Jul 27 10:12:44 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: "we'll find some way around getting the change in... " <- ok, fine. Then we can do the same on IDockerConnection and IDockerImage, ok ?
Jul 27 10:13:55 <rgrunber>	we can do the same thing.. just not add them to the public api for 5.1
Jul 27 10:14:10 <xcoulon>	ok

Jul 27 12:42:21 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I think you'll want to skip all the changes in the SWTBot tests, it's really a matter of dealing with all the new connection created by the new extension points that you added
Jul 27 12:48:39 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_mtg4: mbenitez: akazakov akurtakov: would a better name for the "A" RPM be devstudio-root? 
Jul 27 12:48:57 <nboldt>	or devstudio-stem?
Jul 27 12:49:08 <akurtakov>	what's "A"
Jul 27 12:49:13 <akurtakov>	the shared one ?
Jul 27 12:49:17 <nboldt>	yes
Jul 27 12:49:25 <nboldt>	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EguQBtlIOXCz5CGCoAO3MEWDnNXITv0st6dhIk8Cwac/edit# scroll to near the bottom
Jul 27 12:49:47 <mbenitez>	I like the root idea but shouldn't it be eclipse? since it's platform
Jul 27 12:50:00 <mbenitez>	+ other common components
Jul 27 12:50:05 <nboldt>	right... 
Jul 27 12:50:08 <akurtakov>	that's implementation detail, which comes from the scl metapackage
Jul 27 12:50:11 <nboldt>	so devstudio-eclipse-common ?
Jul 27 12:50:35 <nboldt>	akurtakov: I know it's an implementation detail, I'm just wondering what the best name for it would be 
Jul 27 12:50:44 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, agreed that it's implementation detail, I think nboldt just wants to clarify
Jul 27 12:50:54 <mbenitez>	and it would help so we all know what we're talking about
Jul 27 12:50:59 <nboldt>	(contrary to popular belief I do more than just meetings/minutes and creation of trello cards)
Jul 27 12:51:05 <mbenitez>	haha
Jul 27 12:51:06 <akurtakov>	well, as scls prepend
Jul 27 12:51:18 <akurtakov>	the scl name
Jul 27 12:51:52 <akurtakov>	it will be rh-eclipse46-smth
Jul 27 12:52:01 <nboldt>	ah
Jul 27 12:52:04 <akurtakov>	I see that mbooth went for https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/buildinfo?buildID=505275
Jul 27 12:52:09 <akurtakov>	aka rh-eclipse46-base
Jul 27 12:52:15 <mbenitez>	that smth could be root
Jul 27 12:52:24 <nboldt>	could be smdh too :D
Jul 27 12:52:40 <mbooth>	It can still change :-)
Jul 27 12:52:46 <mbenitez>	nboldt, this is the meta rpm for eclipse currently https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/buildinfo?buildID=505275
Jul 27 12:52:48 <nboldt>	because I do that a lot these days when I'm asking about base/common/commons/foundation/root/stem/underpinning/stuff-below
Jul 27 12:52:50 <akurtakov>	BUT we can add Provides: devstudio-common-common and etc.
Jul 27 12:53:13 <akurtakov>	so `yum install devstudio-eclipse-common` still works 
Jul 27 12:53:16 <mbooth>	Currently: "rh-eclipse46" -> installs everything in the SCL / "rh-eclipse46-base" -> installs only things shared by the SCL and DevStudio
Jul 27 12:53:26 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks for the patch review !
Jul 27 12:53:39 <mbenitez>	mbooth, nice
Jul 27 12:53:40 <xcoulon>	I marked the issue as resolved/fixed
Jul 27 12:54:00 <akurtakov>	nboldt: ah, so you're on to clarifying things 
Jul 27 12:54:06 *	akurtakov thought of user experience
Jul 27 12:54:20 <mbooth>	But if you prefer it to be called something other than "...-base" now is the time :-)
Jul 27 12:54:55 <nboldt>	yeah, that's why I'm bringing it up
Jul 27 12:55:08 <nboldt>	to avoid "which base do you mean?" questions
Jul 27 12:55:20 <mbenitez>	could it be something like IDE?
Jul 27 12:55:32 <akurtakov>	so we make it which ide :)
Jul 27 12:55:48 <akurtakov>	I tried to stick to shared(components) but it didn't work better
Jul 27 12:55:56 <akurtakov>	kind of lost hope to clarify this one
Jul 27 12:56:13 <mbenitez>	well, it's rh-eclipse-ide...
Jul 27 12:56:25 <mbenitez>	but base is fine with me
Jul 27 12:57:54 <mbooth>	akurtakov: It could be rh-eclipse46-shared-components, if you like your RPM names nice and descriptive ;-)
Jul 27 12:58:20 <akurtakov>	mbooth: well, I read the %description usually :)
Jul 27 12:58:34 <akurtakov>	it's not me that cares about this one :)
Jul 27 12:59:08 <mbenitez>	actually, if the default is to install only the common stuff that should be rh-eclipse46
Jul 27 12:59:39 <mbenitez>	then instead of a base we'd have an rh-eclipse-all or linux or such
Jul 27 12:59:46 <mbooth>	I mean, it's pretty academic, because the devstudio RPM would just have Requires: rh-eclipse46-whatever-we-call-it and users will never see it
Jul 27 13:01:22 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I dislike going against the established convention of what you get when you install the unadorned "rh-eclipse46" package (do we want to have different behaviour to other SCLs?)
Jul 27 13:02:31 <mbenitez>	mbooth, agreed on not going against convention, where will the devstudio rpm live?
Jul 27 13:02:41 <mbenitez>	rh-eclipse46-devstudio?
Jul 27 13:04:14 <mbooth>	Good question...
Jul 27 13:04:44 <mbenitez>	I think once we figure that we can get the names straight
Jul 27 13:05:03 <mbooth>	If it's not shipping as part of the SCL, it doesn't need to have the rh-eclipse46 prefix
Jul 27 13:05:20 <mbenitez>	if it is inside the collection [which I think makes sense] then the meta will install it too
Jul 27 13:05:59 <mbenitez>	if it's not inside the collection it would be another collection, in theory a separate channel...
Jul 27 13:07:15 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Can we ship binary-only rpms through a RHEL channel?
Jul 27 13:07:17 <mbenitez>	the idea is to ship an 'eclipse product' with potentially 2 customer bases: devstudio and c/c++
Jul 27 13:09:00 <mbenitez>	mbooth, I don't know, I'd think no, maybe worth us talking to nboldt about how they are delivering things
Jul 27 13:09:15 <mbenitez>	maybe we should schedule a call for that
Jul 27 13:09:55 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: I think we should go with the freedom to have yum repo separately for now
Jul 27 13:10:15 <akurtakov>	not puting it in any channel and etc.
Jul 27 13:10:22 <mbenitez>	ok
Jul 27 13:10:31 <akurtakov>	just generate the devstudio rpms and run createrepo
Jul 27 13:11:29 <akurtakov>	if/when someone clears the shipping not-build from source in channels
Jul 27 13:11:40 <akurtakov>	we can think of having channel for it
Jul 27 13:12:16 <akurtakov>	but for the initial release that would be an overkill as I would bet this question will not be cleared :)
Jul 27 13:23:25 <mbooth>	mbenitez: BTW, erratum is created: https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/24366
Jul 27 13:23:47 <mbooth>	Had to also make the bug "modified"
Jul 27 13:24:35 <mbooth>	Should be called "BureaucracyZilla"
Jul 27 13:25:47 <nboldt>	mbenitez: we deliver things via a release-engineering@redhat.com / RCM ticket. siege then copies the zips & jars from internal server to CSP stging server and download manager, gets approval from QE, and pushes things to production.
Jul 27 13:26:39 <nboldt>	I've no idea what the rules are for binary-only RPMs, but we ship binary-only installer & update sites, with either a sources zip beside it or a link back to github for fresh sources
Jul 27 13:32:13 <mbooth>	nboldt: A yum repo is not that different to a p2 repo -- your rpms could probably be the same way.
Jul 27 13:32:30 <mbooth>	s/probably be/probably be delivered/
Jul 27 13:32:55 <nboldt>	so we're currently thinking of rh-eclipse46-base, rh-eclipse46-c++, and rh-eclipse46-devstudio as the three rpms?
Jul 27 13:33:17 <nboldt>	mbooth: ^ ?
Jul 27 13:33:49 <nboldt>	or maybe the second one is called rh-eclipse46-linuxtools-and-profiling-and-cdt-and-so-on....
Jul 27 13:34:34 <mbooth>	nboldt: Or maybe "rh-eclipse46-dts" instead of "...c++" since you'd get the same tools as your used to from the old DTS product
Jul 27 13:35:00 <nboldt>	ah, ok
Jul 27 13:35:14 <nboldt>	mbooth: so we have a "base/commons/whatever" one and two named for products?
Jul 27 13:35:50 <nboldt>	rh-eclipse46-basic-common-shared-stuff, rh-eclipse46-dts, rh-eclipse46-devstudio ?
Jul 27 13:35:57 <mbooth>	Sounds reasonable
Jul 27 13:36:11 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Thoughts? ^
Jul 27 13:36:15 <nboldt>	but these are metapackages for stuff underneath, right?
Jul 27 13:36:22 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yes
Jul 27 13:36:39 <nboldt>	so rh-eclipse46-devstudio would actually install things like eclipse-webtools, eclipse-datatools, eclipse-gef, eclipse-mylyn, ...
Jul 27 13:37:00 <nboldt>	and possibly an rpm called devstudio-javaee-datatools-something-something
Jul 27 13:37:29 <akurtakov>	mbooth: what do you ask exactly?
Jul 27 13:38:00 <nboldt>	akurtakov: names of the three RHSCL metpackages: rh-eclipse46-basic-common-shared-stuff, rh-eclipse46-dts, rh-eclipse46-devstudio ?
Jul 27 13:38:10 <nboldt>	metapackages*
Jul 27 13:39:07 <akurtakov>	the third one rh-eclipse46-devstudio can be named just rhdevstudio as it woud not come from this metapackage as content for it will not be in that channel
Jul 27 13:40:00 <akurtakov>	so rh-eclipse46-dts will be additional Provides to rh-eclipse46 (as this one must install the whole scl as per convention)
Jul 27 13:40:52 <akurtakov>	actually eclipse is separate scl now
Jul 27 13:40:59 <nboldt>	akurtakov: so you'd call the three packages rh-eclipse46, rh-eclipse46-dts, and rhdevstudio ?
Jul 27 13:41:12 <akurtakov>	so we should not mention scl 
Jul 27 13:41:15 <akurtakov>	er dts
Jul 27 13:41:26 <nboldt>	because product no longer exists?
Jul 27 13:41:37 <nboldt>	*will no longer* exist?
Jul 27 13:41:42 <akurtakov>	no, because eclipse is split from it
Jul 27 13:41:58 <akurtakov>	and dts becomes toolchain (gcc, gdb...) only
Jul 27 13:43:01 <akurtakov>	so rh-eclipse46 is the current dts eclipse (Provides can be added for yum install "coolname" to work
Jul 27 13:43:31 <nboldt>	ok, can we at least decide what the devstudio "C" package will be called?
Jul 27 13:43:42 <akurtakov>	the only thing in question is what to append after rh-eclipse46- for the shared one
Jul 27 13:43:45 <nboldt>	devstudio-javaee (because it's mostly for javaee work) ?
Jul 27 13:43:54 <akurtakov>	I like rhdevstudio
Jul 27 13:44:01 <nboldt>	or rh-eclipse46-devstudio ?
Jul 27 13:44:11 <nboldt>	rhdevstudio is probably forbidden by Brand
Jul 27 13:44:19 <akurtakov>	meh :)
Jul 27 13:44:54 <nboldt>	having been on the receiving end of Brand/UX screwing me over not once but twice in the last GA release, I can assure you that we need to do things according to the Book Of Brand
Jul 27 13:45:11 <akurtakov>	so let it be rh-eclipse46-devstudio :)
Jul 27 13:45:13 <nboldt>	failure to adhere to their rules will result in 11th hour panic & extra work
Jul 27 13:45:16 <nboldt>	ok
Jul 27 13:45:46 <nboldt>	so in this context "devstudio" is all the stuff that makes the current devstudio be devstudio, EXCEPT its upstream eclipse-* dependencies
Jul 27 13:45:53 <akurtakov>	I would rather see UX people starting eclipse and working on simplifying real UX 
Jul 27 13:46:04 <akurtakov>	nboldt: yes
Jul 27 13:46:05 <nboldt>	thus jbosstools, com.jboss.devstudio.* features, and some eclipse stuff that's not avaialble in rpms
Jul 27 13:47:00 <akurtakov>	UX should deal with real UX like https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/ not with package names
Jul 27 13:49:28 <akurtakov>	e.g. smth like https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Boxes for the docker plugins 
Jul 27 13:49:52 <akurtakov>	but I can only dream on focusing on real, user facing stuff
Jul 27 13:51:52 <nboldt>	mbenitez: if it would help, I can add people to the eclipse-list@ list for you. but you'll have to make me an admin and fwd me a list of email addresses
Jul 27 13:56:59 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thanks for the offer!
Jul 27 13:57:07 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_: have I captured all the testing cases you want here? https://trello.com/c/nW3ajKJa/7-wrap-new-devstudio-javaee-update-site-inside-an-rpm-for-linux-installs
Jul 27 13:57:28 <nboldt>	if you want to split that into another card so you can track QE stuff separately, feel free
Jul 27 13:58:05 <nboldt>	(much of the discussion at the G2 sprint plan was "is a card done if the doc's not done? what if the work's done, the doc's done, but the doc's not QE'd?"
Jul 27 13:58:24 <nboldt>	... to which I would say "you need a second card for the doc team's work")
Jul 27 13:58:33 <mbenitez>	mbooth, I like the new name "BureaucracyZilla" :D thanks for creating the errata
Jul 27 13:58:59 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, looking
Jul 27 14:28:12 <akazakov>	nboldt, why do you call it devstudio-javaee ?
Jul 27 14:28:26 <akazakov>	it's not only javee stuff, right?
Jul 27 14:29:13 <nboldt>	got a better name, akazakov ?
Jul 27 14:29:21 <nboldt>	devstudio-devstudio seems daft
Jul 27 14:29:31 <nboldt>	and devstudio-common isn't true
Jul 27 14:29:45 <akazakov>	javaee is not true either..
Jul 27 14:29:53 <nboldt>	we already use "devstudio core" to differentiate from integration stack, so it's a subset of core
Jul 27 14:30:01 <nboldt>	devstudio-subcore?
Jul 27 14:30:42 <akazakov>	this name is for update site only, correct?
Jul 27 14:31:10 <nboldt>	yes
Jul 27 14:31:26 <nboldt>	to differentiate it from the core, central, earlyaccess, targetplatform-*, etc.
Jul 27 14:36:37 <akazakov>	nboldt, I don't know.. maybe devstudio-tools.. I'm bad with names...

Jul 28 11:30:58 <ericwill>	akurtakov good news: ipun and I are working on a patch with the GTK guys for the font business
Jul 28 11:31:10 <ericwill>	early testing shows that it fixes the bug

Aug 01 12:53:05 <akurtakov>	mbooth: sorry, I'm still doing proof reading :)
Aug 01 12:53:15 <mbooth>	akurtakov: What do you think it should say now it's not part of DTS?
Aug 01 12:53:23 <mbooth>	Just "Eclipse Neon" maybe?
Aug 01 12:53:39 <akurtakov>	Red Hat Eclipse?

Aug 02 11:34:38 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: jjohnstn: hello ! would you be available tomorrow for a quick weekly call ? We now have our own dashboard on JIRA for the sprint planning (https://issues.jboss.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=3636&view=planning), so we could discuss about it and see what we plan to do for the current sprint. 
Aug 02 11:43:21 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: i'm available.. not sure if jeff is back.
Aug 02 11:43:53 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: oh, I thought he was back yesterday. Or is it on Thursday ? 
Aug 02 11:44:34 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: i don't see him as being on pto..so i'm guessing should be today.
Aug 02 11:44:53 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: ^
Aug 02 11:51:28 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: tomorrow is fine...what time?
Aug 02 11:52:08 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: rgrunber: same as usual ? 9am for you / 3pm for you ?
Aug 02 11:59:12 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: jjohnstn: I just sent the invitations for tomorrow. Please let me know if this works for you
Aug 02 11:59:45 <xcoulon>	or if you want it a bit later (but not too much, I also have family constraints at 5pm CET)
Aug 02 12:31:05 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: it is fine..can you look at: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22274 and tell me why I keep getting messages saying: "This email is the result of a query to locate stalled/invalid jiras. Please fix them. Thanks!"
Aug 02 12:40:56 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: we have a daily job that queries the JIRA issues and find erroneous issues. You should have more info about what's wrong in the mail body, but at first sight, I would say that's because the issue is set to be fixed in 4.4.1.AM1 which is past and the issue is still opened. So you should probably set a new fix version.
Aug 02 12:42:35 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: thx, I changed to 4.4.1.AM2 so hopefully that is ok
Aug 02 12:42:46 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: yes, I guess it will be fine

Aug 03 06:47:16 <akurtakov>	mbooth: scela: what comes from mylyn incubation?
Aug 03 06:47:40 <scela>	akurtakov: i don't think the trick was done in incubation
Aug 03 06:47:46 <scela>	rather in the main repo
Aug 03 06:48:38 <akurtakov>	I was thinking as incubation usually creates some issues
Aug 03 06:48:49 <akurtakov>	we may decide dropping it from mylyn package
Aug 03 06:49:02 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Some Trac plugin and some "Web Tasks" plugin
Aug 03 06:49:07 <akurtakov>	and what comes from it could be separate one if at all needed 
Aug 03 06:49:36 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Basically scela was foiled by some "creative release engineering"

Aug 03 09:13:17 *	rgrunber looks
Aug 03 09:14:15 <rgrunber>	ah indirectly referenced.. hmm seems like that would be a 'plugin' bug.. ie.. needs an import package on it.. or at least to add to that .java file.
Aug 03 09:14:43 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to mattn
Aug 03 09:17:26 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Interesting, I wonder why it did work previously
Aug 03 09:17:50 <rgrunber>	.. could it be a change in swtbot ?
Aug 03 09:18:30 <rgrunber>	i mean indirectly referenced happens for things like doing foo().bar() where bar() returns a class you don't import or whatnot..
Aug 03 09:18:39 <rgrunber>	from what i remember..
Aug 03 09:20:25 <mbooth>	I mean, why did it work before applying that patch? Nothing else should have changed
Aug 03 09:20:49 <mbooth>	Those locally installed bundles messing it up?
Aug 03 09:21:42 <rgrunber>	hmmm
Aug 03 09:22:11 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Hi, we are talking about https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1362178
Aug 03 09:22:32 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: I wonder if the problem goes away if you clear your ~/.eclipse again
Aug 03 09:23:30 <rgrunber>	the other thing is i may need to properly fix things.. ie..the fix vkadlcik has now isn't complete..
Aug 03 09:24:34 <rgrunber>	also is the org.eclipse.swt in the plugins folder identical to the one on the system... i would try to confirm.. if he used a very new swtbot it might have fetched a newer swt...
Aug 03 09:30:11 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, hi Roland, if you're joining the call now I'm in Yonge if you want to join
Aug 03 09:30:37 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: sure, i'll head over there.. just finishing up current docker call
Aug 03 09:31:26 <mbenitez>	sure, no worries
Aug 03 09:33:45 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: i'm very sorry but i'm in network problems now and my irc is practically unusable
Aug 03 09:33:49 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: the problem persists even with deleted ~/.eclipse

Aug 03 10:25:59 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik_gone: i can have a look.. assuming mbooth isn't on the machine testing.
Aug 03 10:26:16 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Not yet :-)

Aug 03 11:42:28 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i was just gonna ask about that :P
Aug 03 11:42:42 <mbooth>	Ask what?
Aug 03 11:42:52 <rgrunber>	mbooth: accessing the rh-eclipse stuff.
Aug 03 11:42:57 <mbooth>	Aha
Aug 03 11:43:09 <mbooth>	Then that was just for you ;-)
Aug 03 11:43:19 <rgrunber>	also if you're away and i may need to push changes from fedora eclipse into that rh-eclipse..

Aug 03 11:45:02 <rgrunber>	ah, awesome
Aug 03 11:53:12 <mbenitez>	thanks for the email mbooth 
Aug 03 11:55:00 <mbooth>	mbenitez: No worries, I expected backlash due to sending HTML email ;-)
Aug 03 11:55:20 <mbenitez>	haha
Aug 03 11:55:53 <mbooth>	Oh cripes I sent it to the wrong list -- sorry
Aug 03 11:57:56 <mbenitez>	no worries, this is new
Aug 03 11:58:34 <rgrunber>	mbooth: one question about the bug in rh-eclipse. when vkadlcik_gone outlined the steps to reproduce, those are things that worked on dts-4.. and not thing that worked on rh-eclipse prior to my patch.. right ?
Aug 03 11:59:46 <rgrunber>	ah .. umm nvm.. yeah it would imply the patch failed..
Aug 03 12:00:06 <rgrunber>	since for 3 to fail all of 1-2 had to work..
Aug 03 12:04:22 <mbooth>	Yeah, everything except installation worked on rh-eclipse prior to the patch
Aug 03 12:05:57 <rgrunber>	mbooth: what i'm seeing is that no platform bundle is detected by the target platform which seems unrelated.. i'll debug it to see.
Aug 03 12:06:07 <rgrunber>	which would explain why it isn't being found.
Aug 03 12:13:16 <mbenitez>	ldimaggi, thank you for all the updates Len!
Aug 03 12:13:45 <ldimaggi>	mbenitez, just trying to tie up the many loose ends!   ;-)

Aug 03 13:29:18 <rgrunber>	mbooth: problem in the bug seems to be solved by the patch i'll end up applying to fix the 'p2.runnable' problem.
Aug 03 13:29:50 <mbooth>	That's good, right?
Aug 03 13:30:12 <rgrunber>	yup.. so first patch caused issues likely because it wasn't completed.. and p2.runnable is needed.
Aug 03 13:30:55 <rgrunber>	in fact what occured is bundles.info never got generated in the user's $HOME/.eclipse.. so of course target platform generation failed... because it was looking for the bundles.info there.
Aug 03 13:31:08 <rgrunber>	it found the droplets just fine.. but not any of the platform files.

Aug 03 15:52:07 <ericwill>	mbooth haha, I can imagine :)
Aug 03 15:52:50 <ericwill>	as a side note, I'm really impressed by the number of old bugs that have snippet reproducers attached
Aug 03 15:52:53 <ericwill>	really makes life easier
Aug 03 15:59:23 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Would you quickly try something for me?
Aug 03 15:59:30 <rgrunber>	mbooth: sure
Aug 03 16:00:02 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I just sent you a script and a spec file...
Aug 03 16:00:45 <rgrunber>	i'm guessing you want me to build it..
Aug 03 16:01:01 <mbooth>	(Based on your original script) Running this script should result in a binary RPM that installs some droplets generated from p2 repos
Aug 03 16:01:32 <mbooth>	Yes please, also please take a look to see if its sane
Aug 03 16:02:08 <mbooth>	Actually a yum repo, not just a binary rpm
Aug 03 16:02:11 <rgrunber>	ahh.. one thing i probably also missed from the repo2runnable script, the option '-flagAsRunnable'
Aug 03 16:04:18 <rgrunber>	so basically you assume some source folder exists called %{?scl_prefix}devstudio.tar.gz or whatnot.. you extract its contents.. then you call feature/bundle publisher to create the p2 repo from it.. i mean the paths would need to match up.. between the location of those bundles and 'file:$(pwd)/p2-repo'..
Aug 03 16:05:18 <mbooth>	The build.sh generates the tarball and the srpm, so paths should always br correct
Aug 03 16:05:25 <rgrunber>	ah.. d'oh
Aug 03 16:06:27 <rgrunber>	ah.. build.sh is the thing being executed
Aug 03 16:06:42 <mbooth>	Yes, that wasn't clear, sorry
Aug 03 16:08:24 <mbooth>	Assumptions made: Machine you are running this on can run mock (Fedora, probably) and you are inside the firewall (so you can build RHEL7 chroot)
Aug 03 16:08:57 <mbooth>	My thinking is that using mock should give pretty reproducible results outside of brew
Aug 03 16:11:41 <rgrunber>	k seems to be working.. downloaded stuff.. wrote the srpm..
Aug 03 16:12:10 <rgrunber>	doing the mock build now...
Aug 03 16:15:06 <rgrunber>	mbooth: there's one improvement that could be made from that 'p2_feature_curl' thing i wrote.. and that's to actually call the director to install the units. it would require the user list all repositories (like http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon) but we could do some logic afterwards like.. is this bundle from the p2 repo we care about or one of the others.. and decide whether to add it to the 
Aug 03 16:15:12 <rgrunber>	droplet on that criteria.
Aug 03 16:15:39 <rgrunber>	^ that would give us things like docker-client, jersey, ... in the case of linuxtools.docker.. instead of forcing there to be some feature that lists everything.
Aug 03 16:19:24 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yeah i guess for reproducibility you'd need to run it inside mock.. is it worth supplying an option in the future for the user to point to their own eclipse install.. i mean it'd be much faster should they choose that..
Aug 03 16:20:11 <mbooth>	Well, second run is faster since the mock root is cached
Aug 03 16:21:47 <mbooth>	And it's kind of just going be hooked into their existing deploy process -- I don't see people wanting to invoke this manually that much
Aug 03 16:23:21 <mbooth>	I see what you mean about improving 'p2_feature_curl' though
Aug 03 16:25:50 <rgrunber>	yeah we need p2's dep resolution greatness.. but then we want to remove all jars that came from somewhere else... or ... i think if we somehow use the system eclipse's profile.. it should.. not bring in the whole platform..
Aug 03 16:25:56 <rgrunber>	something to test though...
Aug 03 16:29:38 <rgrunber>	yay building the rpm..
Aug 03 16:31:30 <rgrunber>	mbooth: works for me.. built the yum repo contents seem right.
Aug 03 16:32:53 <mbooth>	Good :-)
Aug 03 16:34:07 <mbooth>	Building a second time should be super quick (the whole of maven is in the build root, a bit unnecessarily for this)
Aug 03 16:34:16 <rgrunber>	ah you even got rid of the feature.jars
Aug 03 16:34:43 <rgrunber>	ah nvm.. expanded on it to do features..
Aug 03 16:37:20 <rgrunber>	yeah this is awesome, nicely done.

Aug 04 07:08:38 <scela>	vkadlcik: np
Aug 04 07:25:27 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: No, that is not intentional :-( I guess file lists need refreshing in errata or something otherwise the SCL might not be installable from the compose :-(

Aug 05 10:24:18 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: ping.. ?
Aug 05 10:24:32 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: pong
Aug 05 10:24:50 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: is there access to the machine on which the slowness is happening ?
Aug 05 10:28:21 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: i'll prepare it, give me 15 min
Aug 05 10:28:50 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: i'm trying it out on 10.16.186.62 but wasn't able to reproduce huge delay yet..
Aug 05 10:34:21 <rgrunber>	ok nvm.. i've reproduced something that takes long. might be a similar cause.
Aug 05 10:41:39 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: so just in case: vncviewer ibm-ls22-04.rhts.eng.brq.redhat.com:1, password is redhat
Aug 05 10:41:58 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: it's starting -application org.eclipse.swtbot.eclipse.junit.headless.swtbottestapplication
Aug 05 10:42:34 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: now in about 3 min from my command
Aug 05 10:42:47 <rgrunber>	yup i see..
Aug 05 10:43:05 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: i won't be using the machine today
Aug 05 10:43:27 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: all the passwords should be redhat
Aug 05 10:47:01 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: can you try instead of calling 'eclipse' for the time being, to replace it with 'java -jar /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/lib*/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launch_*.jar .. that seemed to make a huge difference when i was trying it out..
Aug 05 10:47:35 <rgrunber>	also it seems only the first run is insanely slow, definitely droplets related though.
Aug 05 10:50:04 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: i used to do it that way but one it needs more parameters and they seem to differ between versions so i ended up with simple 'eclipse'
Aug 05 10:50:26 <vkadlcik>	s/ one//
Aug 05 10:52:20 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: yeah can be a bit trick to always try to find the equinox launcher.. just a workaround until i figure a solution for the issue.
Aug 05 10:56:56 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: finding the launcher isn't tricky, the problem was to add all the additional switches in a way that would work across all supported eclipse versions
Aug 05 10:57:17 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: but i can do it, in the worst case :-)
Aug 05 10:57:22 <rgrunber>	ah wait for tests there's additional paramaters other than just what you specified.. ?
Aug 05 11:01:34 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: hmm, nope, please stick with what's in bugzilla; what i do normally is out of scope
Aug 05 11:01:45 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: sorry for the confusion

Aug 08 05:43:11 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: hi Mat, will you please check/reload the builds in the rh-eclipse46 erratum?
Aug 08 05:43:22 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: what brewroot has but not in the erratum: -build, -eclipse-egit-mylyn, -eclipse-emf-examples, -eclipse-emf-sdk, -eclipse-emf-tests
Aug 08 05:43:37 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Hi, sure -- let me take a look now
Aug 08 05:44:44 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to palves
Aug 08 05:59:37 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Okay done, hopefully that should be better
Aug 08 06:09:16 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: thanks, just checked - still rh-eclipse46-build is missing
Aug 08 06:09:29 <mbooth>	D'oh
Aug 08 06:19:29 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: I don't know how to fix this one -- even removing and re-adding the build did not work :-(
Aug 08 06:19:35 <mbooth>	Let me ask rzima
Aug 08 06:20:54 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: ack

Aug 08 09:49:26 <mbooth>	Morning, mbenitez 
Aug 08 09:49:44 <mbenitez>	mbooth, hello Mat, how was your long weekend?
Aug 08 09:50:01 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Nice and sunny, thanks :-)
Aug 08 09:50:12 <mbenitez>	excellent :)
Aug 08 09:51:02 <mbooth>	mbenitez: You should know that there was a slight problem reported with the alpha hand-off that needs PM clarification: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1365100
Aug 08 09:51:24 *	mbenitez looks
Aug 08 09:53:28 <mbenitez>	mbooth, interesting, I didn't know rhscl doesn't provide this build feature
Aug 08 09:54:27 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Me neither, this caught us by surprise
Aug 08 09:54:48 <mbenitez>	mbooth, I just asked briang in #devtoolset, thanks fro bringing this up
Aug 08 10:36:47 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: woohoo ! it took me a bit of time, but I've just managed to parse the Docker Compose output, read the ANSI escape codes and print in the MessageConsole with proper text coloring: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4v1y94fpgzayxx0/Screenshot%202016-08-08%2016.29.25.png?dl=0
Aug 08 10:37:19 <xcoulon>	there's still work to do, though
Aug 08 10:40:21 <rgrunber>	looks good to me. we can probably use that same work to support container logs that have escape codes.. without moving them to tm terminal.
Aug 08 10:45:09 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, that was my thought too. I suggest we discuss about it in an upcoming change, ok ?
Aug 08 10:46:39 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to mbenitez
Aug 08 10:46:55 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: sure. btw is this something you've written from scratch ? or based on existing stuff from projects that have done the same.
Aug 08 10:47:18 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: nope, I wrote it from scratch
Aug 08 10:47:47 <rgrunber>	i might look at other projects that have done it to ensure we support all possible codes.
Aug 08 10:49:24 <rgrunber>	i mean specifically for things like colours, or really uncommon codes.
