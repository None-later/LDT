Jul 26 05:53:13 <PiyushB>	akurtakov, around ?
Jul 26 06:13:55 <PiyushB>	trying to get this eclipse 3.2 running, not sure where issue is... http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/395942
Jul 26 06:20:13 <mbooth>	"[root@ESMAD7IV04 ~]# eclipse"
Jul 26 06:20:35 <mbooth>	PiyushB: Did you mean to run Eclipse as root?
Jul 26 06:20:47 <mbooth>	It's generally not a good idea
Jul 26 06:20:57 <PiyushB>	mbooth, yes its root
Jul 26 06:21:34 <akurtakov>	PiyushB: that's not supported 
Jul 26 06:21:45 <akurtakov>	in later versions we added code to actually prevent it
Jul 26 06:21:50 <akurtakov>	mbooth: good catch
Jul 26 06:22:12 <akurtakov>	PiyushB: once you run it as root it will screw its metadata (on ancient versions)

Jul 26 06:23:04 <akurtakov>	PiyushB: running as root once it will screw for non-root too
Jul 26 06:23:26 <akurtakov>	please uninstall eclipse, make sure there is nothing left in libdir/eclipse
Jul 26 06:23:28 <mbooth>	PiyushB: There's a good chance you will need to re-install it since the master p2 profile might be screwed
Jul 26 06:23:36 <akurtakov>	install again and try again as non root

Jul 26 12:26:35 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff ! I'm running the maven build on master branch for the Docker tooling (after pulling the latest changes) and I have 3 or 4 errors (depending on the build). Do you have the same results locally ? 
Jul 26 12:26:42 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: welcome back :)
Jul 26 12:26:55 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks !
Jul 26 12:27:33 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: sorry, I did not see you online when writing the message to Jeff. I guess I read too fast the list of online pple
Jul 26 12:27:45 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: yes, welcome...I haven't seen any build errors in hudson
Jul 26 12:28:04 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok.. damn'it.. 
Jul 26 12:28:15 <rgrunber>	what kind of error (test, building, ..)
Jul 26 12:28:29 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: rgrunber: test failures, actually
Jul 26 12:28:37 <xcoulon>	Tests in error:
Jul 26 12:28:37 <xcoulon>	  BuildDockerImageShortcutSWTBotTest.shouldDisableCommandOnFirstCallWhenMissingConnection:99 » WidgetNotFound
Jul 26 12:28:37 <xcoulon>	  EditDockerConnectionSWTBotTest.shouldUpdateLaunchConfigurationWhenConnectionNameChanged:349->configureRunImageLaunchConfiguration:146 » ClassCast
Jul 26 12:28:37 <xcoulon>	  ImageRunSWTBotTest.shouldReportErrorIfContainerWithSameNameExists:97 » Timeout
Jul 26 12:29:10 <xcoulon>	but I see that there's a new dialog saying that there's no connection, asking to create a new one, and I suspect it might cause some issue with SWTBot
Jul 26 12:29:23 <xcoulon>	issue or side effect, to be more accurate
Jul 26 12:29:56 <jjohnstn>	yes, that would make sense
Jul 26 12:30:51 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok, so before pushing a new version of my work for issue 496922 (I changed my code after your review), I'll probably submit a fix for the test failures. ok for you ?
Jul 26 12:31:12 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: yes, that's fine
Jul 26 12:31:44 <rgrunber>	there's a new dialog for build launch shortcut that links to new connection wizard if no connections exist at all.
Jul 26 12:31:49 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: rgrunber: do you remember which issue/patch brought this dialog ? 
Jul 26 12:32:25 <rgrunber>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/77638/
Jul 26 12:32:59 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: Meeting tomorrow will be 30min earlier
Jul 26 12:34:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks !
Jul 26 12:38:23 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: jjohnstn: may I ask.. should the shell be labelled "No Docker connection exists" (singular) or "No Docker connections exist" (plural) ? 
Jul 26 12:38:59 <xcoulon>	because we have both singular and plural messages and I wonder if both are valid in English ;-)
Jul 26 12:40:21 <rgrunber>	both seem right to me.. i guess i went with "no docker connections exist" though..
Jul 26 12:40:51 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: ok, thanks for clarifying. I'll probably rename the other label to be consistent with your, then
Jul 26 12:40:53 <rgrunber>	technically i think "no docker connecion exists" is better since the requirement is that at least one be present..
Jul 26 12:41:02 <xcoulon>	ha ok
Jul 26 12:41:09 <xcoulon>	so I'll edit it, then

Jul 26 12:43:52 <akurtakov>	doing that in the swt.binaries repo will rebuild the natives and put them in the proper places

Jul 26 13:38:50 <mbenitez>	nboldt, hi Nick! thanks for being so involved in the conversations :)
Jul 26 13:39:35 <mbenitez>	nboldt, re: the rpm work, we'll have a planning mtg tomorrow to get some more details into what we expect to achieve when, let's go from there
Jul 26 13:42:28 <nboldt>	mbenitez: excellent, thanks
Jul 26 13:42:46 <mbenitez>	np!
Jul 26 13:42:58 <nboldt>	btw, I use pidgin so if you ever see I'm not on IRC it could be because pidgin has silently crashed (often when VPN goes down)
Jul 26 13:43:14 <nboldt>	in that case, there's email/hipchat as backup :D
Jul 26 13:43:16 <mbenitez>	tomorrow we can find a victim ^W volunteer to help you :)
Jul 26 13:43:44 <nboldt>	I thought the victim was Matt Booth, as thrown into the volcano by akurtakov
Jul 26 13:44:03 <nboldt>	mbooth: ^
Jul 26 13:44:18 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thanks for letting me know, I believe in letting people be offline so if there was something that needed your attention I'll send a note for sure
Jul 26 13:44:31 <mbooth>	:-)
Jul 26 13:44:52 <akurtakov>	my bad, I miscalculated that rhscl alpha deadline is friday
Jul 26 13:44:53 <mbenitez>	nboldt, yes, Mat will help you, he's just been super busy preparing the dts/rhscl hand off for this Friday
Jul 26 13:45:14 <nboldt>	mbenitez: cool. could also be that I'm on another screen and not seeing the chihuahua-like blinking pidgin cursor notifying me of @mentions
Jul 26 13:45:31 <mbenitez>	haha
Jul 26 13:45:35 <akurtakov>	nboldt: I'll let other things aside and try to have simple spec file for usage tomorrow
Jul 26 13:45:53 <nboldt>	hey, no worries. we still have 6 weeks before devstudio has to be done for the next GA release ... two more sprints to go
Jul 26 13:46:05 <mbenitez>	nboldt, if you have specific questions at any point don't hesitate to just throw them here, anyone who's done pkg work will help
Jul 26 13:46:48 <akurtakov>	hmm, rgrunber is too calm when we speak for howto generate droplets :)
Jul 26 13:46:59 <nboldt>	I guess I need to get a vm with Fedora24 on it (currently do most work on F20) so I can actually use the rpm? what's your toolset for working with rpms and specfiles? (I think I've used the Eclipse specfile editor once.)
Jul 26 13:48:15 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: if that was calm.. imagine how i feel now that i'm discovering all these minor bugs.
Jul 26 13:49:03 <akurtakov>	nboldt: f24 is a prereq yes
Jul 26 13:50:07 <nboldt>	damn. OK. I'll go find an .iso and more disk space
Jul 26 13:50:10 <rgrunber>	mbooth: btw do you remember when we had a discussion with jeff about cdt not symlinking some thing (maybe lpg-java).. and we both agreed on something.. then never spoke of it again.
Jul 26 13:50:37 <nboldt>	...and some free time to set it up... and to migrate my ~/ folder to it... *sigh*
Jul 26 13:51:46 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Erm... now you're really quizzing me...
Jul 26 13:52:06 *	mbooth tries to remember what he had for breakfast...
Jul 26 13:52:22 <rgrunber>	mbooth: that convo is the reason i now set autolog on
Jul 26 13:52:42 <mbenitez>	nboldt, fun times :) if you need anything [other than time] let me know
Jul 26 13:52:54 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I'm sure there's a million entries if I grep my logs for "symlink" :-(
Jul 26 13:53:43 <rgrunber>	hmm maybe cdt.. jjohnstn , long story short cdt-parsers stuff is not started because symlink to lpg-java isn't in any of the cdt plugins/ folders
Jul 26 13:54:02 <rgrunber>	yet the 'requires' exist in the rpm metadata..
Jul 26 13:54:42 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Hmm, actually I remember a conversation about freemarker...
Jul 26 13:54:52 <mbooth>	Or was that something different
Jul 26 13:55:14 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i fixed freemarker according to the commits..
Jul 26 13:55:20 <rgrunber>	for arduino
Jul 26 13:56:21 <rgrunber>	umm nvm can't find it but i fixed some symlinks..
Jul 26 13:58:27 <rgrunber>	anyways it looks like i'd have to debug fedoraproject-p2 or at least rebuild with -X to figure out why symlink is not generated.. so just wanted to see if anyone remembered the convo before i go down that rabbit hole.
Jul 26 14:07:21 <mbenitez>	akazakov, hi Alexey, I updated the calendar invite for tomorrow, I added those who've been in the conversation so far, let me know if I missed anybody or just go ahead and add them
Jul 26 14:07:49 <akazakov>	mbenitez, thanks!
Jul 26 14:07:59 <akazakov>	I also added Jeff.
Jul 26 14:08:18 <mbenitez>	sounds good :)
Jul 26 14:10:09 <mbenitez>	akazakov, re: mailing list I can subscribe people [I think] could you please just email me the names?
Jul 26 14:10:35 <akazakov>	mbenitez, sure
Jul 26 14:17:16 <akazakov>	mbenitez, sent the list

Jul 26 15:54:23 <nboldt>	hey, dumb question... any recommendations for a better IRC client that works on both fedora and windows10?
Jul 26 15:54:39 <ericwill>	nboldt I think Hexchat is Linux and Windows
Jul 26 15:58:29 <nboldt>	ericwill: but is it good? can it hold channels open persistently even if i minimize them? @notifications? logging? 
Jul 26 16:00:31 <nboldt>	ah, I see that's a yes for autoconnect & join on startup
Jul 26 16:01:01 <ericwill>	nboldt yup, should do all of that
Jul 26 16:01:27 <ericwill>	minimizes to the tray and will show a balloon notification when you get pinged
Jul 26 16:02:12 <rgrunber>	is that fancy windows bash thing good enough to run irssi ? :P
Jul 26 16:02:47 <nboldt>	maaybe
Jul 26 16:02:57 <nboldt>	otherwise there's cygwin, mingw, git bash, ...
Jul 26 16:03:34 <nboldt>	and that embedded linux bash thing *cough* ubuntu */cough*
Jul 26 16:05:05 <lufimtse>	nboldt, I haven't tried Hexchat on Windows, but works well on linux OS.g_object_get (settings, WebKitGTK.geometry, geometry, 0);
Jul 26 16:05:12 <lufimtse>	^ https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html
Jul 26 16:05:18 <lufimtse>	wrong clipboard content lol.
Jul 26 16:05:29 <nboldt>	lol, thannks

Jul 27 09:26:46 <mbenitez>	xcoulon, hi, Jeff is on pto until next Tuesday
Jul 27 09:27:21 <xcoulon>	mbenitez: ha ok… I saw him online and I did not know he was on PTO
Jul 27 09:27:36 <xcoulon>	mbenitez: thanks
Jul 27 09:27:52 <mbenitez>	xcoulon, yes :) that is very confusing, Roland should be in soon, maybe he can help you

Jul 27 09:59:20 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: hello Roland. Would you mind giving a look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77972/ ? 
Jul 27 09:59:53 <xcoulon>	also, I sent a couple of mails this morning but we should discuss about them when Jeff comes back from PTO. Ok for you ?
Jul 27 10:01:56 <rgrunber>	was just about to send email, basically http://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs_2#Evolving_API_interfaces_-_API_methods
Jul 27 10:05:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks for the link. But from my understanding, adding a method in IDockerConnectionSettingsFinder breaks the compatibility, right ?
Jul 27 10:08:40 <rgrunber>	exception is if it doesn't need to be implemented by clients then it's only breaking source compatibility or contract compatibility.
Jul 27 10:09:17 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: how does this method addition changes from what I proposed in my patches ?
Jul 27 10:09:25 <rgrunber>	i could just make it internal and not expose it at all.
Jul 27 10:09:31 <xcoulon>	s/changes/change/
Jul 27 10:10:12 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: what I'm trying to understand is if this is a valid addition or not, since all my proposals were rejected.
Jul 27 10:11:50 <rgrunber>	we'll find some way around getting the change in... worst case we just have to not expose any new methods through the interface.
Jul 27 10:12:44 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: "we'll find some way around getting the change in... " <- ok, fine. Then we can do the same on IDockerConnection and IDockerImage, ok ?
Jul 27 10:13:55 <rgrunber>	we can do the same thing.. just not add them to the public api for 5.1
Jul 27 10:14:10 <xcoulon>	ok

Jul 27 12:42:21 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I think you'll want to skip all the changes in the SWTBot tests, it's really a matter of dealing with all the new connection created by the new extension points that you added
Jul 27 12:48:39 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_mtg4: mbenitez: akazakov akurtakov: would a better name for the "A" RPM be devstudio-root? 
Jul 27 12:48:57 <nboldt>	or devstudio-stem?
Jul 27 12:49:08 <akurtakov>	what's "A"
Jul 27 12:49:13 <akurtakov>	the shared one ?
Jul 27 12:49:17 <nboldt>	yes
Jul 27 12:49:25 <nboldt>	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EguQBtlIOXCz5CGCoAO3MEWDnNXITv0st6dhIk8Cwac/edit# scroll to near the bottom
Jul 27 12:49:47 <mbenitez>	I like the root idea but shouldn't it be eclipse? since it's platform
Jul 27 12:50:00 <mbenitez>	+ other common components
Jul 27 12:50:05 <nboldt>	right... 
Jul 27 12:50:08 <akurtakov>	that's implementation detail, which comes from the scl metapackage
Jul 27 12:50:11 <nboldt>	so devstudio-eclipse-common ?
Jul 27 12:50:35 <nboldt>	akurtakov: I know it's an implementation detail, I'm just wondering what the best name for it would be 
Jul 27 12:50:44 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, agreed that it's implementation detail, I think nboldt just wants to clarify
Jul 27 12:50:54 <mbenitez>	and it would help so we all know what we're talking about
Jul 27 12:50:59 <nboldt>	(contrary to popular belief I do more than just meetings/minutes and creation of trello cards)
Jul 27 12:51:05 <mbenitez>	haha
Jul 27 12:51:06 <akurtakov>	well, as scls prepend
Jul 27 12:51:18 <akurtakov>	the scl name
Jul 27 12:51:52 <akurtakov>	it will be rh-eclipse46-smth
Jul 27 12:52:01 <nboldt>	ah
Jul 27 12:52:04 <akurtakov>	I see that mbooth went for https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/buildinfo?buildID=505275
Jul 27 12:52:09 <akurtakov>	aka rh-eclipse46-base
Jul 27 12:52:15 <mbenitez>	that smth could be root
Jul 27 12:52:24 <nboldt>	could be smdh too :D
Jul 27 12:52:40 <mbooth>	It can still change :-)
Jul 27 12:52:46 <mbenitez>	nboldt, this is the meta rpm for eclipse currently https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/buildinfo?buildID=505275
Jul 27 12:52:48 <nboldt>	because I do that a lot these days when I'm asking about base/common/commons/foundation/root/stem/underpinning/stuff-below
Jul 27 12:52:50 <akurtakov>	BUT we can add Provides: devstudio-common-common and etc.
Jul 27 12:53:13 <akurtakov>	so `yum install devstudio-eclipse-common` still works 
Jul 27 12:53:16 <mbooth>	Currently: "rh-eclipse46" -> installs everything in the SCL / "rh-eclipse46-base" -> installs only things shared by the SCL and DevStudio
Jul 27 12:53:26 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks for the patch review !
Jul 27 12:53:39 <mbenitez>	mbooth, nice
Jul 27 12:53:40 <xcoulon>	I marked the issue as resolved/fixed
Jul 27 12:54:00 <akurtakov>	nboldt: ah, so you're on to clarifying things 
Jul 27 12:54:06 *	akurtakov thought of user experience
Jul 27 12:54:20 <mbooth>	But if you prefer it to be called something other than "...-base" now is the time :-)
Jul 27 12:54:55 <nboldt>	yeah, that's why I'm bringing it up
Jul 27 12:55:08 <nboldt>	to avoid "which base do you mean?" questions
Jul 27 12:55:20 <mbenitez>	could it be something like IDE?
Jul 27 12:55:32 <akurtakov>	so we make it which ide :)
Jul 27 12:55:48 <akurtakov>	I tried to stick to shared(components) but it didn't work better
Jul 27 12:55:56 <akurtakov>	kind of lost hope to clarify this one
Jul 27 12:56:13 <mbenitez>	well, it's rh-eclipse-ide...
Jul 27 12:56:25 <mbenitez>	but base is fine with me
Jul 27 12:57:54 <mbooth>	akurtakov: It could be rh-eclipse46-shared-components, if you like your RPM names nice and descriptive ;-)
Jul 27 12:58:20 <akurtakov>	mbooth: well, I read the %description usually :)
Jul 27 12:58:34 <akurtakov>	it's not me that cares about this one :)
Jul 27 12:59:08 <mbenitez>	actually, if the default is to install only the common stuff that should be rh-eclipse46
Jul 27 12:59:39 <mbenitez>	then instead of a base we'd have an rh-eclipse-all or linux or such
Jul 27 12:59:46 <mbooth>	I mean, it's pretty academic, because the devstudio RPM would just have Requires: rh-eclipse46-whatever-we-call-it and users will never see it
Jul 27 13:01:22 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I dislike going against the established convention of what you get when you install the unadorned "rh-eclipse46" package (do we want to have different behaviour to other SCLs?)
Jul 27 13:02:31 <mbenitez>	mbooth, agreed on not going against convention, where will the devstudio rpm live?
Jul 27 13:02:41 <mbenitez>	rh-eclipse46-devstudio?
Jul 27 13:04:14 <mbooth>	Good question...
Jul 27 13:04:44 <mbenitez>	I think once we figure that we can get the names straight
Jul 27 13:05:03 <mbooth>	If it's not shipping as part of the SCL, it doesn't need to have the rh-eclipse46 prefix
Jul 27 13:05:20 <mbenitez>	if it is inside the collection [which I think makes sense] then the meta will install it too
Jul 27 13:05:59 <mbenitez>	if it's not inside the collection it would be another collection, in theory a separate channel...
Jul 27 13:07:15 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Can we ship binary-only rpms through a RHEL channel?
Jul 27 13:07:17 <mbenitez>	the idea is to ship an 'eclipse product' with potentially 2 customer bases: devstudio and c/c++
Jul 27 13:09:00 <mbenitez>	mbooth, I don't know, I'd think no, maybe worth us talking to nboldt about how they are delivering things
Jul 27 13:09:15 <mbenitez>	maybe we should schedule a call for that
Jul 27 13:09:55 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: I think we should go with the freedom to have yum repo separately for now
Jul 27 13:10:15 <akurtakov>	not puting it in any channel and etc.
Jul 27 13:10:22 <mbenitez>	ok
Jul 27 13:10:31 <akurtakov>	just generate the devstudio rpms and run createrepo
Jul 27 13:11:29 <akurtakov>	if/when someone clears the shipping not-build from source in channels
Jul 27 13:11:40 <akurtakov>	we can think of having channel for it
Jul 27 13:12:16 <akurtakov>	but for the initial release that would be an overkill as I would bet this question will not be cleared :)
Jul 27 13:23:25 <mbooth>	mbenitez: BTW, erratum is created: https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/24366
Jul 27 13:23:47 <mbooth>	Had to also make the bug "modified"
Jul 27 13:24:35 <mbooth>	Should be called "BureaucracyZilla"
Jul 27 13:25:47 <nboldt>	mbenitez: we deliver things via a release-engineering@redhat.com / RCM ticket. siege then copies the zips & jars from internal server to CSP stging server and download manager, gets approval from QE, and pushes things to production.
Jul 27 13:26:39 <nboldt>	I've no idea what the rules are for binary-only RPMs, but we ship binary-only installer & update sites, with either a sources zip beside it or a link back to github for fresh sources
Jul 27 13:32:13 <mbooth>	nboldt: A yum repo is not that different to a p2 repo -- your rpms could probably be the same way.
Jul 27 13:32:30 <mbooth>	s/probably be/probably be delivered/
Jul 27 13:32:55 <nboldt>	so we're currently thinking of rh-eclipse46-base, rh-eclipse46-c++, and rh-eclipse46-devstudio as the three rpms?
Jul 27 13:33:17 <nboldt>	mbooth: ^ ?
Jul 27 13:33:49 <nboldt>	or maybe the second one is called rh-eclipse46-linuxtools-and-profiling-and-cdt-and-so-on....
Jul 27 13:34:34 <mbooth>	nboldt: Or maybe "rh-eclipse46-dts" instead of "...c++" since you'd get the same tools as your used to from the old DTS product
Jul 27 13:35:00 <nboldt>	ah, ok
Jul 27 13:35:14 <nboldt>	mbooth: so we have a "base/commons/whatever" one and two named for products?
Jul 27 13:35:50 <nboldt>	rh-eclipse46-basic-common-shared-stuff, rh-eclipse46-dts, rh-eclipse46-devstudio ?
Jul 27 13:35:57 <mbooth>	Sounds reasonable
Jul 27 13:36:11 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Thoughts? ^
Jul 27 13:36:15 <nboldt>	but these are metapackages for stuff underneath, right?
Jul 27 13:36:22 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yes
Jul 27 13:36:39 <nboldt>	so rh-eclipse46-devstudio would actually install things like eclipse-webtools, eclipse-datatools, eclipse-gef, eclipse-mylyn, ...
Jul 27 13:37:00 <nboldt>	and possibly an rpm called devstudio-javaee-datatools-something-something
Jul 27 13:37:29 <akurtakov>	mbooth: what do you ask exactly?
Jul 27 13:38:00 <nboldt>	akurtakov: names of the three RHSCL metpackages: rh-eclipse46-basic-common-shared-stuff, rh-eclipse46-dts, rh-eclipse46-devstudio ?
Jul 27 13:38:10 <nboldt>	metapackages*
Jul 27 13:39:07 <akurtakov>	the third one rh-eclipse46-devstudio can be named just rhdevstudio as it woud not come from this metapackage as content for it will not be in that channel
Jul 27 13:40:00 <akurtakov>	so rh-eclipse46-dts will be additional Provides to rh-eclipse46 (as this one must install the whole scl as per convention)
Jul 27 13:40:52 <akurtakov>	actually eclipse is separate scl now
Jul 27 13:40:59 <nboldt>	akurtakov: so you'd call the three packages rh-eclipse46, rh-eclipse46-dts, and rhdevstudio ?
Jul 27 13:41:12 <akurtakov>	so we should not mention scl 
Jul 27 13:41:15 <akurtakov>	er dts
Jul 27 13:41:26 <nboldt>	because product no longer exists?
Jul 27 13:41:37 <nboldt>	*will no longer* exist?
Jul 27 13:41:42 <akurtakov>	no, because eclipse is split from it
Jul 27 13:41:58 <akurtakov>	and dts becomes toolchain (gcc, gdb...) only
Jul 27 13:43:01 <akurtakov>	so rh-eclipse46 is the current dts eclipse (Provides can be added for yum install "coolname" to work
Jul 27 13:43:31 <nboldt>	ok, can we at least decide what the devstudio "C" package will be called?
Jul 27 13:43:42 <akurtakov>	the only thing in question is what to append after rh-eclipse46- for the shared one
Jul 27 13:43:45 <nboldt>	devstudio-javaee (because it's mostly for javaee work) ?
Jul 27 13:43:54 <akurtakov>	I like rhdevstudio
Jul 27 13:44:01 <nboldt>	or rh-eclipse46-devstudio ?
Jul 27 13:44:11 <nboldt>	rhdevstudio is probably forbidden by Brand
Jul 27 13:44:19 <akurtakov>	meh :)
Jul 27 13:44:54 <nboldt>	having been on the receiving end of Brand/UX screwing me over not once but twice in the last GA release, I can assure you that we need to do things according to the Book Of Brand
Jul 27 13:45:11 <akurtakov>	so let it be rh-eclipse46-devstudio :)
Jul 27 13:45:13 <nboldt>	failure to adhere to their rules will result in 11th hour panic & extra work
Jul 27 13:45:16 <nboldt>	ok
Jul 27 13:45:46 <nboldt>	so in this context "devstudio" is all the stuff that makes the current devstudio be devstudio, EXCEPT its upstream eclipse-* dependencies
Jul 27 13:45:53 <akurtakov>	I would rather see UX people starting eclipse and working on simplifying real UX 
Jul 27 13:46:04 <akurtakov>	nboldt: yes
Jul 27 13:46:05 <nboldt>	thus jbosstools, com.jboss.devstudio.* features, and some eclipse stuff that's not avaialble in rpms
Jul 27 13:47:00 <akurtakov>	UX should deal with real UX like https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/ not with package names
Jul 27 13:49:28 <akurtakov>	e.g. smth like https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Boxes for the docker plugins 
Jul 27 13:49:52 <akurtakov>	but I can only dream on focusing on real, user facing stuff
Jul 27 13:51:52 <nboldt>	mbenitez: if it would help, I can add people to the eclipse-list@ list for you. but you'll have to make me an admin and fwd me a list of email addresses
Jul 27 13:56:59 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thanks for the offer!
Jul 27 13:57:07 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_: have I captured all the testing cases you want here? https://trello.com/c/nW3ajKJa/7-wrap-new-devstudio-javaee-update-site-inside-an-rpm-for-linux-installs
Jul 27 13:57:28 <nboldt>	if you want to split that into another card so you can track QE stuff separately, feel free
Jul 27 13:58:05 <nboldt>	(much of the discussion at the G2 sprint plan was "is a card done if the doc's not done? what if the work's done, the doc's done, but the doc's not QE'd?"
Jul 27 13:58:24 <nboldt>	... to which I would say "you need a second card for the doc team's work")
Jul 27 13:58:33 <mbenitez>	mbooth, I like the new name "BureaucracyZilla" :D thanks for creating the errata
Jul 27 13:58:59 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, looking
Jul 27 14:28:12 <akazakov>	nboldt, why do you call it devstudio-javaee ?
Jul 27 14:28:26 <akazakov>	it's not only javee stuff, right?
Jul 27 14:29:13 <nboldt>	got a better name, akazakov ?
Jul 27 14:29:21 <nboldt>	devstudio-devstudio seems daft
Jul 27 14:29:31 <nboldt>	and devstudio-common isn't true
Jul 27 14:29:45 <akazakov>	javaee is not true either..
Jul 27 14:29:53 <nboldt>	we already use "devstudio core" to differentiate from integration stack, so it's a subset of core
Jul 27 14:30:01 <nboldt>	devstudio-subcore?
Jul 27 14:30:42 <akazakov>	this name is for update site only, correct?
Jul 27 14:31:10 <nboldt>	yes
Jul 27 14:31:26 <nboldt>	to differentiate it from the core, central, earlyaccess, targetplatform-*, etc.
Jul 27 14:36:37 <akazakov>	nboldt, I don't know.. maybe devstudio-tools.. I'm bad with names...

Jul 28 11:30:58 <ericwill>	akurtakov good news: ipun and I are working on a patch with the GTK guys for the font business
Jul 28 11:31:10 <ericwill>	early testing shows that it fixes the bug

Aug 01 12:53:05 <akurtakov>	mbooth: sorry, I'm still doing proof reading :)
Aug 01 12:53:15 <mbooth>	akurtakov: What do you think it should say now it's not part of DTS?
Aug 01 12:53:23 <mbooth>	Just "Eclipse Neon" maybe?
Aug 01 12:53:39 <akurtakov>	Red Hat Eclipse?

Aug 02 11:34:38 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: jjohnstn: hello ! would you be available tomorrow for a quick weekly call ? We now have our own dashboard on JIRA for the sprint planning (https://issues.jboss.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=3636&view=planning), so we could discuss about it and see what we plan to do for the current sprint. 
Aug 02 11:43:21 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: i'm available.. not sure if jeff is back.
Aug 02 11:43:53 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: oh, I thought he was back yesterday. Or is it on Thursday ? 
Aug 02 11:44:34 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: i don't see him as being on pto..so i'm guessing should be today.
Aug 02 11:44:53 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: ^
Aug 02 11:51:28 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: tomorrow is fine...what time?
Aug 02 11:52:08 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: rgrunber: same as usual ? 9am for you / 3pm for you ?
Aug 02 11:59:12 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: jjohnstn: I just sent the invitations for tomorrow. Please let me know if this works for you
Aug 02 11:59:45 <xcoulon>	or if you want it a bit later (but not too much, I also have family constraints at 5pm CET)
Aug 02 12:31:05 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: it is fine..can you look at: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22274 and tell me why I keep getting messages saying: "This email is the result of a query to locate stalled/invalid jiras. Please fix them. Thanks!"
Aug 02 12:40:56 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: we have a daily job that queries the JIRA issues and find erroneous issues. You should have more info about what's wrong in the mail body, but at first sight, I would say that's because the issue is set to be fixed in 4.4.1.AM1 which is past and the issue is still opened. So you should probably set a new fix version.
Aug 02 12:42:35 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: thx, I changed to 4.4.1.AM2 so hopefully that is ok
Aug 02 12:42:46 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: yes, I guess it will be fine

Aug 03 06:47:16 <akurtakov>	mbooth: scela: what comes from mylyn incubation?
Aug 03 06:47:40 <scela>	akurtakov: i don't think the trick was done in incubation
Aug 03 06:47:46 <scela>	rather in the main repo
Aug 03 06:48:38 <akurtakov>	I was thinking as incubation usually creates some issues
Aug 03 06:48:49 <akurtakov>	we may decide dropping it from mylyn package
Aug 03 06:49:02 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Some Trac plugin and some "Web Tasks" plugin
Aug 03 06:49:07 <akurtakov>	and what comes from it could be separate one if at all needed 
Aug 03 06:49:36 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Basically scela was foiled by some "creative release engineering"

Aug 03 09:13:17 *	rgrunber looks
Aug 03 09:14:15 <rgrunber>	ah indirectly referenced.. hmm seems like that would be a 'plugin' bug.. ie.. needs an import package on it.. or at least to add to that .java file.
Aug 03 09:14:43 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to mattn
Aug 03 09:17:26 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Interesting, I wonder why it did work previously
Aug 03 09:17:50 <rgrunber>	.. could it be a change in swtbot ?
Aug 03 09:18:30 <rgrunber>	i mean indirectly referenced happens for things like doing foo().bar() where bar() returns a class you don't import or whatnot..
Aug 03 09:18:39 <rgrunber>	from what i remember..
Aug 03 09:20:25 <mbooth>	I mean, why did it work before applying that patch? Nothing else should have changed
Aug 03 09:20:49 <mbooth>	Those locally installed bundles messing it up?
Aug 03 09:21:42 <rgrunber>	hmmm
Aug 03 09:22:11 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Hi, we are talking about https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1362178
Aug 03 09:22:32 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: I wonder if the problem goes away if you clear your ~/.eclipse again
Aug 03 09:23:30 <rgrunber>	the other thing is i may need to properly fix things.. ie..the fix vkadlcik has now isn't complete..
Aug 03 09:24:34 <rgrunber>	also is the org.eclipse.swt in the plugins folder identical to the one on the system... i would try to confirm.. if he used a very new swtbot it might have fetched a newer swt...
Aug 03 09:30:11 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, hi Roland, if you're joining the call now I'm in Yonge if you want to join
Aug 03 09:30:37 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: sure, i'll head over there.. just finishing up current docker call
Aug 03 09:31:26 <mbenitez>	sure, no worries
Aug 03 09:33:45 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: i'm very sorry but i'm in network problems now and my irc is practically unusable
Aug 03 09:33:49 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: the problem persists even with deleted ~/.eclipse

Aug 03 10:25:59 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik_gone: i can have a look.. assuming mbooth isn't on the machine testing.
Aug 03 10:26:16 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Not yet :-)

Aug 03 11:42:28 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i was just gonna ask about that :P
Aug 03 11:42:42 <mbooth>	Ask what?
Aug 03 11:42:52 <rgrunber>	mbooth: accessing the rh-eclipse stuff.
Aug 03 11:42:57 <mbooth>	Aha
Aug 03 11:43:09 <mbooth>	Then that was just for you ;-)
Aug 03 11:43:19 <rgrunber>	also if you're away and i may need to push changes from fedora eclipse into that rh-eclipse..

Aug 03 11:45:02 <rgrunber>	ah, awesome
Aug 03 11:53:12 <mbenitez>	thanks for the email mbooth 
Aug 03 11:55:00 <mbooth>	mbenitez: No worries, I expected backlash due to sending HTML email ;-)
Aug 03 11:55:20 <mbenitez>	haha
Aug 03 11:55:53 <mbooth>	Oh cripes I sent it to the wrong list -- sorry
Aug 03 11:57:56 <mbenitez>	no worries, this is new
Aug 03 11:58:34 <rgrunber>	mbooth: one question about the bug in rh-eclipse. when vkadlcik_gone outlined the steps to reproduce, those are things that worked on dts-4.. and not thing that worked on rh-eclipse prior to my patch.. right ?
Aug 03 11:59:46 <rgrunber>	ah .. umm nvm.. yeah it would imply the patch failed..
Aug 03 12:00:06 <rgrunber>	since for 3 to fail all of 1-2 had to work..
Aug 03 12:04:22 <mbooth>	Yeah, everything except installation worked on rh-eclipse prior to the patch
Aug 03 12:05:57 <rgrunber>	mbooth: what i'm seeing is that no platform bundle is detected by the target platform which seems unrelated.. i'll debug it to see.
Aug 03 12:06:07 <rgrunber>	which would explain why it isn't being found.
Aug 03 12:13:16 <mbenitez>	ldimaggi, thank you for all the updates Len!
Aug 03 12:13:45 <ldimaggi>	mbenitez, just trying to tie up the many loose ends!   ;-)

Aug 03 13:29:18 <rgrunber>	mbooth: problem in the bug seems to be solved by the patch i'll end up applying to fix the 'p2.runnable' problem.
Aug 03 13:29:50 <mbooth>	That's good, right?
Aug 03 13:30:12 <rgrunber>	yup.. so first patch caused issues likely because it wasn't completed.. and p2.runnable is needed.
Aug 03 13:30:55 <rgrunber>	in fact what occured is bundles.info never got generated in the user's $HOME/.eclipse.. so of course target platform generation failed... because it was looking for the bundles.info there.
Aug 03 13:31:08 <rgrunber>	it found the droplets just fine.. but not any of the platform files.

Aug 03 15:52:07 <ericwill>	mbooth haha, I can imagine :)
Aug 03 15:52:50 <ericwill>	as a side note, I'm really impressed by the number of old bugs that have snippet reproducers attached
Aug 03 15:52:53 <ericwill>	really makes life easier
Aug 03 15:59:23 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Would you quickly try something for me?
Aug 03 15:59:30 <rgrunber>	mbooth: sure
Aug 03 16:00:02 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I just sent you a script and a spec file...
Aug 03 16:00:45 <rgrunber>	i'm guessing you want me to build it..
Aug 03 16:01:01 <mbooth>	(Based on your original script) Running this script should result in a binary RPM that installs some droplets generated from p2 repos
Aug 03 16:01:32 <mbooth>	Yes please, also please take a look to see if its sane
Aug 03 16:02:08 <mbooth>	Actually a yum repo, not just a binary rpm
Aug 03 16:02:11 <rgrunber>	ahh.. one thing i probably also missed from the repo2runnable script, the option '-flagAsRunnable'
Aug 03 16:04:18 <rgrunber>	so basically you assume some source folder exists called %{?scl_prefix}devstudio.tar.gz or whatnot.. you extract its contents.. then you call feature/bundle publisher to create the p2 repo from it.. i mean the paths would need to match up.. between the location of those bundles and 'file:$(pwd)/p2-repo'..
Aug 03 16:05:18 <mbooth>	The build.sh generates the tarball and the srpm, so paths should always br correct
Aug 03 16:05:25 <rgrunber>	ah.. d'oh
Aug 03 16:06:27 <rgrunber>	ah.. build.sh is the thing being executed
Aug 03 16:06:42 <mbooth>	Yes, that wasn't clear, sorry
Aug 03 16:08:24 <mbooth>	Assumptions made: Machine you are running this on can run mock (Fedora, probably) and you are inside the firewall (so you can build RHEL7 chroot)
Aug 03 16:08:57 <mbooth>	My thinking is that using mock should give pretty reproducible results outside of brew
Aug 03 16:11:41 <rgrunber>	k seems to be working.. downloaded stuff.. wrote the srpm..
Aug 03 16:12:10 <rgrunber>	doing the mock build now...
Aug 03 16:15:06 <rgrunber>	mbooth: there's one improvement that could be made from that 'p2_feature_curl' thing i wrote.. and that's to actually call the director to install the units. it would require the user list all repositories (like http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon) but we could do some logic afterwards like.. is this bundle from the p2 repo we care about or one of the others.. and decide whether to add it to the 
Aug 03 16:15:12 <rgrunber>	droplet on that criteria.
Aug 03 16:15:39 <rgrunber>	^ that would give us things like docker-client, jersey, ... in the case of linuxtools.docker.. instead of forcing there to be some feature that lists everything.
Aug 03 16:19:24 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yeah i guess for reproducibility you'd need to run it inside mock.. is it worth supplying an option in the future for the user to point to their own eclipse install.. i mean it'd be much faster should they choose that..
Aug 03 16:20:11 <mbooth>	Well, second run is faster since the mock root is cached
Aug 03 16:21:47 <mbooth>	And it's kind of just going be hooked into their existing deploy process -- I don't see people wanting to invoke this manually that much
Aug 03 16:23:21 <mbooth>	I see what you mean about improving 'p2_feature_curl' though
Aug 03 16:25:50 <rgrunber>	yeah we need p2's dep resolution greatness.. but then we want to remove all jars that came from somewhere else... or ... i think if we somehow use the system eclipse's profile.. it should.. not bring in the whole platform..
Aug 03 16:25:56 <rgrunber>	something to test though...
Aug 03 16:29:38 <rgrunber>	yay building the rpm..
Aug 03 16:31:30 <rgrunber>	mbooth: works for me.. built the yum repo contents seem right.
Aug 03 16:32:53 <mbooth>	Good :-)
Aug 03 16:34:07 <mbooth>	Building a second time should be super quick (the whole of maven is in the build root, a bit unnecessarily for this)
Aug 03 16:34:16 <rgrunber>	ah you even got rid of the feature.jars
Aug 03 16:34:43 <rgrunber>	ah nvm.. expanded on it to do features..
Aug 03 16:37:20 <rgrunber>	yeah this is awesome, nicely done.

Aug 04 07:08:38 <scela>	vkadlcik: np
Aug 04 07:25:27 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: No, that is not intentional :-( I guess file lists need refreshing in errata or something otherwise the SCL might not be installable from the compose :-(

Aug 05 10:24:18 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: ping.. ?
Aug 05 10:24:32 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: pong
Aug 05 10:24:50 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: is there access to the machine on which the slowness is happening ?
Aug 05 10:28:21 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: i'll prepare it, give me 15 min
Aug 05 10:28:50 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: i'm trying it out on 10.16.186.62 but wasn't able to reproduce huge delay yet..
Aug 05 10:34:21 <rgrunber>	ok nvm.. i've reproduced something that takes long. might be a similar cause.
Aug 05 10:41:39 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: so just in case: vncviewer ibm-ls22-04.rhts.eng.brq.redhat.com:1, password is redhat
Aug 05 10:41:58 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: it's starting -application org.eclipse.swtbot.eclipse.junit.headless.swtbottestapplication
Aug 05 10:42:34 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: now in about 3 min from my command
Aug 05 10:42:47 <rgrunber>	yup i see..
Aug 05 10:43:05 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: i won't be using the machine today
Aug 05 10:43:27 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: all the passwords should be redhat
Aug 05 10:47:01 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: can you try instead of calling 'eclipse' for the time being, to replace it with 'java -jar /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/lib*/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launch_*.jar .. that seemed to make a huge difference when i was trying it out..
Aug 05 10:47:35 <rgrunber>	also it seems only the first run is insanely slow, definitely droplets related though.
Aug 05 10:50:04 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: i used to do it that way but one it needs more parameters and they seem to differ between versions so i ended up with simple 'eclipse'
Aug 05 10:50:26 <vkadlcik>	s/ one//
Aug 05 10:52:20 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: yeah can be a bit trick to always try to find the equinox launcher.. just a workaround until i figure a solution for the issue.
Aug 05 10:56:56 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: finding the launcher isn't tricky, the problem was to add all the additional switches in a way that would work across all supported eclipse versions
Aug 05 10:57:17 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: but i can do it, in the worst case :-)
Aug 05 10:57:22 <rgrunber>	ah wait for tests there's additional paramaters other than just what you specified.. ?
Aug 05 11:01:34 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: hmm, nope, please stick with what's in bugzilla; what i do normally is out of scope
Aug 05 11:01:45 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: sorry for the confusion

Aug 08 05:43:37 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Hi, sure -- let me take a look now
Aug 08 05:44:44 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to palves
Aug 08 05:59:37 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Okay done, hopefully that should be better
Aug 08 06:09:16 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: thanks, just checked - still rh-eclipse46-build is missing
Aug 08 06:09:29 <mbooth>	D'oh
Aug 08 06:19:29 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: I don't know how to fix this one -- even removing and re-adding the build did not work :-(
Aug 08 06:19:35 <mbooth>	Let me ask rzima
Aug 08 06:20:54 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: ack

Aug 08 09:49:26 <mbooth>	Morning, mbenitez 
Aug 08 09:49:44 <mbenitez>	mbooth, hello Mat, how was your long weekend?
Aug 08 09:50:01 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Nice and sunny, thanks :-)
Aug 08 09:50:12 <mbenitez>	excellent :)
Aug 08 09:51:02 <mbooth>	mbenitez: You should know that there was a slight problem reported with the alpha hand-off that needs PM clarification: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1365100
Aug 08 09:51:24 *	mbenitez looks
Aug 08 09:53:28 <mbenitez>	mbooth, interesting, I didn't know rhscl doesn't provide this build feature
Aug 08 09:54:27 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Me neither, this caught us by surprise
Aug 08 09:54:48 <mbenitez>	mbooth, I just asked briang in #devtoolset, thanks fro bringing this up
Aug 08 10:36:47 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: woohoo ! it took me a bit of time, but I've just managed to parse the Docker Compose output, read the ANSI escape codes and print in the MessageConsole with proper text coloring: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4v1y94fpgzayxx0/Screenshot%202016-08-08%2016.29.25.png?dl=0
Aug 08 10:37:19 <xcoulon>	there's still work to do, though
Aug 08 10:40:21 <rgrunber>	looks good to me. we can probably use that same work to support container logs that have escape codes.. without moving them to tm terminal.
Aug 08 10:45:09 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, that was my thought too. I suggest we discuss about it in an upcoming change, ok ?
Aug 08 10:46:39 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to mbenitez
Aug 08 10:46:55 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: sure. btw is this something you've written from scratch ? or based on existing stuff from projects that have done the same.
Aug 08 10:47:18 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: nope, I wrote it from scratch
Aug 08 10:47:47 <rgrunber>	i might look at other projects that have done it to ensure we support all possible codes.
Aug 08 10:49:24 <rgrunber>	i mean specifically for things like colours, or really uncommon codes.
Aug 08 11:55:01 <rgrunber>	mbooth: thanks for offering hope in that automated testing bug. i'm interested to discover what's causing reconciler to take 10min to decide to do (i hope) nothing but if disabling it is an option we can probably discuss.

Aug 08 12:01:31 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Good question :-)
Aug 08 12:09:09 <mbenitez>	you can consider this release a major so no commitments to backwards functionality if that helps
Aug 08 12:12:53 <rgrunber>	yeah, i guess we can just disable it in the worst case. Figuring out the real issue becomes a bit of a bonus, assuming ptp migration to droplets goes smoothly.

Aug 09 11:05:16 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: I don't think you will have missed anything vital, there was mostly just talk about BZ/Jira integration :-)
Aug 09 11:05:33 <rgrunber>	mbooth: so about the p2_feature_curl part, i'm guessing that currently doesn't pick up transitive dependencies.. ie only stuff that's a direct dep of the feature ?
Aug 09 11:05:54 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: thanks
Aug 09 11:07:49 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Yes -- but I did add an option to download a "whole" update site (i.e. if you don't specify a feature it lists all IUs with a jar payload and downloads everything)
Aug 09 11:08:18 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yup, i think i saw it in the updated version.
Aug 09 11:08:31 <nboldt>	mbenitez: mbooth: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22966
Aug 09 11:08:53 <nboldt>	If I missed anything important or screwed anything up, please edit the JIRA or throw comments on it
Aug 09 11:10:12 <rgrunber>	i mentioned it before a bit but was thinking of changing that to call the p2 director to install the feature.group iu (with empty profile specified). this way script only needs to specify the main p2 repo, and the locatin of other repos for which platform/additional content exists. from there we just remove the additional content and are left with just the jars needed from the main repo.
Aug 09 11:10:43 <rgrunber>	added benefit would be that it should support composites since director takes care of it.
Aug 09 11:11:09 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thank you! I had it in my TODO to file the issue as you requested :)
Aug 09 11:11:33 <nboldt>	rgrunber: I'm going to be doing something very similar for the rh-eclipse46-devstudio rpm creation
Aug 09 11:11:41 <nboldt>	rgrunber: we should combine forces :D
Aug 09 11:12:13 <nboldt>	mbenitez: 
Aug 09 11:12:50 <nboldt>	mbenitez: one question ... not sure I'll be able to get this written this week as well as getting the RPM stuff prototyped. I'm going to assume bzira scrape is less important than rpm creation
Aug 09 11:13:12 <mbenitez>	vkadlcik_gone, thank you for joining!
Aug 09 11:14:46 <rgrunber>	nboldt: yeah, so the problem i want to address is that generally features don't include *everything* they need, so for linuxtools.docker you probably won't get jersey*,jnr*,jackson* even though they should be in the droplet.
Aug 09 11:15:37 <nboldt>	ah, then the feature owner should revamp the feature (or better, its plugins) to proeprly declare dependencies and versions
Aug 09 11:15:49 <nboldt>	don't fix this in your tool. make the projects upstream behave correctly :D
Aug 09 11:15:59 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ^
Aug 09 11:16:42 <rgrunber>	nboldt: well, not really, because that's how features work. a feature just says "these are things i'm providing that i own".. it would kinda be abusing osgi if you decided to include everything needed.
Aug 09 11:17:17 <mbooth>	Eclipse features are an abuse of OSGi anyway :-p
Aug 09 11:17:38 <rgrunber>	i mean if you ran the director it works fine.. problem is when you query a feature for its dependencies, you'll only get the immediate plugins.. not all deps recursively.
Aug 09 11:17:43 <nboldt>	rgrunber: MANIFEEST.MF in plugins are SUPPOSED to define their deps
Aug 09 11:18:16 <nboldt>	feature is a more loose definition of requirements but you can certainly set includes AND deps in feature.xml
Aug 09 11:18:39 <nboldt>	best practices says to do the dep declaration in the plugins, but if there's a good reason to move that into the feature, it can be done there too
Aug 09 11:18:43 <nboldt>	(or instead)
Aug 09 11:19:11 <mbooth>	I think you are agreeing with one another...
Aug 09 11:19:13 <nboldt>	tldr, the problem is in the upstream plugins' MANIFEST.MF files. Fix those and your tools will work correctly
Aug 09 11:19:37 <rgrunber>	yeah.. so that's what i'm getting at.. if we just call the director, we'll get what we need.
Aug 09 11:21:00 <rgrunber>	what we're doing now is getting just the feature.group requirements.. and stopping there.. or downloading the entire repo, which i guess would assume the repo is a 1-1 mapping with the droplet content.. which again might not be true upstream.
Aug 09 11:23:17 <nboldt>	exactly. director (or p2.mirror) is better than whatever else you're using as it doesn't read p2 metadata
Aug 09 11:23:25 <nboldt>	it = whatever else
Aug 09 11:23:56 <nboldt>	director will install things (unpack jars); p2.mirror will simply copy them as is
Aug 09 11:23:59 <rgrunber>	nboldt: well the feature getting thing works in some special cases (feature defines everything needed, entire p2 repo is the droplet)
Aug 09 11:27:06 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i mean i don't mind working on this if i can get some time.. i had something written up, but unless you're already working on it..
Aug 09 11:29:14 <nboldt>	I need to (re)create a script that can, for a list of features, produce an update site
Aug 09 11:29:33 <nboldt>	I think that might be a different usecase than you if you're using director to unpack the features
Aug 09 11:31:04 <rgrunber>	nboldt: so given an update site and list of features, it produces a more compact update site ?..
Aug 09 11:31:15 <rgrunber>	excluding non-essential stuff.
Aug 09 11:31:32 <nboldt>	yes
Aug 09 11:31:43 <nboldt>	that's what I need for the rh-eclipse46-devstudio RPM
Aug 09 11:31:50 <nboldt>	based on mbooth's build.sh script
Aug 09 11:31:59 <rgrunber>	nboldt: it's quite similar. we want to do the same, except our final output is a droplet, not another update site.
Aug 09 11:32:08 <rgrunber>	oh.. :P hah
Aug 09 11:32:23 <nboldt>	is a droplet "given an update site, install everything in it" ?
Aug 09 11:33:16 <rgrunber>	nboldt: droplet is just an update site that has had the repo2runnable task run on it with -createFragments.
Aug 09 11:34:06 <nboldt>	ah... so yes. same use case then
Aug 09 11:34:19 <nboldt>	I believe the rh-eclipse46-devstudio RPM is thus "a droplet" too :D
Aug 09 11:34:24 *	nboldt is learning the terms here
Aug 09 11:35:52 <rgrunber>	nboldt: basically i'm saying, if we modify the p2_feature_curl method in build.sh to call the director to install.. and do a bit of pruning of unnecessary things, then you no longer need to do what you were going to do.. or at least do less..
Aug 09 11:36:44 <nboldt>	rgrunber: oh... that's cool
Aug 09 11:37:04 <nboldt>	that would possibly save time / effort and be reusable for your stuff too
Aug 09 11:37:29 <nboldt>	I'll be in the office this afternoon so we can talk more in person (if you're in today)
Aug 09 11:37:44 <rgrunber>	nboldt: the only thing that i'd need to know, is would there be some kind of update site that contains things like "org.eclipse.ui, org.eclipse.platform, ... base platform stuff"
Aug 09 11:38:01 <nboldt>	yes! we have that 
Aug 09 11:38:03 <rgrunber>	ie. that is used in devtools product ..
Aug 09 11:38:11 <rgrunber>	worst case i use releases/neon or whatnot
Aug 09 11:38:43 <nboldt>	point director at https://devstudio.jboss.com/10.0/stable/updates/ and if it can scrape children of the composite all the deps you need should be there
Aug 09 11:39:00 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to jjohnstn
Aug 09 11:39:03 <nboldt>	since that site contains devstudio + devstudio target platform
Aug 09 11:39:32 <nboldt>	rgrunber: we also have the same site as 4 zips, if you want to play offline and save b/w download time for iterative experiments
Aug 09 11:40:01 <nboldt>	zips are linked on https://devstudio.jboss.com/10.0/stable/updates/ in the right hand column under "Offline Install"
Aug 09 11:40:04 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ^
Aug 09 11:43:23 <rgrunber>	yeah i'll have to play around with things.. a lot of this work will vary depending on what assumptions/input data is being given.
Aug 09 11:44:07 <nboldt>	yep
Aug 09 11:46:02 <rgrunber>	nboldt: oh final thing :P , is there any plan to map issue states (NEW,ASSIGNED,..,VERIFIED,CLOSED) into jira ?
Aug 09 11:46:51 <rgrunber>	can be slight pain to remember to change a bug twice (once in bz, once in jira)
Aug 09 11:46:52 <nboldt>	currently no, the tool only creates the JIRA
Aug 09 11:47:11 <nboldt>	but in future yes, we could have VERIFIED => resolved, CLOSED -> closed
Aug 09 11:47:24 <nboldt>	add that to the JIRA I opened (or make a subtask?)
Aug 09 11:47:38 <nboldt>	rgrunber: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22966 
Aug 09 11:48:01 <rgrunber>	yeah, sounds good, i'll do that

Aug 09 16:28:01 <nboldt>	rgrunber: any progress on scripting a replacement to go in build.sh ?
Aug 09 16:29:43 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i've got something already on my home laptop (which isn't here with me) but i'm sure it'll work.
Aug 09 16:30:16 <rgrunber>	was working on it around the time i handed off the script to Mat but got sidetracked.
Aug 09 16:34:17 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ok, no worries. I'll work on something else and bug you again in a day or two :D
Aug 09 16:34:26 <nboldt>	no point reinventing your wheel 
Aug 09 16:34:45 <nboldt>	(but happy to review your code & test it out for my rpm)
Aug 09 16:35:24 <rgrunber>	nboldt: yeah np.. i should finish it quickly.. i thought i hit a rather annoying block with respect to associative arrays in bash.. but apparently they need to be explicitly enabled.
Aug 09 16:36:49 <nboldt>	haven't used assoc arrays in bash in a while but I don't recall that... just that you had to type-declare the object before loading it.
Aug 09 16:37:10 <rgrunber>	yeah.. that's what i meant.
Aug 09 16:38:18 <nboldt>	cool
Aug 09 16:38:50 <rgrunber>	as opposed to just foo["a.b.c"]=1
Aug 09 16:39:21 <rawblem>	rgrunber,  hey, where was that api for updating the details of a docker connection again?
Aug 09 16:39:25 <rawblem>	i seem to have misplaced it
Aug 09 16:39:48 *	nboldt sees rawblem and points at the Google in the corner, just waiting to be used
Aug 09 16:40:11 <rawblem>	nboldt,  if you seriously think i can find an api via google search and simply guessing class or method names, you're insane
Aug 09 16:40:23 <rgrunber>	rawblem: DockerConnectionManager.updateConnection or something..
Aug 09 16:40:28 <rawblem>	thnx

Aug 10 10:32:39 <rgrunber>	any plans to push that build.sh + devstudio.spec into some git repo.. ?
Aug 10 10:38:12 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I figured we'd let nboldt1 add it to some git repo since it will form a part of devstudio process, not SCL process

Aug 10 10:50:24 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: yes, I was going to put it in https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product
Aug 10 10:50:36 <nboldt1>	mbooth: ^
Aug 10 10:51:16 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: feel free to push. only slight concern is that it not be mandatory.. ie.. the code can handle it being null, or empty..
Aug 10 10:51:43 <rgrunber>	because i create IDockerConnectionSettings in some places associated with the extension point providers
Aug 10 10:52:58 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: if you create TCPConnectionSettings or UnixSocketConnectionSettings under the covers, that is already handled...empty properties are ok
Aug 10 10:53:07 <rgrunber>	k sounds good then.
Aug 10 10:53:11 <jjohnstn>	thx
Aug 10 10:55:11 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: so "p2extract ${dropletP2Repo} ${neededRepo1},${neededRepo2} ${groupFeatureID} ." replaces p2_feature_curl in build.sh?

Aug 10 12:13:24 <nboldt1>	rgrunber_mtg: cool, thanks. I've reworked your script a bit to perform the install for 212 features in one step instead of having to loop through 212 installs :D
Aug 10 12:14:02 <nboldt1>	and switched to using metadataRepository and artifactRepository because need that when using p2.director -list
Aug 10 12:23:24 <nboldt1>	rgrunber_mtg: the droplet-bundles folder is missing all the unpacked plugins. is that intentional?
Aug 10 12:24:19 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to ebaron
Aug 10 12:24:29 <nboldt1>	when I mirror all the features in devstudio, I get 643M of stuff, but then the part of p2extract that copies them to droplet_bundles folder only copies 373M of stuff
Aug 10 12:24:33 <nboldt1>	rgrunber_mtg: ^
Aug 10 12:38:16 <nboldt1>	rgrunber_mtg: also playing with -profileProperties org.eclipse.update.install.features=true so that features are included in the installation :D
Aug 10 12:59:28 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: unintentional.. needs improvement.. only worked for jars for now.
Aug 10 12:59:38 <nboldt1>	ok cool
Aug 10 12:59:55 <nboldt1>	working on bootstrapping this using update site jars for better performance of CI iterations
Aug 10 14:08:31 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: any new docker tooling to include in devstudio for tomorrow's code freeze?
Aug 10 14:08:34 <nboldt1>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22885 
Aug 10 14:09:17 <nboldt1>	I see org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.feature_2.1.0.201608052203.jar as latest in http://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools/updates-docker-nightly/features/?d ... should we include that or wait until close to Aug 30 to update?
Aug 10 14:09:22 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: ^
Aug 10 14:10:38 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: there are a bunch of bug fixes.. and some new features.. i wouldn't mind getting a nightly out.. assuming we can still ship whatever we have on august 30th also..
Aug 10 14:11:03 <nboldt1>	yeah, if you bump to a nightly now, you're comitting to releasing something stable by Aug 30
Aug 10 14:13:35 <jjohnstn>	nboldt1 I am building master right now to fix a problem with Oxygen M1...this will contain some additional fixes I have resolved as part of the latest sprint
Aug 10 14:15:34 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: so... ETA for new nightly I can include for eclipse 4.6.0-based builds of devstudio 10.1 / jbosstools 4.4.1?
Aug 10 14:15:40 <nboldt1>	today? tomorrow?
Aug 10 14:15:50 <jjohnstn>	nboldt1: today
Aug 10 14:15:59 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: before or after 5pm?
Aug 10 14:16:34 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: should be before 5 pm as I have already started the build
Aug 10 14:16:54 <jjohnstn>	nboldt1: ^
Aug 10 14:18:34 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: sweet, thanks
Aug 10 14:47:25 <jjohnstn>	nboldt1 I have finished the build which I copied to update-oxygen-docker-m1...you can use nightly if you wish

Aug 11 10:09:10 <mbooth>	nboldt: Thanks for Jira formatting hints :-) BTW, is there no "quote" or "reply" button? I can't find one
Aug 11 10:17:21 <nboldt>	there's just "comment"
Aug 11 10:17:24 <nboldt>	mbooth: ^
Aug 11 10:18:07 <nboldt>	mbooth: sorta like bugzilla in that respect. but NOT like bugzilla, you can do all kinds of formatting and even emojis
Aug 11 10:18:41 <nboldt>	you will learn to love {quote} and {code} and !image.png! and [^somefile.txt] 
Aug 11 10:18:56 <mbooth>	nboldt: I guess I just miss replying to comments in-line like I would with email/bugzilla 
Aug 11 10:19:13 <mbooth>	Copy/pasting someone's reply loses formatting :-(
Aug 11 10:19:17 <nboldt>	yeah, you can do that with RCM tickets, which are backed by jira/confluence
Aug 11 10:19:38 <nboldt>	mbooth: you can EDIT someone's comment to get it as code, then paste that
Aug 11 10:20:16 <mbooth>	I can edit other folks' comments? That sounds... dangerous :-o
Aug 11 10:21:32 <nboldt>	well, I can. maybe that's only an admin ability
Aug 11 10:21:55 <nboldt>	which reminds me I need to find someone with JIRA God Mode Powers to add a new project, RHECLIPSE

Aug 11 12:10:26 <nboldt>	dumb question... http://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/overview/ says "ON WINDOWS 8:" but surely the OpenJDK .msi installer works on Win 7/8/8.1/10 ?
Aug 11 12:11:13 <nboldt>	followup dumb question, where do I report a bug in that doc? JIRA -> DEVELOPER issue? 
Aug 11 12:11:25 <nboldt>	mbenitez: patrickm: ^
Aug 11 12:12:27 <mbenitez>	nboldt, the first question would be for dbhole / omajid they are in #toronto [in a team mtg in Westford now]
Aug 11 12:12:45 <mbenitez>	the second I don't know but let me find, it's something we'll just need more and more
Aug 11 12:14:52 <nboldt>	mbenitez: https://issues.jboss.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=3362&projectKey=DEVELOPER is where I generally open issues for developers.redhat.com updates (eg., to release new devstudio)
Aug 11 12:15:09 <nboldt>	but thought maybe you guys would have a different process for openjdk (eg.., bugzilla?)
Aug 11 12:15:46 <mbenitez>	nboldt, I think that should be it then, tbh we haven't filed anything yet
Aug 11 12:21:52 <nboldt>	mbenitez: I've opened https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DEVELOPER-3393 to track the problem
Aug 11 12:22:33 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thanks Nick! for that and teaching me where to report this stuff :)
Aug 11 12:24:15 <nboldt>	mbenitez: no problem. next, I need to introduce you to Paul Robinson, who can usually escalate things in DEVELOPER when they get stuck
Aug 11 12:24:40 <nboldt>	(He's @Paul in hipchat.)
Aug 11 12:25:34 <mbenitez>	nboldt, that would be nice, I need to open a request to post an Eclipse Infocentre, finally I'll have connections on this website
Aug 11 12:26:59 <nboldt>	oh god, really? You want an infocentre on developers.redhat.com? 
Aug 11 12:27:14 <nboldt>	(I assume you mean something like http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp ?
Aug 11 12:28:06 <nboldt>	mbenitez: or do you mean simply linking to docs on eclipse.org like the SystemTap UG? http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.doc%2FLinux_Tools_Project%2FSystemtap%2FUser_Guide%2FUser-Guide.html
Aug 11 12:28:53 <mbenitez>	nboldt, yes, like that: http://infocenter-mbooth.rhcloud.com/index.jsp
Aug 11 12:29:26 <mbenitez>	nboldt, mbooth put this together long time ago and we just couldn't get follow up on where to host it, the developer portal should be the right place
Aug 11 12:30:03 <mbenitez>	at the time we were talking to rkratky he didn't know who to contact yet, but finally all the pieces are coming together
Aug 11 12:30:05 <nboldt>	I bet you'll need to rebrand that before you can put it there
Aug 11 12:30:33 <nboldt>	yeah, rob should talk to @paul about how to host it (or if we can host it)
Aug 11 12:30:41 <mbenitez>	absolutely, the design was just temporary, to show other how this could be branded for the product
Aug 11 12:30:51 <nboldt>	could dump the whole thing into github I guess :D
Aug 11 12:31:26 <mbenitez>	nboldt, glad to have you around, you have a lot of insights into the processes :)
Aug 11 12:31:27 <nboldt>	mbenitez: that would be here: https://github.com/redhat-developer/developers.redhat.com
Aug 11 12:32:11 <nboldt>	probably more like here: https://github.com/redhat-developer/developers.redhat.com/tree/master/products/developertoolset
Aug 11 12:32:27 <mbenitez>	nice!
Aug 11 12:32:51 <mbenitez>	I'll open a trello card to start tracking this again, and of course a jira
Aug 11 12:33:21 <nboldt>	yeah. (aside: there's a great asciidoctor.js plugin for Chrome which is awesome for testing .adoc files locally before pushing them as a PR or having to use rake to build them)
Aug 11 12:34:43 <nboldt>	mbenitez: I suppose the other option would be for rkratky to look at publishing the infocentre as another "multiple html pages" format and have it here: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-developer-toolset/
Aug 11 12:35:11 <mbenitez>	it seems like a good project to include with the consolidation / UX improvements we're working towards
Aug 11 12:35:35 <nboldt>	eg., another "Paged HTML" document like https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/4/html/4.1_Release_Notes/index.html
Aug 11 12:35:49 <mbenitez>	nboldt, we talked about that but there were some concerns about the content not being internally created IIRC
Aug 11 12:35:50 <nboldt>	again, Brand might complain about that idea, but *shrug*
Aug 11 12:36:05 <mbenitez>	haha no kidding, processes... ;)
Aug 11 12:36:13 <nboldt>	internally created? where did mbooth build the infocentre?
Aug 11 12:38:39 <mbooth>	nboldt: The infocenter is *built* here, but much of the content was written upstream -- it was the origin of the content that was the concern, IIRC
Aug 11 12:39:23 <mbenitez>	I think so too
Aug 11 12:40:55 <nboldt>	mbooth: oic. another "NIH" paranoia event
Aug 11 12:40:58 <mbooth>	But it seems silly that even appropriately licensed documentation cannot be rehosted...
Aug 11 12:41:02 <mbooth>	Exactly
Aug 11 12:41:16 <nboldt>	mbooth: yeah, "silly" is one word for it
Aug 11 12:41:33 <nboldt>	are they worried that the doc source isn't open enough, being html?
Aug 11 12:41:57 *	nboldt points the lawyers at the CTRL and Y keys and tell them to view-source:
Aug 11 12:42:13 <nboldt>	(ctrl-U I mean)
Aug 11 12:42:33 <mbooth>	nboldt: TBH, I don't remember. But it's nothing that isn't already shipped inside an RPM...
Aug 11 12:43:16 <nboldt>	mbooth: ah, so if it's good enough to be IN RHEL it should be good enough to be online discussing what's IN RHEL
Aug 11 12:43:49 <mbenitez>	I don't think we got to legal last time, things just got lost in conversations and we never made it close to publish
Aug 11 12:49:06 <mbenitez>	nboldt, I opened https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DEVELOPER-3394 does it look good to you?
Aug 11 12:49:20 *	mbenitez has lost the JIRA-fu over time
Aug 11 12:49:45 <mbenitez>	also added the description to trello
Aug 11 12:49:58 <nboldt>	mbenitez: you should cross link them
Aug 11 12:50:19 <mbenitez>	add the trello card to JIRA?
Aug 11 12:50:22 <nboldt>	eg., JIRA -> More > Link > Web Link > url for the trello card
Aug 11 12:50:31 <mbenitez>	ok, will do
Aug 11 12:50:58 <nboldt>	Trello > card > add Checklist > add checklist item = https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DEVELOPER-3394
Aug 11 12:51:21 <nboldt>	that way the info is in both places and PgM can track from their side / devs can track from their side, etc.
Aug 11 12:51:29 <nboldt>	it's more time/effort but imho it helps :D
Aug 11 12:53:15 <mbenitez>	good idea, it doesn't hurt :)
Aug 11 12:57:53 <nboldt>	DEVELOPER-3394 is assigned to James Cobb (our branding guy)
Aug 11 13:17:30 <patrickm>	nboldt: where in the doc does it say Windows 8?
Aug 11 13:17:48 <patrickm>	ah, in *BOLD*
Aug 11 13:18:45 <patrickm>	arrrgh, they still didn't change the Red Hat OpenJDK title
Aug 11 13:40:25 *	fuhbot2 gives channel operator status to patrickm
Aug 11 14:24:26 <nboldt>	patrickm: yep. BOLD ALL CAPS, even :D
Aug 11 14:24:48 <patrickm>	nboldt: apparently I'm an idiot ;)
Aug 11 14:25:00 <nboldt>	patrickm: I've opened https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DEVELOPER-3393 to track the problem ... feel free to add more complaints / screenshots with big red arrows, etc.
Aug 11 14:25:14 <nboldt>	patrickm: no worries. we're all blind from time to time
Aug 11 14:27:38 <patrickm>	nboldt: i was looking for it in the text... that's my excuse and I'm sticking with that story
Aug 11 14:30:52 <nboldt>	patrickm: lol, no problem
Aug 11 14:31:10 <nboldt>	I opened the JIRA before noticing that there's RHEL 6 in there too (no mention of RHEL 7)

Aug 12 09:53:43 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok. I'm working on my patch as well. Some tests are broken so I need to fix them before submitting to gerrit again
Aug 12 10:59:34 <patrickm>	nboldt: i talked with dbhole, there is not restriction in the .msi that states it should only install on Windows 8
Aug 12 10:59:43 <patrickm>	nboldt: we'll get that corrected
Aug 12 11:00:25 <patrickm>	nboldt: it seems to be an oversight, there were so many "8"'s on that page
Aug 12 11:04:14 <nboldt>	patrickm: yeah, felt like an overzealous regex matching
Aug 12 11:04:25 <nboldt>	patrickm: but that doesn't explain the RHEL 6 mention :D
Aug 12 11:04:56 <nboldt>	more likely this page was boilerplated from a year or two ago before Win10 and RHEL 7 were things we support
Aug 12 11:05:12 <patrickm>	nboldt: it does, because the pkg names are different

Aug 16 10:54:27 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: hello Roland. Did you see my comment on Gerrit ? Actually, it's more or less the same as the one I posted on BZ. Could you update your patch ? BTW, this bug is a blocker for JBoss Tools 4.4.1.AM3, so just let me know if you don't have time to fix it today, I'll take care of it.
Aug 16 10:54:55 <xcoulon>	Then once it's good, we should trigger a build of the Docker tooling so that Nick can pull it into the TP of JBoss Tools.
Aug 16 10:55:41 <rgrunber>	sure i can change them to return an empty list.
Aug 16 11:00:21 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: great ! thanks
Aug 16 11:00:36 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: we should have tests to cover this, btw.
Aug 16 11:19:11 <nboldt>	xcoulon: dude. is this REALLY a blocker given that...
Aug 16 11:19:16 <nboldt>	AM3 = alpha release
Aug 16 11:19:21 <nboldt>	TP freeze was last week
Aug 16 11:19:57 <nboldt>	changing TP on the same day as the release/QE signoff day (today) means the release will likely delayed until tomorrow or Thurs
Aug 16 11:20:09 <nboldt>	...?
Aug 16 11:20:21 <xcoulon>	nboldt: I'm not the one to decide if this is a blocker. But it looks pretty bad, since the Docker Explorer view is broken on Windows, which means that the whole Docker tooling fails.
Aug 16 11:20:38 <xcoulon>	nboldt: can we discuss this with Alexey and Len, then ?
Aug 16 11:20:51 <xcoulon>	akazakov: ldimaggi_mtg ^^
Aug 16 11:20:58 <nboldt>	xcoulon: sure. looks like we have a topic for today's build.next call
Aug 16 11:21:41 <xcoulon>	nboldt: sure.. when is this call ? Do I need to join ?
Aug 16 11:21:59 <nboldt>	xcoulon: in 9 minutes, and yes, that would be helpful
Aug 16 11:22:15 <xcoulon>	nboldt:  can you forward the invite, please ? 
Aug 16 11:22:21 <nboldt>	xcoulon: http://jbds-pm.etherpad.corp.redhat.com/build-next-20160816
Aug 16 11:22:40 <xcoulon>	nboldt: thanks ! I'm out for 5min, I'll be back for the call
Aug 16 11:22:52 <nboldt>	xcoulon: ok
Aug 16 11:23:06 <ldimaggi_mtg>	xcoulon, nboldt Given that https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-23011 is both a regression and literally blocks the use of the feature, I don't think that we should release AM3 until this is fixed
Aug 16 11:25:20 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_mtg: you're killing me, DiMaggio.
Aug 16 11:25:54 <ldimaggi_mtg>	nboldt, sorry - trying to pay attention to this massive meeting in Westford
Aug 16 11:51:02 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I commented on the issue. We plan to include a message in the user to ask them to pull the nightly build to update the Docker Tooling, but I'm also concerned with this issue that I found today: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=499744 and I think we should also fix that one before we ask the users to update the bundles.
Aug 16 11:51:43 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I'm going to look at it right now
Aug 16 12:01:55 <nboldt>	xcoulon: rgrunber: will the docker tools nightly site have the fix by EOD today?
Aug 16 12:02:22 <xcoulon>	nboldt: I think so, yes.
Aug 16 12:02:28 <rgrunber>	yes.
Aug 16 12:02:59 <nboldt>	ok cool
Aug 16 12:03:09 <nboldt>	then when the blog goes out (tomorrow?) it'll be accurate
Aug 16 12:03:11 <xcoulon>	nboldt: but I found a bug this morning that I'd rather see fixed before asking the users to install the nightly build. I'm already working on it now
Aug 16 12:03:37 <nboldt>	xcoulon: bug in docker tooling or in openshift?
Aug 16 12:03:42 <xcoulon>	nboldt: yes, if blog goes out tomorrow it should be fine, the update site should be up-to-date.
Aug 16 12:03:47 <xcoulon>	nboldt: bug in Docker tooling
Aug 16 12:03:48 <nboldt>	sweet
Aug 16 12:03:53 <nboldt>	ok perfect
Aug 16 12:04:09 <xcoulon>	nboldt: I appreciate your sense of "perfect" ;-)
Aug 16 12:04:44 <nboldt>	perfect, for all values of "good enough"
Aug 16 12:04:47 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: what's the issue with bug 499744 ? looks like an issue with remote api output format...
Aug 16 12:05:34 <rgrunber>	media type=text/plain ? .. for Container messages i would think that should be application/json
Aug 16 12:05:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: damn'it, I commented on the wrong issue. Please ignore the "comment 1"
Aug 16 12:06:21 <rgrunber>	in fact i remember filing a bug ages ago for some remote api returns which specify a media type of text/plain.. which was clearly wrong.
Aug 16 12:06:22 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: but also, can you try to reproduce it ? I can't see the new connection in the Explorer view
Aug 16 12:06:39 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, me too. This was at the time of Docker 1.7
Aug 16 12:07:40 <rgrunber>	so it's related to version of docker daemon used.. possibly.
Aug 16 12:08:57 <xcoulon>	I would think so, but I commented there for another bug
Aug 16 12:09:03 <xcoulon>	which is on CDK
Aug 16 12:09:44 <xcoulon>	499744 is just about the Docker Explorer view not being refreshed, I think. But first I'm writing an SWT Bot test to retproduce it
Aug 16 12:09:53 <xcoulon>	s/retproduce/reproduce
Aug 16 12:10:50 <rgrunber>	ahhh ok i c now.. your comment #2 is not meant for that..
Aug 16 12:11:20 <rgrunber>	or no.. comment#1.. yeah.. 2nd thing in the bug
Aug 16 12:11:42 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, sorry for the confusion, I was commenting on the 499744 page for another bug
Aug 16 12:21:12 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: the functionality worked before https://git.eclipse.org/r/76610/ so i'd like at the explorer code from there.
Aug 16 12:21:22 <rgrunber>	in fact.. this looks pretty suspect : https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76610/8/containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/views/DockerExplorerView.java
Aug 16 12:21:38 <xcoulon>	jeez...
Aug 16 12:22:03 <xcoulon>	why did I do that ??
Aug 16 12:22:08 <xcoulon>	sigh...
Aug 16 12:22:10 <rgrunber>	testing?
Aug 16 12:23:41 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I'm not sure. I probably thought these lines where useless in my use-case… 
Aug 16 12:24:25 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: the good news is: I just wrote an SWTBot test that reproduced the problem and that verified that uncommenting the 3 lines actually resolves the problem
Aug 16 12:25:18 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: so now, let me run the whole suite of tests again and then I'll push to gerrit
Aug 16 12:25:37 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I won't touch my laptop for ~10min while the tests are running
Aug 16 12:29:36 <rgrunber>	k. you could also try creating some fake display (Xvnc/Xvfb) and then just pass the display # to the mvn call, or in the junit launch config.. i usually do that.. especiall because running the full linuxtools+tests takes a while. 
Aug 16 12:30:51 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to fuhbot2
Aug 16 12:36:07 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, I should try to see if it's doable on MacOSX
Aug 16 12:43:03 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I'm pushing the fix for 499744 on gerrit.
Aug 16 12:43:40 <xcoulon>	I just added you as a reviewer on it: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79147/
Aug 16 12:45:19 <rgrunber>	k
Aug 16 12:47:50 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: feel free to push https://git.eclipse.org/r/79130/ as well if you're fine with it.
Aug 16 12:48:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: ok, done ;-)
Aug 16 12:49:39 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: btw, I don't remember how/when the nightly update site is updated for the Docker tooling. Is it once a day, 3x a day or after each build ?
Aug 16 13:03:26 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: i'll have to trigger a build.. iirc it's only twice a day.
Aug 16 13:04:56 <rgrunber>	appears to be at 12pm or 6pm, if a change exists.
Aug 16 13:05:03 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: ok
Aug 16 13:15:17 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: ok, so build was successful and I merged the patch: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79147/
Aug 16 13:15:30 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: can you trigger a build for the Docker tooling ?
Aug 16 13:16:15 <rgrunber>	triggered.
Aug 16 13:16:21 <rgrunber>	https://hudson.eclipse.org/linuxtools/job/linuxtools-master/2574/
Aug 16 13:16:34 <rgrunber>	once it's done, content should be available under the updates-docker-nightly site.
Aug 16 13:19:50 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: awesome ! also, can I mark https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=499745 as fixed/resolved 
Aug 16 13:21:57 <rgrunber>	yeah.. we'd still need for reporter to confirm it's fixed for the windows one.
Aug 16 13:22:17 <xcoulon>	ok, so I'll leave it open and ask Martin to confirm it's fixed, then.
Aug 16 13:22:51 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I'm off for now.

Aug 22 12:27:26 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: also, I have serious internet connection issues here this week. Currently on tethering until a technician comes to see what's wrong with the network/cable. He's scheduled to come on Friday only :-(
Aug 22 12:30:46 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: FYI, I'm working on https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=499749 and I hope I can have a patch later tonight or tomorrow morning, too.

Aug 23 11:32:08 <akurtakov>	xcoulon: he should be at LinuxCon which is in toronto this week
Aug 23 11:33:09 <xcoulon>	akurtakov: oh, I thought he said he was not going. I guess I misunderstood, then
Aug 23 11:33:43 <akurtakov>	hmm, I don't know I see in the team calendar leo, roland and martha going 
Aug 23 11:34:06 <xcoulon>	akurtakov: ok, I have to disconnectnow, but I'll join the channel later today to try to reach him
Aug 23 11:34:09 <xcoulon>	akurtakov: thanks !

Aug 23 13:30:04 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff ! I just saw that you merged the patch to support Docker Compose ! Thanks a lot !
Aug 23 13:30:38 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: also, I'm seeing some changes on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79490/ but I'm not sure what you did on patch set 2
Aug 23 13:31:17 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: and finally, do you need any help from me tonight for the RC1 build ?
Aug 23 13:32:05 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: or maybe patchset 2 for https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79490/ was just a rebase on master after you merged the patch for Docker Compose ?
Aug 23 13:39:14 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: are you here ?
Aug 23 13:39:38 <xcoulon>	(ha, that might be lunch time for you..)
Aug 23 14:14:31 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: yes, I was at a late lunch...I had to rebase your other patch as it collided with your Docker Compose patch
Aug 23 14:15:06 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I shouldn't require any help from you this evening...if I have build issues, I may contact you tomorrow morning
Aug 23 14:18:08 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I am getting "No Docker image selected" for your hierarchy patch no matter whether I choose an image in Explorer or Images view...any ideas?
Aug 23 15:02:17 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to akurtakov
Aug 23 15:19:20 <nboldt1>	anyone know which jenkins slaves (if any) have mock and rpmbuild installed on them? 
Aug 23 15:24:25 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello again ! 
Aug 23 15:25:05 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: so, do you need any help for the RC1 build today/this evening ?
Aug 23 15:25:31 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: hi...I managed to check in your other patch, but you need to eventually clean up the UI...the hierarchy view says no image selected even though an image can be selected in Explorer or Images view....perhaps it should just be empty
Aug 23 15:25:39 <xcoulon>	(damn… even pulling mails via phone is a pain..)
Aug 23 15:25:59 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: s
Aug 23 15:26:15 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I shouldn't require any help this evening, but perhaps tomorrow if I run into a problem
Aug 23 15:26:51 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok for the build. I'm not sure I understant what you mean by "the hierarchy view says no image selected even though an image can be selected in Explorer or Images view"
Aug 23 15:27:58 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: if hierarchy view is open on startup, it contains a msg saying "no image has been selected"...this occurs even if you select an image in the Explorer or Images views...it only fills in if you right-click an image in Explorer view and select Open Hierarchy View
Aug 23 15:28:53 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ha ok. So not a blocker for the RC1 build, then ?
Aug 23 15:28:59 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: correct
Aug 23 15:29:21 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: but open a bug to track it...also add support to Images view context menu
Aug 23 15:29:44 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok, sure
Aug 23 15:32:12 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok so my connection is so slow that BZ does not even load the page to open new issues. I'll look at that tomorrow morning
Aug 23 15:32:26 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: ok
Aug 23 15:33:36 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: I'm off for this evening, then. I'll check my mails tomorrow morning to see if there's anything to do for the RC1 build
Aug 23 15:33:40 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: have a good afternoon/night
Aug 23 15:33:44 <jjohnstn>	you too
Aug 23 15:36:27 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: thanks ! Regarding the Image Hierarchy view message, what would you suggest ? I'm not sure we should support the link to the explorer view/images view/containers view selection. Should I just change the message to something more specific/less confusing ?
Aug 23 15:37:00 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I think leave it empty and don't open the view by default
Aug 23 15:37:15 <xcoulon>	(since BZ finally responded, I'm going to fill the issues now)
Aug 23 15:37:54 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: well, I'm just surprised that it was open by default. I'll need to check that. Maybe there's a setting in the plugin.xml that I copied from the Explorer view..
Aug 23 15:38:01 <xcoulon>	but I see what you mean
Aug 23 15:38:20 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: the workspace could have remembered it being open
Aug 23 15:39:40 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: yes, maybe. So I opened https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500159 . Feel free to comment ;-)
Aug 23 15:39:49 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: that's all for me now. Bye !
Aug 23 15:41:21 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: so RC1 bits are live some time tomorrow?
Aug 23 15:41:39 <nboldt1>	s/are/will be
Aug 23 15:46:23 <jjohnstn>	nboldt1: yes, tomorrow before 5 pm
Aug 23 15:50:47 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: great!

Aug 24 09:47:23 <scela>	mistria: hey
Aug 24 09:47:32 <mistria>	scela: hi!
Aug 24 09:47:34 <scela>	will you have time in the near future to push the example projects to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=499811
Aug 24 09:47:46 <scela>	i have some strange issue with the CLA-now ECA
Aug 24 09:51:11 <scela>	mistria: i think i fixed it. had to invalidate and sign again.
Aug 24 09:51:14 <scela>	so I'll do it myself
Aug 24 09:51:33 <mistria>	scela: so it was removed from the initial contribution, right?
Aug 24 09:51:34 <akurtakov>	scela: your counting is weird :)
Aug 24 09:51:44 <akurtakov>	two members - Dani, Alex and Lars :)
Aug 24 09:52:09 <scela>	akurtakov: yeah I forgot one and added it only in one place :)
Aug 24 09:52:24 <scela>	mistria: yes
Aug 24 09:52:40 <scela>	we need refactoring in bugzilla
Aug 24 09:52:52 <scela>	akurtakov: ^
Aug 24 09:54:39 <mistria>	scela: ok. I'm working on setting up a patch with examples as a child of current patch set 25
Aug 24 09:54:50 <mistria>	scela: in a separate commit/review
Aug 24 09:55:50 <mistria>	scela: by the way, I believe I've achieved a major step forward regarding language servers
Aug 24 09:56:09 <mistria>	scela: use can now define a LaunchConfiguration which is a language server and associate it with the content type of their choice
Aug 24 09:56:26 <mistria>	scela: so if you want to add support for a new language server, you can do it without installing anything
Aug 24 09:56:48 <scela>	mistria: nice
Aug 24 09:56:53 <scela>	is it in the github so I can try it?
Aug 24 09:56:58 <mistria>	is it only me or Gerrit isn't reachable via CLI/HTTP
Aug 24 09:57:03 <mistria>	yes, it's on GitHub
Aug 24 09:57:19 <mistria>	CLI/SSH sorry
Aug 24 09:57:43 <scela>	mistria: I'll give it a look
Aug 24 09:57:54 <scela>	mistria: I'm still stuck waiting on dani to review the patch
Aug 24 09:58:01 <scela>	to get the editor infrastructure in
Aug 24 09:58:21 <scela>	that would also be quite nice to have. hopefully we have it in M2.
Aug 24 09:58:47 <scela>	mistria: don't know about CLI on gerrit, i use only http
Aug 24 09:59:02 <mistria>	Gerrit is back for me
Aug 24 09:59:17 <mistria>	Yeah, I'm also frustrated to have to wait for Dani
Aug 24 09:59:28 <mistria>	but at least, he cares about it
Aug 24 09:59:31 <mistria>	that's a good thing ;)
Aug 24 09:59:47 <mistria>	it means he's going to really review it, one day
Aug 24 10:01:12 <scela>	mistria: once we have that part in it will 'release' us to focus on some consumption scenarios to feed to p.ui or p.text
Aug 24 10:01:55 <mistria>	scela: Dani told me that the .project editor would be sufficient to feed platform.whatever
Aug 24 10:02:30 <scela>	mistria: 'sufficient' to get it in. but it would be nice to have more in order to put it under lots of use case scenarios
Aug 24 10:02:44 <scela>	mistria: a. loskutov was pretty happy about it and he wanted more
Aug 24 10:02:50 <scela>	like .classpath editor etc.
Aug 24 10:07:22 <mistria>	scela: enjoy https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79630/
Aug 24 10:08:06 <mistria>	scela: doesn't JDT already contribute a correct editor for .classpath? Also, the Project Settings page is IMO perfect at doing it.
Aug 24 10:10:41 <scela>	mistria: no i don't think there is a .classpath textual editor
Aug 24 10:10:49 <scela>	they are usually opened in plain text
Aug 24 10:11:06 <scela>	mistria: yeah the settings are a way to do it, but that's also true for .project
Aug 24 10:11:16 <scela>	it's more an alternative way than a feature addition
Aug 24 10:12:24 <mistria>	scela: a project settings page would be perfect for .project too: http://eclip.se/102527
Aug 24 10:15:43 <scela>	mistria: the only thing lacking is the nature AFAICS
Aug 24 10:16:17 <akurtakov>	scela: mistria: if you look for real world test case for the editor stuff - ant editor is probably quite good for that purpose
Aug 24 10:16:31 <akurtakov>	plain editor reimplementing everything from scratch IIRC
Aug 24 10:16:47 <scela>	akurtakov: can the ant editor give me autocomplete on natures?
Aug 24 10:17:10 <mistria>	akurtakov: Ant sucks and is not much used at the moment; I don't think it would bring that much value
Aug 24 10:17:26 <mistria>	akurtakov: FYI, my current main editor for testing language server is a C# one
Aug 24 10:17:48 <mistria>	akurtakov: I have diagnostics, completion, hover, Find References, Open Declaration
Aug 24 10:17:55 <mistria>	akurtakov: working on Refactoring
Aug 24 10:18:16 <akurtakov>	mistria: I see, I was thinking for the case where you need a use case in platform itself and you can try way more things with the ant editor than with .project editor
Aug 24 10:18:38 <scela>	mistria: have you thought about whether we can contribute some of that C# stuff to some real eclipse project once the editor infra is in?
Aug 24 10:19:18 <mistria>	scela: the general binding with language servers can be contributed, it's only using Eclipse's API
Aug 24 10:20:10 <scela>	mistria: which project are you thinking of to contribute that part?
Aug 24 10:20:16 <mistria>	scela: For the C# part, we can ship a plugin that tries to detect some OmniSharp version and create the launch configuration and association, in an IStartup
Aug 24 10:20:45 <mistria>	scela: VSCode team people told me that soon, the dotnet SDK will ship a language server out of the box
Aug 24 10:20:51 <mistria>	scela: ie, no OmniSharp
Aug 24 10:21:24 <mistria>	scela: plain dotnet commands, that we can easily set up as launch configurations
Aug 24 10:21:33 <mistria>	scela: about a target project, I don't know
Aug 24 10:21:40 <mistria>	scela: Platform is IMO too low level.
Aug 24 10:21:51 <mistria>	scela: Maybe DLTK would be a good fit
Aug 24 10:21:56 <mistria>	scela: or create a new one...
Aug 24 10:22:07 <scela>	akurtakov: do you think DLTK is a fit? ^
Aug 24 10:22:41 <scela>	mistria: it's nice they'll make it easier. i wiped my packages twice trying to set up omnisharp on fedora
Aug 24 10:23:20 <akurtakov>	mistria: scela: could be, it was supposed to serve such usecases
Aug 24 10:23:45 <mistria>	akurtakov: nice!
Aug 24 10:23:54 <akurtakov>	with that said, I don't know what exactly do you want to contribute in eclipse land
Aug 24 10:24:25 <mistria>	akurtakov: as soon as the lsp4j project is provisioned at Eclipse.org and Platform intergrated the Generic editor, the language server support for Generic Editor can be moved to DLTK then
Aug 24 10:24:43 <mistria>	akurtakov: it's https://github.com/eclipselabs/eclipse-language-service
Aug 24 10:25:04 <akurtakov>	mistria: so basically that is hooking lsp4j in the generic editor?
Aug 24 10:25:09 <scela>	akurtakov: yes
Aug 24 10:25:19 <akurtakov>	sounds good
Aug 24 10:25:51 <scela>	akurtakov: generic editor can have any source, language servers are one. the code to bind to language servers will have to go to somewhere.
Aug 24 10:26:14 <scela>	by 'source' i mean source of information on coloring autocomplete etc. :)
Aug 24 10:35:30 <maxandersen>	mistria why would we not want the generic editor in eclipse platform ? 
Aug 24 10:36:05 <akurtakov>	maxandersen: not the generic editor but it's hook to language server
Aug 24 10:36:17 <mistria>	maxandersen: you misread some comments: generic editor in Platform, lsp-based extensions into DLTK
Aug 24 10:37:09 <maxandersen>	@akurtakov okey - as long as it does not require installing all the existing stuff in DLTK that can work. 
Aug 24 10:37:21 <maxandersen>	but where would i.e. json language server live ? 
Aug 24 10:37:29 <maxandersen>	language server based editor i mean.
Aug 24 10:37:35 <maxandersen>	would that be in WTP or DLTK ? 
Aug 24 10:37:40 <akurtakov>	that's entirely different question 
Aug 24 10:38:13 <maxandersen>	akurtakov okey, then I don't grok what is suggested to be in dltk ? 
Aug 24 10:38:15 <mistria>	maxandersen: specific "connections" or server would most likely go into WTP
Aug 24 10:38:40 <mistria>	maxandersen: the language server client for Eclipse Platform generic editor
Aug 24 10:38:48 <mistria>	maxandersen: which isn't language-specific
Aug 24 10:38:51 <maxandersen>	mistria okey, so WTP would need to depend on DLTK to get what it needs, mnot just platform ? 
Aug 24 10:39:10 <mistria>	maxandersen: if they want to pick the language server support, yes
Aug 24 10:39:26 <mistria>	maxandersen: there is IMO no way to have this language server support in Platform
Aug 24 10:39:27 <maxandersen>	ookey, so back to again - why not have that in the platform.
Aug 24 10:39:37 <mistria>	maxandersne: but maybe akurtakov have a different opinion
Aug 24 10:39:41 <maxandersen>	just like syntax highlghting is in the platform.
Aug 24 10:39:48 <maxandersen>	sourceviewerconfiguration
Aug 24 10:40:12 <mistria>	maxandersen: those don't depend on an external protocol or api, that's I believe what can make a difference
Aug 24 10:40:20 <maxandersen>	I honestly think if we put LPS stuff in higher level projects we'll not get the benefirts from it.
Aug 24 10:40:21 <akurtakov>	we wanted to create ide-commons for that sole purpose to hoste launchbar, remote, templates and eventually this one
Aug 24 10:40:27 <mistria>	maxandersen: but if platform is fine with keeping the LSP client, why not
Aug 24 10:40:27 <akurtakov>	but never got to it
Aug 24 10:41:00 <maxandersen>	akurtakov yes, which is why I was hopening putting it in platform would hav emore success ;)
Aug 24 10:41:01 <akurtakov>	I'm not convinced about lsp in platfrom yet
Aug 24 10:41:23 <akurtakov>	how much influence can community have over lsp?
Aug 24 10:41:41 <akurtakov>	is it 100% one company controlled?
Aug 24 10:41:53 <akurtakov>	as long as that's true I don't see it coming into platform
Aug 24 10:41:58 <mistria>	maxandersen akurtakov: I believe the API and release rules in Platform wouldn't fit for such a technology that's prone to evolve a lot
Aug 24 10:42:30 <akurtakov>	at least that's the PMC opinion from previous meetings
Aug 24 10:42:37 <mistria>	akurtakov maxandersen: could be in the e4.ui repository, that's where I've put all my mess lately ;)
Aug 24 10:44:02 <scela>	mistria: i'd rather not have it into an incubation-level project
Aug 24 10:44:10 <akurtakov>	being in e4.ui has the nasty incubation thing
Aug 24 10:44:41 <akurtakov>	which would prevent using it in e.g. linuxtools for the dockereditor or in dltk ruby and etc.
Aug 24 10:45:46 <mistria>	maybe just lsp4j would be fine
Aug 24 10:46:01 <mistria>	they'd have their plain API in one repo, and another repo for the Eclipse integration
Aug 24 10:46:22 <mistria>	after all, it's where this would make the more sense
Aug 24 10:46:41 <scela>	mistria: which repos do you mean in either case?
Aug 24 10:46:59 <mistria>	lsp4j.core, lsp4j.eclipse.ui
Aug 24 10:47:06 <mistria>	(imagining here)
Aug 24 10:48:01 <maxandersen>	mistria the platform needs to find a way to ship things that moves faster into the release train ;)
Aug 24 10:48:51 <akurtakov>	maxandersen: that has been also discussed multiple times - there is no issue with that other than no one to act on real releng tasks to make this happen
Aug 24 10:49:37 <akurtakov>	so we have the agreement this has to happen and all available resources at 150% at other tasks
Aug 24 10:50:17 <akurtakov>	so nothing happens
Aug 24 10:50:39 <akurtakov>	as it's more important keeping what we have now not breaking
Aug 24 10:52:21 <akurtakov>	maxandersen: I'm with you on that but if we want it to happen we have huge backlog to fight first
Aug 24 10:53:11 <akurtakov>	e.g. even for Neon we lifted the limit to what can be backported so Neon.1...n will be more important releases
Aug 24 10:53:26 <akurtakov>	but we face the issue of not having who to do the actual backports
Aug 24 10:53:45 <maxandersen>	agreed - if putting in platform is impossible then need to find another place to host it - DLTK for me just seem so foreign and seperated ;)
Aug 24 10:54:00 <maxandersen>	but if it could be done in DLTK similar to how docker tools was done in linux tools then great.
Aug 24 10:54:22 <maxandersen>	ie. docker was just put in linux tools so it could be released, but no actual connection to linux tools.
Aug 24 10:54:43 <akurtakov>	maxandersen: I really don't have preference over lsp4j and dltk 
Aug 24 10:55:05 <akurtakov>	if lsp4j folks are not fine with having it we should be able to sneak it into dltk so we can release it
Aug 24 10:55:37 <maxandersen>	you guys are aware gorkem is being asked by IBM to contribute the jdt-server implementation to JDT ...that will not use lsp4j anytime soon. 
Aug 24 10:55:40 <akurtakov>	maxandersen: it's not that it's important to put into platform it just requires more effort 
Aug 24 10:56:29 <maxandersen>	and he is working on a propsoal for that.
Aug 24 10:56:47 <akurtakov>	my impression was that lsp4j was more for client side implementation
Aug 24 10:57:22 <akurtakov>	when for server side you can implement protocol easier and faster without such abstractions
Aug 24 10:59:32 <akurtakov>	also lsp4j had this xtend/xtext dep, right? 
Aug 24 10:59:55 <akurtakov>	we already suffer from the emf/platform circular dep so adding one more is definetely bad idea
Aug 24 11:01:31 <akurtakov>	and again platform and jdt are built together (due to historical reasons) and breaking this circle requires effort
Aug 24 11:01:45 <akurtakov>	once this done - jdt could use way more deps 
Aug 24 11:02:48 <akurtakov>	everytime one adds such "innocent" small circle dep he/she slows the next iteration significantly
Aug 24 11:06:39 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to jjohnstn_
Aug 24 11:48:54 <maxandersen>	akurtakov yes, lsp4j has this dep and why I find it not useful for me ;)
Aug 24 12:31:05 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to ebaron
Aug 24 12:42:56 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff. Have you tried the support for creating a connection from environment variables in the clipboard ? It does not seem to work here and it breaks a test
Aug 24 12:43:24 <xcoulon>	do you know how it is supposed to work ? copy values from CLI and paste in the Docker Explorer view ?
Aug 24 12:44:23 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ha, never mind, I see it works from a runtime Eclipse. Now I need to figure out why the test fails
Aug 24 12:44:49 <jjohnstn|wfh>	xcoulon: I am at home and forgot to shut down my work IRC
Aug 24 12:45:01 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: oh, you're on PTO ?
Aug 24 12:45:09 <jjohnstn|wfh>	xcoulon: no, just working from home
Aug 24 12:45:15 <xcoulon>	ha ok
Aug 24 12:45:29 <xcoulon>	so I should ping you on jjohnstn|wfh. got it
Aug 24 12:45:38 <jjohnstn|wfh>	yup
Aug 24 12:46:07 <xcoulon>	anyway, I'll try to see why it fails here. In the mean time, I'll push a patch on gerrit to see if the build succeeds
Aug 24 12:46:07 <jjohnstn|wfh>	xcoulon: the build should be aggregated from last night...do we need to update a JIRA?
Aug 24 12:46:26 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn|wfh: if you can update them, please, yes
Aug 24 12:46:46 <xcoulon>	I'm still connecting via my phone, so can you do it ?
Aug 24 12:48:32 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn|wfh: so from my understanding, we're good for Neon.1.RC1, right ?
Aug 24 12:51:09 <jjohnstn|wfh>	I'll let nboldt know...the docker stuff is found at: http://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools/update-neon-1-docker-rc1
Aug 24 12:51:32 <jjohnstn|wfh>	xcoulon: yes
Aug 24 12:53:01 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn|wfh: great ! so I'll logoff for today. spend a bit of time with wife and kids as they just came back from 4 days away from home ;-)
Aug 24 12:53:11 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn|wfh: I'll see you tomorrow
Aug 24 12:53:13 <xcoulon>	bye
Aug 24 12:53:48 <jjohnstn|wfh>	xcoulon: enjoy
Aug 24 12:55:58 <xcoulon1>	jjohnstn|wfh: thanks ! have a good afternoon
Aug 24 12:59:37 <nboldt>	jjohnstn jjohnstn|wfh contents are live and ready for me to mirror into JBT TP?
Aug 24 13:00:19 <nboldt>	p2browser shows contents built last night ~10pm. 
Aug 24 13:01:00 <nboldt>	jjohnstn jjohnstn|wfh: so just wanted to confirm the site won't be updated later today as you'd said 5pm was the cutoff time and it's only 1pm now :D
Aug 24 14:05:42 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: I'm going to assume your silence = my assumption is correct and the site is complete and ready for use
Aug 24 14:43:55 <jjohnstn|wfh>	nboldt: yes, sorry, I was afk and forgot to denote it
Aug 24 14:47:24 <jjohnstn|wfh>	nboldt: yes, sorry, I was afk and forgot to denote it
Aug 24 15:06:21 <jjohnstn|wfh>	nboldt: to confirm...last night's build is the one I aggregated
Aug 24 15:07:52 <nboldt>	jjohnstn|wfh: thanks, I'm mirroring it now
Aug 24 15:09:17 <nboldt>	jjohnstn|wfh: do you forsee another update next week?
Aug 24 15:10:13 <jjohnstn|wfh>	nboldt: we are on a weekly rc1 schedule...next week is RC2, then a week later RC3, then finally a week after that RC4 which will become our Neon.1 5.1.0 release
Aug 24 15:10:21 <jjohnstn|wfh>	nboldt: so yet
Aug 24 15:10:25 <jjohnstn|wfh>	nboldt: so yes
Aug 24 15:10:33 <nboldt>	jjohnstn|wfh: ok, thanks

Aug 24 18:25:54 <strykerawb>	however i'm not seeing it available in public api

Aug 25 09:38:33 <xcoulon>	but it is in spotify client's MANIFEST.MF: org.bouncycastle.asn1.pkcs;version="
Aug 25 09:38:35 <xcoulon>	 [1.51,2)
Aug 25 09:38:56 <xcoulon>	and org.bouncycastle.openssl;version="[1.51,2)
Aug 25 09:39:46 <rgrunber>	docker.core doesn't depend on bouncycastle.
Aug 25 09:39:52 <rgrunber>	only docker-client
Aug 25 09:40:06 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, my bad. I was too quick
Aug 25 09:40:48 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I was afraid that we missed something on the Docker tooling side, but I suspect the problem that our colleague has is related to his TP
Aug 25 09:41:33 <rgrunber>	i'd have to look into it but according to what i wrote 1.51 has PEMParser and we certainly require it according to that through docker-client.
Aug 25 09:41:42 <rgrunber>	perhaps they're using an older docker-client, or something..
Aug 25 09:42:05 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, there seems to be something wrong somewhere
Aug 25 09:47:22 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: btw, docker.editor is still in version 1.0.0 and docker.doc is in version 2.0.0. Maybe we should align them with the others (2.1.0) ?

Aug 25 10:56:19 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: .. aren't you on pto today ?
Aug 25 10:56:31 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: tonight
Aug 25 10:56:45 <xcoulon>	until next Thursday (Sept 1st)
Aug 25 10:56:57 <rgrunber>	ah ok.

Aug 25 12:16:00 *	Now talking on #eclipse
Aug 25 12:16:00 *	Topic for #eclipse is: Eclipse discussions
Aug 25 12:16:00 *	Topic for #eclipse set by akurtakov!~akurtakov@vpn1-5-170.ams2.redhat.com (Tue May 17 08:53:56 2016)
Aug 25 12:16:01 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: what do you mean ?
Aug 25 12:16:25 <nboldt1>	why is the new bundle called "jdk15on" ?
Aug 25 12:16:39 <nboldt1>	was it compiled w/ JDK 1.5 instead of perhaps something newer ?
Aug 25 12:16:52 <nboldt1>	is it possible the class is not accessible to JDK 8?
Aug 25 12:17:03 <xcoulon>	O_O
Aug 25 12:17:13 *	nboldt1 is speculating wildly
Aug 25 12:17:32 <rgrunber>	i believe they're both the same jdk15on..  just the bsn that is different from when it was originally in orbit.
Aug 25 12:17:49 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I can't update my TP here because my phone is my modem, so rgrunber could you try that ?
Aug 25 12:18:16 <xcoulon>	try to create a connection in the Docker tooling when bouncycastle 1.52 is used
Aug 25 12:18:24 <nboldt1>	but in the docker tools RC1 site, the bundles don't have -jdk15on suffix in them
Aug 25 12:19:10 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: https://issues.jboss.org/secure/attachment/12408773/RC1vs0825N_sorted.txt (on the left is RC1 < and on the right is nightly >)
Aug 25 12:19:32 <nboldt1>	< org.bouncycastle.bcpkix [1.51.0.v201505131810] 
Aug 25 12:19:36 <nboldt1>	> org.bouncycastle.bcpkix-jdk15on [1.52.0.v20160323-2125] 
Aug 25 12:19:40 <nboldt1>	< org.bouncycastle.bcprov [1.51.0.v201505131810] 
Aug 25 12:19:41 <nboldt1>	> org.bouncycastle.bcprov-jdk15on [1.52.0.v20160323-2125]
Aug 25 12:19:55 <nboldt1>	so it's not QUITE the same :D
Aug 25 12:20:35 <rgrunber>	no but docker-client does an import-package so it wouldn't matter they both Export-Package the correct content.
Aug 25 12:23:04 <rgrunber>	i'll try out a connection against 1.52 to see since that'll pretty much decide it.
Aug 25 12:23:09 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: would you please review https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79638/
Aug 25 12:23:15 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: yeah, that's what I was expecting... though I'm really curious why the suffix is there and what it means
Aug 25 12:24:35 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: https://twitter.com/akurtakov/status/768736440398118912 pretty much gives you what to expect
Aug 25 12:24:35 <rgrunber>	but from my investigation i couldn't see any reason why the update from 1.51 to 1.52 would fail.. docker-client import packages to bouncycastle would still support 1.52 and the classes are in the same location so nothing like that should happen..
Aug 25 12:24:42 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: ah about the suffix..
Aug 25 12:24:51 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html
Aug 25 12:25:22 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: if you test the additional css file path too and please test I haven't broke 3.18 and older :)
Aug 25 12:25:52 <rgrunber>	15on -> JDK 1.5 and onward.
Aug 25 12:26:40 <nboldt1>	maybe they're not declared as singletons so both 1.51 and 1.52 are present in devstudio?
Aug 25 12:27:27 <akurtakov>	why should they be singletons?
Aug 25 12:27:30 <rgrunber>	they probably wouldn't be singletons.. as libraries
Aug 25 12:28:05 <rgrunber>	yeah.. so if the same classloader tried to load 2 different ones.. that could cause it..
Aug 25 12:32:09 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: can you comment on https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-23043 ?
Aug 25 12:32:27 <xcoulon>	I have to go for errands but I should be back after dinner (in 2-3hrs)
Aug 25 12:32:48 <rgrunber>	k i'll try and see what's wrong.
Aug 25 12:35:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok

Aug 25 12:39:40 <mbenitez>	mbooth, do you have access to BZ1367019 ?
Aug 25 12:42:56 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks
Aug 25 12:43:00 <xcoulon>	see you later
Aug 25 12:47:28 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I think so
Aug 25 12:48:02 <mbenitez>	I can't access that or a few others in Martin's testing results
Aug 25 12:48:37 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Oh, maybe I see the problem "Groups: Red Hat Quality Assurance (internal)"
Aug 25 12:49:06 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Try now
Aug 25 12:49:07 <mbenitez>	mbooth, that sounds promising
Aug 25 12:49:50 <lufimtse>	mbooth, what was the link to the Trello board again?
Aug 25 12:49:54 <mbenitez>	mbooth, you got it! it works now, can I ask you to please change a few more? since you have QA rights :)
Aug 25 12:50:03 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Sure
Aug 25 12:50:16 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Although, I expected you to have more rights than me!
Aug 25 12:50:44 <mbooth>	lufimtse: This is the board I was looking at: https://trello.com/b/yugU3B6P/team-code
Aug 25 12:51:34 <mbenitez>	mbooth, maybe as component owner you are more trustworthy than me :) if you can: 1367354 1367471 1367667
Aug 25 12:53:07 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I fixed the last two, but even I am not authorised for 1367354 :-(
Aug 25 12:57:09 <mbenitez>	mbooth, thanks! I'll ask vkadlcik_gone tomorrow
Aug 25 12:58:11 *	fuhbot2 gives channel operator status to ebaron
Aug 25 13:27:37 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: mbooth: what's a good way to test whether the rh-eclipse46-devstudio rpm works as expected? I can launch it but ... then what? Asking because I have two versions of it now - one is 300M and one is bloated up to 460M
Aug 25 13:28:11 <nboldt1>	hope the smaller one works just as well as the big one since difference is duplicate IUs already installed via RPMs (eclipse-* packages)
Aug 25 13:28:19 <nboldt1>	ldimaggi: ^ same question for you
Aug 25 13:28:23 <mbooth>	nboldt1: I guess you can see if all your bundles are loaded?
Aug 25 13:29:00 <nboldt1>	you mean osgi console?
Aug 25 13:29:04 <mbooth>	Sure
Aug 25 13:29:22 <mbooth>	I mean, I don't know what devstudio includes, so I can't say if there are missing perspectives, menus, etc
Aug 25 13:30:07 <nboldt1>	mbooth: fair enough ... that's why I'm asking. I don't have a good "smoke test" other than "does it start and can I see Central / install stuff from there" which I use for staging & releasing builds
Aug 25 13:30:13 <ldimaggi>	nboldt1, what is in the extra 160MB? any ideas?
Aug 25 13:30:43 <nboldt1>	ldimaggi: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-3981?focusedCommentId=13283931&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13283931
Aug 25 13:30:58 <nboldt1>	yes, I know exactly what the 160M are. See attachmetns on the jira ;)
Aug 25 13:31:13 <mbooth>	nboldt1: I usually check to see there are no bundles in the "INSTALLED" state (that could not be resolved)
Aug 25 13:31:51 <nboldt1>	mbooth: I haven't used osgi console in AGES. can you pastebin me some commands you use to do that?
Aug 25 13:32:04 <mbooth>	ss -s INSTALLED
Aug 25 13:32:07 <nboldt1>	other than `./eclipse -console -consolelog -debug`
Aug 25 13:32:12 <nboldt1>	I see
Aug 25 13:35:24 <nboldt1>	mbooth: hmm. not sure if the RPM actually installs anything. When I launch /usr/bin/eclipse I only see Eclipse + EMF installed :(
Aug 25 13:36:10 <mbooth>	/usr/bin/eclipse ... ?
Aug 25 13:36:24 <nboldt1>	yes, isn't that where the rh-eclipse36-base is installed?
Aug 25 13:36:27 <nboldt1>	46*
Aug 25 13:36:33 <mbooth>	No
Aug 25 13:36:37 <nboldt1>	ah
Aug 25 13:36:42 <nboldt1>	so... then... where?
Aug 25 13:36:52 <rgrunber>	 /opt
Aug 25 13:36:59 <mbooth>	You can use the launcher from the gnome menu
Aug 25 13:37:07 <mbooth>	Or from the command line:
Aug 25 13:37:17 <mbooth>	scl enable rh-eclipse46 eclipse
Aug 25 13:37:30 <mbooth>	IIRC
Aug 25 13:38:59 <mbooth>	What rgrunber says
Aug 25 13:39:18 <rgrunber>	mbooth: executing '/opt' won't do much :P
Aug 25 13:39:31 <mbooth>	I mean for location :-p
Aug 25 13:39:36 <mbooth>	scl enable rh-eclipse46 'which eclipse' might do it
Aug 25 13:39:50 <nboldt1>	yeah, I looked in there and found a whole ./root/subtree/madness
Aug 25 13:40:05 <rgrunber>	but yeah it's in /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/lib64/eclipse/
Aug 25 13:40:37 <rgrunber>	the scl stuff just sets things like PATH and other env needed to resolve things nicely
Aug 25 13:40:53 <nboldt1>	so... that last one worked
Aug 25 13:40:57 <rgrunber>	if you need to test things from cli, really useful to do something like 'scl enable rh-eclipse46 bash', then go from there.
Aug 25 13:41:00 <nboldt1>	scl enable rh-eclipse46 `which eclipse` 
Aug 25 13:41:36 <nboldt1>	but the eclipse that's launched only has RCP, platform, help, and emf.{ecore,common}
Aug 25 13:41:52 <nboldt1>	that's pretty BASE. why no devstudio, I wonder
Aug 25 13:42:44 <nboldt1>	should I be building this in another scl thing?
Aug 25 13:42:53 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Try what rgrunber suggests, do "scl enable rh-eclipse46 bash" and then launch "eclipse" from there
Aug 25 13:42:55 <nboldt1>	eg., not rh-eclipse46 but rh-eclipse46-devstudio?
Aug 25 13:43:06 <mbooth>	The SCL needs to be enabled when you launch it
Aug 25 13:43:32 <mbooth>	The gnome launcher hides this from you
Aug 25 13:45:17 <nboldt1>	/opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/lib64/eclipse/plugins contains no devstudio. also not in droplets, dropins, etc.
Aug 25 13:45:53 <nboldt1>	so... I feel like my build script is producing something that yum/dnf/rpm is not installing correctly
Aug 25 13:45:59 <nboldt1>	mbooth: rgrunber: ^
Aug 25 13:46:57 <rgrunber>	if you're installing an rpm, does rpm -ql $rpm say anything about where the contents are ?
Aug 25 13:48:05 <nboldt1>	/opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/eclipse/droplets/devstudio/...
Aug 25 13:48:34 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Hmm, and those dirs/files listed do not exist on disk?
Aug 25 13:48:42 <nboldt1>	it does. yes
Aug 25 13:49:07 <nboldt1>	 but /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/lib64/eclipse/ is not the same as /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/eclipse/
Aug 25 13:50:39 <mbooth>	Oh I see, usr/share is used for architecture independent droplets, usr/lib64 for dropins that contain architecture-specific bits
Aug 25 13:50:56 <mbooth>	s/dropins/droplets/
Aug 25 13:51:34 <mbooth>	So it seems installed correctly then
Aug 25 13:51:49 <nboldt1>	then why don't I see any of that when I fire up eclipse?
Aug 25 13:52:24 <mbooth>	nboldt1: I am just downloading your rpm from the jira ticket to see, is that correct rpm to test?
Aug 25 13:52:35 <nboldt1>	which one? there are 2 linked there
Aug 25 13:52:49 <mbooth>	Latest: http://wonka.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/RHDS/10.0/snapshots/builds/20160824-2319/
Aug 25 13:52:58 <nboldt1>	that's the bigger one at 460M
Aug 25 13:53:07 <nboldt1>	I'm hoping the 300M one will work too
Aug 25 13:53:18 <nboldt1>	http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.rpm_master/20160824-2110/ << from there
Aug 25 13:57:16 <mbooth>	nboldt1, rgrunber: Okay I will go for dinner while this downloads, if no-one has any ideas when I get back I will investigate further :-)
Aug 25 13:57:39 <rgrunber>	nearly done downloading.. 20s.
Aug 25 13:57:40 <nboldt1>	mbooth: all I get is the splash screen but it doesn't seem it's ever going to start
Aug 25 13:58:36 <mbooth>	rgrunber: You win the chance to investigate then, I think VPN is a bottleneck for me
Aug 25 13:58:40 <mbooth>	;-)
Aug 25 13:58:53 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: what version of 'eclipse-platform'
Aug 25 13:59:43 <nboldt1>	Installed Packages
Aug 25 13:59:43 <nboldt1>	Name        : eclipse-platform

Aug 25 13:59:44 <nboldt1>	Release     : 3.fc24
Aug 25 14:04:27 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: could you try against http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=793168 ?
Aug 25 14:04:41 <rgrunber>	i'llbe pushing that to bodhi very soon.
Aug 25 14:05:10 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: how do I make dnf find that version?
Aug 25 14:08:09 <rgrunber>	they're not in any repo even that koji would have so you'll have to manually download those.
Aug 25 14:14:55 <nboldt1>	all of them? ugh. 
Aug 25 14:15:05 <nboldt1>	anyway, after a few mins devstudio DID start up
Aug 25 14:15:14 <nboldt1>	rather, Eclipse started and it includes devstudio features
Aug 25 14:15:23 <nboldt1>	but I've found like 4 other problems :D
Aug 25 14:15:45 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: which ones ?
Aug 25 14:16:07 <nboldt1>	I'll open JIRAs
Aug 25 14:16:12 <nboldt1>	with screenshots n' shit
Aug 25 14:16:38 <rgrunber>	can you try -6 just to confirm they aren't solved by that ? are they only UI problems ?
Aug 25 14:30:18 <nboldt1>	they don't look like UI problems
Aug 25 14:30:28 <nboldt1>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-3982 contains 3 new subtasks, rgrunber

Aug 25 14:31:45 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: do you at least have a bash script to scrape the koji page for rpm links, and curl them all ?
Aug 25 14:48:39 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: there's 'koji download-build $buildid'
Aug 25 14:49:09 <rgrunber>	ughh one sec.

Aug 25 15:40:17 <xcoulon>	I see that you just merged https://git.eclipse.org/r/79650 ?
Aug 25 15:40:30 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: you mean JIRAs? I have

Aug 25 15:41:23 <xcoulon>	it's in another patch: 
Aug 25 15:41:30 <xcoulon>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/79699
Aug 25 15:41:44 <xcoulon>	that one you can review and merge as well
Aug 25 15:41:54 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: ok

Aug 25 15:42:15 <xcoulon>	s/greatm/great
Aug 25 15:42:42 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: anyway, if you can rebase any patches, it makes life easier for me to review
Aug 25 15:43:32 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: sure ! let me do that. Wasn't it the case for the one you just reviewed ? 
Aug 25 15:43:52 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: no, it applied cleanly
Aug 25 15:44:02 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok, cool
Aug 25 15:44:50 <xcoulon>	btw, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500298 should be fixed with one of today's patches
Aug 25 15:49:52 <xcoulon>	mmh, not sure…
Aug 25 16:35:17 <xcoulon1>	jjohnstn: I just pushed an update of the patch for BZ 500158
Aug 25 16:35:50 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon1: ok, thx
Aug 25 16:39:53 <xcoulon1>	jjohnstn: did you need my review on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79768/ or is it just a cherry-pick from my patch to apply on stable-5.1 ?
Aug 25 16:40:35 <jjohnstn>	it is a cherry pick
Aug 25 16:40:48 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon1: ^
Aug 25 16:52:40 <xcoulon1>	jjohnstn: ok, great

Aug 26 11:04:12 <mbenitez>	lufimtse, thank you for receiving the remaining stuff from the conference!
Aug 26 11:06:17 <lufimtse>	^.^, well, I actually stepped out for a bit to pay rent for the apartment I'm moving in to, but it made it here never the less.
Aug 26 11:30:20 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to mbenitez
Aug 26 11:36:13 <mbenitez>	lufimtse, give trello another try now
Aug 26 11:38:37 <lufimtse>	kk

Aug 26 11:42:33 <lufimtse>	mbenitez, that worked. I added a card for the webkit port.
Aug 26 11:42:45 <lufimtse>	Will post comments as I make progress.
Aug 26 11:43:08 <mbenitez>	lufimtse, good, and thanks for getting this started
Aug 26 15:03:55 <mbenitez>	nboldt, nice progress on the rpm, it's encouraging to see the changes
Aug 26 15:17:46 <nboldt>	mbenitez: thanks

Aug 29 09:37:52 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: can't you regenerate the mac/win files oyurself?
Aug 29 09:38:12 <akurtakov_>	if you use .classpath_win32/cocoa and rebuild?
Aug 29 09:45:29 <lufimtse>	hmm
Aug 29 09:45:39 <lufimtse>	I could probably
Aug 29 09:45:43 <lufimtse>	never thought of it
Aug 29 09:45:46 <lufimtse>	let me try
Aug 29 09:53:12 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to patrickm
Aug 29 10:02:47 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, can't seem to get it to work. When using .classpath_cocoa, swt just throws lots of errors in my face and changes to OS.java on mac side don't seem to get the desired effect. Have you ever got it to work?
Aug 29 10:03:05 <akurtakov_>	never tried 
Aug 29 10:03:12 <akurtakov_>	just thought it should work :)
Aug 29 10:03:24 <lufimtse>	X-D
Aug 29 10:04:07 <lufimtse>	I could boot into my OS X os, (I still have OS X installed as fallback) and re-compile there, but I figured it might be easier for someone with Cocoa dev experience to refresh bindings.

Aug 29 12:37:07 <rgrunber>	akazakov: could you add jjohnstn@redhat.com to the developer group on trello ? (noticed you have admin perms on it)
Aug 29 12:44:42 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, just added him to the board, we'll need somebody with permissions to add Jeff and others as official team members
Aug 29 12:45:45 <rgrunber>	ah good call, seems any member can add someone to the board.. just the team needs probably admin or something.
Aug 29 12:47:48 <mbenitez>	exactly
Aug 29 16:34:18 <lufimtse>	@anyone: In eclipse, some folders can be marked as derived, so that they don't show up in searches. Is there a way to see all folders that you marked as derived?
Aug 30 09:56:56 <mbenitez>	lufimtse, we replied to Eric almost a t the same time :D
Aug 30 10:05:36 <lufimtse>	:-D
Aug 30 10:40:33 <mbenitez>	ipun, you should be able to access the trello board now
Aug 30 10:41:55 <ipun>	mbenitez: in now, thanks!
Aug 30 10:42:05 <mbenitez>	good, np!
Aug 30 12:03:48 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: on track for a release of Docker Tooling RC2 on/before tomorrow @ noon?
Aug 30 12:24:03 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: should be
Aug 30 12:27:36 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: great, thanks
Aug 30 16:20:10 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: running into problem running gerrit due to being unable to load the launchbar-master repo in linuxtools-e4.6.target...any ideas?
Aug 30 16:39:01 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: is gerrit hanging ?
Aug 30 16:39:31 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: no, it fails...now I am having trouble just connecting to hudson.eclipse.org via browser
Aug 30 16:43:55 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: browser is ok now
Aug 30 16:44:19 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: also about the e-mail, i'm not sure where those are coming from.. even the latest I-build from Orbit doesn't include jackson 2.6.0.
Aug 30 16:45:10 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: gerrit keeps getting no route to host for https://hudson.eclipse.org
Aug 30 16:45:52 <rgrunber>	yeah i would restar the build.. it failed with No route to host...
Aug 30 16:47:15 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I have restarted multiple times and still the same error
Aug 30 16:47:54 <rgrunber>	ah.. well https://hudson.eclipse.org/ definitely seems down to me.
Aug 30 16:48:20 <rgrunber>	even though the service itself is up
Aug 30 17:00:49 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: the 2.6.0 stuff is coming from the downloads/apitools/linuxtools-2.0.0.zip which is owned by you...any ideas?
Aug 30 17:04:39 <rgrunber>	ah linuxtools-docker-2.0.0.zip
Aug 30 17:05:40 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: can we remove it?
Aug 30 17:05:46 <rgrunber>	nothing in apitools is being shipped.. can we just get rid of them for now?... yeah..
Aug 30 17:07:16 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I can't remove it...it is owned by you with no group privileges
Aug 30 17:07:23 <rgrunber>	we will need uses-cqs for bounycastle 1.52.. unless i just patch linuxtools to use the older one
Aug 30 17:08:07 <rgrunber>	k i'll remove it then.
Aug 30 17:08:37 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: thx...regarding bouncycastle...your pick...I suggest opening the CQ...do you need me to do it?
Aug 30 17:09:37 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: if you can go ahead. it's only needed for bcprov and bcpkix.
Aug 30 17:13:37 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: k the file should be gone.
Aug 30 17:13:51 <jjohnstn>	ok, thx
Aug 30 17:16:14 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: oh and swtchart.. hmm
Aug 30 17:18:13 <rgrunber>	swtchart 0.10.0 is in Orbit now.. my guess is we grab it because our deps only specify a lower limit.
Aug 30 17:18:37 <rgrunber>	it's brough in by tracecompass not us but out target platform picks it up.
Aug 30 17:26:49 <jjohnstn>	I have opened USE CQs for bcprov, bcpkix, and swtchart
Aug 30 17:27:01 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: ^
Aug 30 17:32:18 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: 5.1.0 is based off of the stable-5.0 branch right ?
Aug 30 17:32:35 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: no, stable-5.1 branch
Aug 30 17:32:42 <rgrunber>	ah yes, that one.
Aug 30 17:34:35 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I can't even get to linuxtools dashboard anymore and no response on the mailing list or from emo
Aug 30 17:35:43 <rgrunber>	yeah good call on the explanation.. i couldn't understand why they're flagging bcprov, bcpkix, slf4j.api when those are only for oxygen.
Aug 30 17:35:58 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: we have some issues with our build...Hudson is not working...gerrit can't connect to one of the repos we access...I can't guarantee we will be ready by noon anymore
Aug 30 17:36:34 <rgrunber>	so slf4j.api is another but afaict only the nighlies pull from the Orbit I-build
Aug 30 17:37:25 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: do I need to do an slf4j.api CQ?
Aug 30 17:37:46 <rgrunber>	you would for oxygen, but that isn't going into Neon.1
Aug 30 17:48:56 <rgrunber>	welp.. apparently Doug says Marketplace is down too..
Aug 30 19:11:29 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: awesome. OK, thx for the heads up
Aug 31 10:34:08 <scela>	mbenitez: will this telephony problem going around impact our ability to hold the meeting?
Aug 31 10:34:40 <rgrunber>	hmm not if we do a pure bjn and skip phones..
Aug 31 10:34:57 <mbenitez>	scela, if you use the polycom phone yes, but bluejeans seems to be working
Aug 31 10:35:16 <scela>	mbenitez: i don't have polycom but i had the feeling you use them in the conference room
Aug 31 10:35:21 <rgrunber>	i prefer to dial in with the phone and use laptop only for video but we could try all from laptop.
Aug 31 10:35:28 <mbenitez>	what Roland says may be the only issue, we may have to use only computers
Aug 31 10:35:39 <scela>	also mbooth usually joins by phone
Aug 31 10:35:57 <mbenitez>	scela, we'll figure it out, we have a few laptops around to get around this
Aug 31 10:36:24 <rgrunber>	but it may be only the office phone networks affected.. the bjn call service infrastructure is on the blujeans side right ?
Aug 31 10:36:53 *	rgrunber dials 
Aug 31 10:36:55 <scela>	mbenitez: ok, just wanted to bring it up so we don't waste time while we're there
Aug 31 10:37:09 <mbenitez>	scela, thank you
Aug 31 10:38:47 <rgrunber>	fwiw the 1-888 dial-in code works so i expect the european one to as well.
Aug 31 10:38:53 <rgrunber>	(off my cell)
Aug 31 10:41:15 <mbooth>	Huh, I was wondering why my phone was displaying a danger sign...
Aug 31 10:41:46 <akurtakov>	wait am I late for the call?
Aug 31 10:41:52 <akurtakov>	it should bne in 20 mins, right?
Aug 31 10:42:03 <scela>	akurtakov: yep
Aug 31 10:42:12 <akurtakov>	ok
Aug 31 10:42:12 <scela>	that's exactly why i brought it up now :)
Aug 31 10:42:23 <rgrunber>	mbooth: oh crap.. you use the actual polycom ones..
Aug 31 10:42:40 <rgrunber>	ie.. on the network or something..
Aug 31 10:42:49 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I will have to slum it and use the laptop mic
Aug 31 10:42:51 <scela>	rgrunber: that's voip no?
Aug 31 10:43:13 <rgrunber>	mbooth: do you have some toll-free dial-in for bjn in your area ?
Aug 31 10:43:39 <mbenitez>	I should have the info around
Aug 31 10:44:13 <mbenitez>	you can try 08006948057 (UK)
Aug 31 10:44:42 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Maybe, but in the hierarchy of call quality, PSTN is right at the bottom
Aug 31 10:46:53 <mbenitez>	https://bluejeans.com/numbers
Aug 31 10:56:22 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: did you get my note regarding RC2 being built..docker stuff is at http://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools/update-neon-1-docker-rc2
Aug 31 10:56:35 <nboldt>	yes, jjohnstn. Will start the mirror shortly
Aug 31 10:56:38 <nboldt>	thanks!

Sep 01 08:49:05 <mbenitez>	mbooth, thank you for looking at the openshift account, I'll fwd your note to Carl, he may be able to help us get the account we need
Sep 01 10:26:37 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: who would I bug / where would I report the problem that webtools-javaee droplet has an old version of javax.servlet?
Sep 01 10:27:16 <rgrunber>	in rh-eclipse46 ?.. a rebuild might solve it.. /me looks
Sep 01 10:27:45 <nboldt1>	similarly, need to know who to bug / where to report problem where linuxtools-docker droplet has javax.ws.rs.api 2.0.99 but devstudio has javax.ws.rs 2.0.1
Sep 01 10:28:26 <nboldt1>	for the moment I'm removing bundles that conflict due to singleton (ie., two plugins that expose the same packages, but are singletons)
Sep 01 10:28:56 <nboldt1>	but thought maybe this should be solved in upstream from rh-eclipse46-devstudio (eg., in eclipse-* or rh-eclipse46-* packages)
Sep 01 10:30:28 <rgrunber>	/opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/eclipse/droplets/linuxtools-docker/eclipse/plugins/javax.ws.rs-api_2.0.99.b01.jar -> /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/java/glassfish-jax-rs-api.jar , which is from rh-eclipse46-glassfish-jax-rs-api-2.0.1-3.1.el7.noarch
Sep 01 10:31:11 <rgrunber>	Bundle-Version: 2.0.99.b01 but it's versioned as 2.0.1 .. i seem to remember this issue.
Sep 01 10:32:56 <rgrunber>	my guess is the content is likely the same.. just a matter of who decided to version it as 2.0.99.. i know in Orbit it's 2.0.1.
Sep 01 10:45:29 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: and yeah webtools-javaee is still using tomcat-servlet's 3.0 api
Sep 01 10:45:47 <rgrunber>	hmm i wonder if it's the same in fedora and upstream..
Sep 01 10:49:27 <rgrunber>	hmm in fedora we use glassfish-servlet-api (3.1) and in rh-eclipse46 its tomcat's.. might be a packaging bug on our end.
Sep 01 10:49:31 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: ^
Sep 01 10:50:40 <rgrunber>	yeah http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/rpms/eclipse-webtools/tree/eclipse-webtools.spec?h=rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7#n401 indicates we intend to use glassfish.. weird.. i'll look some more.
Sep 01 10:58:56 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: well here's why it's familiar : https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1227529
Sep 01 11:56:39 <xcoulon>	@rgrunber @jjohnstn hello ! I'm having test failures on the Gcov component of Linux Tools while verifying a patch for Docker tooling on hudson: https://hudson.eclipse.org/linuxtools/job/linuxtools-gerrit/11167/ (This is the 3rd time in a row that the build fails for the same reason). Any idea what I need to do to fix that or who I should ping ? 
Sep 01 11:57:38 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I am seeing the same error...no idea why it is cropping up now...will have to look into it...I am doing a retrigger and hoping it is a random error
Sep 01 11:58:43 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: well, I was also thinking about a random error but since I got it 3 times in a row, I stopped hoping
Sep 01 12:00:17 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: there haven't been any gcov changes since I did the RC2 build so I don't know why it is occurring...perhaps something has changed in the platform
Sep 01 12:02:10 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: argh. So we need to ask the developer(s) in charge of gcov to verify and update the tests against RC2, then
Sep 01 12:02:49 <akurtakov>	nboldt1: mbooth + bug against eclipse scl so we can get all the acks
Sep 01 12:03:22 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I don't think so...I also had a run last night against master and it succeeded...I don't think it is gcov...I think it is the Hudson environment some how or a timing issue
Sep 01 12:04:30 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ha ok
Sep 01 12:04:43 <akurtakov>	jjohnstn: xcoulon: note that yesterday hudson builder(at least one of them) was updated from sles 11 to sles 12
Sep 01 12:05:02 <xcoulon>	akurtakov: "sles" ?
Sep 01 12:05:22 <akurtakov>	SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
Sep 01 12:06:10 <akurtakov>	so it's a major change of the whole hudson environment when looked from gcc POV
Sep 01 12:12:35 <akurtakov>	jjohnstn:  my guess would be either some tweaks to the tests needed or some package missing on that builder now
Sep 01 12:13:27 <ericwill>	akurtakov which version of GTK is that for SLES 12? 3.10?
Sep 01 12:27:01 <xcoulon>	akurtakov: ha ok, I see. Indeed, that may be the reason for the test failures. (sorry for the delayed response, I was on a call)
Sep 01 12:34:13 <jjohnstn>	ericwill: is there some form of work-around we can do?
Sep 01 13:23:13 <ericwill>	jjohnstn workaround for?
Sep 01 13:23:24 <ericwill>	Gcov failures?
Sep 01 13:35:31 <jjohnstn>	ericwill: for any bugs introduced by 3.10 or is just that the test-case is flawed and 3.10 exhibits them
Sep 01 13:38:17 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: having an issue with loading e4.6 target...I get stalled at 25% (over 30 minutes so far) and the following console msg:
Sep 01 13:38:36 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: Artifact repository out of sync. Overwriting /home/jjohnstn/workspace-neon-devel/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/.bundle_pool/plugins/org.bouncycastle.bcprov-jdk15on_1.52.0.v20160323-2125.jar
Sep 01 13:45:59 <ericwill>	jjohnstn I was asking out of curiosity, I doubt the problems are related to GTK
Sep 01 14:02:41 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: there's a newer version of bcprov in a newer I-build for linuxtools.
Sep 01 14:03:30 <rgrunber>	the target platform pde stuff has always been a little buggy.. i would try re-generating it.
Sep 01 14:06:36 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i like your thinking :P and have nothing against the balance of members being in Europe :P
Sep 01 14:53:48 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I can't get it to regenerate...any suggestions?  It stalls computing prerequisite plan
Sep 01 14:54:52 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: can you try bumping the sequence number in the target file ? then try the same thing (i usually try reloading, or i unselect the target platform, and then reslect it)
Sep 01 14:55:32 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: ok, I have already tried reloading and unselecting the target platform
Sep 01 14:58:54 <nboldt>	rgrunber: so looking at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1227529 I see why we have the disconnect in versions but ... well, I guess I still need to remove/blacklist some plugins that are already installed
Sep 01 15:37:16 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: could not get it working so had to switch to new workspace
Sep 01 15:39:13 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: that should work for usre. though i'm pretty sure bumping the target platform sequence number in the file shuld also work.
Sep 01 15:39:37 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: it did not for me
Sep 02 09:01:32 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: will join the call in 1min
Sep 02 09:01:36 <rgrunber>	k
Sep 02 10:25:38 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I posted a sample patch at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/80308/1 as per instructions in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2276271/how-to-make-mock-to-void-methods-with-mockito
Sep 02 10:28:45 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok, let me try it now, then
Sep 02 10:29:09 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: thx
Sep 02 10:34:15 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: so you want to change the status in the MockContainerStatus when the container is restarted, right ?
Sep 02 10:45:59 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: so the tests will pass if you use this: 
Sep 02 10:45:59 <xcoulon>	.when(this.dockerClient).restartContainer(Matchers.anyString(), Matchers.anyInt());
Sep 02 10:46:49 <xcoulon>	unfortunately, Mockito does not accept the Matchers.eq() methods as args in the 'restartContainer()' method call.
Sep 02 10:55:31 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: ok, thx
Sep 02 11:19:49 <ipun>	is anyone haviong trouble with hudson building slow right now? My build started 25 minutes ago and its still not done
Sep 02 11:23:26 <jjohnstn>	ipun: not running gerrit right now, but take a look at the console log...if it doesn't move after a significant period of time, the job may be stalled and you will have to retrigger/rebuild...otherwise, just wait
Sep 02 11:24:43 <ipun>	jjohnstn it looks like it just finished, mustve been something bogging it down
Sep 02 11:25:50 <jjohnstn>	ipun: could be Hudson is being taxed today...there is a platform build due today
Sep 02 11:29:26 <ipun>	gotcha, thanks for letting me know

Sep 02 12:30:34 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn|afk: all my 3 patches built successfully on Gerrit/Hudson. You should have received notifications for the review, if you have time for that before RC3
Sep 02 15:44:19 <jjohnstn|afk>	rgrunber: I'm getting an abort error running oprofile with epp-cpp RC2...opreport process error output: warning: /no-vmlinux could not be found.
Sep 02 15:44:35 <jjohnstn|afk>	rgrunber: is this just AERI being overly sensitive to the word error as it is only a warning?
Sep 02 15:46:06 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn|afk: i think so.. i'm guessing it's logged in the error log and aeri picks it up.

Sep 06 03:21:10 <mistria>	scela: ah yeah, I didn't look carefully
Sep 06 03:21:29 <mistria>	scela: I just parsed the file names and didn't even look at the manifest...
Sep 06 03:21:36 <mistria>	scela: feel free to bash me on the bug :)
Sep 06 03:22:05 <scela>	mistria: no, I'll save the credit for when I make some similar thing :)
Sep 06 03:22:39 <mistria>	scela: hope I'll remember about it!
Sep 06 03:22:40 <scela>	mistria: i figured it's too much trouble ATM to get rid of it for the profit

Sep 06 03:23:17 <mistria>	scela: Activators are cool and useful
Sep 06 03:24:31 <scela>	mistria: your ECA has expired it seems, or you probably had the issue I had a week ago or so (when I asked you to push the example thing as I couldn't)
Sep 06 03:24:53 <mistria>	scela: yeah, I've added a note to the bug

Sep 06 08:36:10 <scela>	mbooth: remember our friend lucene the fast-releaser? I set up everything working fine with lucene 6.1. Now 6.2 asks for backward-codecs to read the 6.1 index
Sep 06 08:36:23 <mbooth>	Hah
Sep 06 08:36:24 <scela>	and causes 11 test failuers
Sep 06 08:36:33 <mbooth>	scela: Lucene is comedy gold :-)
Sep 06 08:38:27 <scela>	mbooth: i really can't imagine how people keep up with them

Sep 06 08:40:12 *	scela shakes fist at monitor
Sep 06 08:40:49 <mbooth>	scela: I think the short answer is: They don't keep up, probably just pick a version from Maven central and then leave it alone....

Sep 06 12:18:43 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff. I have 2 pending patches for review on Gerrit. Would you have time to review them before tonight's RC3 build ?
Sep 06 12:19:04 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I should be able to
Sep 06 12:19:44 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: great ! I have to go for errands but I'll be available later if you have any question or issue with the patches
Sep 06 12:19:56 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: ok
Sep 06 14:42:24 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: a colleague reported https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500933 earlier today while testing the OpenShift tooling. Basically, he had some images with a name but no tag in his Docker connection and they would not appear in the Docker tooling (but they do appear in the output of 'docker images'). We'll work further on this issue tomorrow, because for now I'm unable to reproduce the problem. I wonder if this could be included in 
Sep 06 14:42:28 <xcoulon>	wdyt ?
Sep 06 14:43:29 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: unless you have some images with no tag (ie, "<none>") on your machine ?
Sep 06 14:43:55 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: yes, we can make a last minute bug fix to RC4 if necessary
Sep 06 14:45:15 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: great ! I hope this will be a simple fix. Apparently, the images would appear if the filters are desactivated, so I assume it's a matter of setting the 'dangling' and 'intermediate' flags properly on this edge case. But so far, I could not see what's wrong in the code, so I need to investigate a little more with Marian tomorrow
Sep 06 14:45:23 <xcoulon>	I'll keep you updated
Sep 06 14:45:29 <jjohnstn>	ok
Sep 06 15:42:06 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff. Did you need my help for the remaining tasks for RC3 or are you good ?
Sep 06 15:42:15 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon
Sep 06 15:42:23 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I'm fine
Sep 06 15:42:30 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: thx
Sep 06 15:42:38 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: great ! in that case, I'll just shutdown the laptop ;-)
Sep 06 15:42:41 <xcoulon>	thanks
Sep 06 15:42:55 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: bye
Sep 06 15:42:57 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: have a good evening
Sep 06 15:43:10 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: thanks ! samewise !
Sep 07 04:12:17 <xcoulon>	mistria: hello Mickael. I need your help on JBoss Tools: I have this error when I run an 'mvn clean verify' on JBoss Tools OpenShift repo: http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/409417
Sep 07 07:43:50 <akurtakov>	https://akurtakov.fedorapeople.org/buttoncss.webm :)
Sep 07 09:32:48 <ipun>	akurtakov, what tool do you use to make webms of your desktop for demonstrations?

Sep 07 12:08:48 <rgrunber>	mbooth: reproduced on f24 ?
Sep 07 12:09:10 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Yes
Sep 07 12:10:23 <akurtakov>	ipun: thanks
Sep 07 12:13:33 <rgrunber>	mbooth: also.. http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/409678
Sep 07 12:14:41 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Ah, that must be the convo I remember...
Sep 07 12:15:11 <rgrunber>	that was for fedora though.
Sep 07 12:16:04 <rgrunber>	i think what we concluded was that if cdt-parsers depends on cdt-core then it's ok.. because the symlink will resolve.. but you say that cdt-parsers can exist without core ?
Sep 07 12:18:09 <mbooth>	rgrunber: No, the opposite -- cdt without cdt-parsers -- the symlink will be installed by cdt but the req is from cdt-parsers
Sep 07 12:18:25 <rgrunber>	ahh..
Sep 07 12:19:03 <rgrunber>	hmm but if only cdt-parsers needs it.. it's technically just a packaging standards bug.
Sep 07 12:22:17 <mbooth>	Yeah, I guess it *should* be the case that the only breakage is a broken symlink...
Sep 07 12:24:07 <rgrunber>	still probably worth investigating..
Sep 07 12:31:07 <rgrunber>	mbooth: consider the docker bug taken off your hands :P
Sep 08 05:42:32 <scela>	mistria: i've actually no idea about what icon would make sense
Sep 08 05:42:40 <scela>	would be nice if there's one ready-made
Sep 08 05:43:11 <scela>	akurtakov: do you know of an icon that would fit our generic editor?
Sep 08 05:44:12 <akurtakov>	scela: hmm, where do you want to use it ?
Sep 08 05:44:49 <akurtakov>	I always connected icons in explorer with file type not with editor to use for it
Sep 08 05:44:58 <akurtakov>	or I'm misunderstanding the question
Sep 08 05:45:56 <scela>	akurtakov: i suppose it will be common and linked with the editor, rather than content type
Sep 08 05:46:25 <akurtakov>	in the package explorer?
Sep 08 05:46:38 <scela>	in the editor tab
Sep 08 05:47:17 <akurtakov>	ah now I get it :)
Sep 08 05:55:57 <scela>	akurtakov: fyi, about putting it in M2 dani says he's more worried about breaking releng stuff so late, rather than our stuff being broken
Sep 08 05:56:15 <scela>	akurtakov: by releng stuff he means https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497871#c11
Sep 08 05:56:15 <akurtakov>	hmm
Sep 08 05:57:11 <akurtakov>	hmm, I hate the way tests are run now
Sep 08 05:57:19 <akurtakov>	I can see his point
Sep 08 06:01:16 <akurtakov>	commented on the bug
Sep 08 06:01:53 <akurtakov>	although getting the code in even if tests not run or not in a feature shouldn't be an issue and will actualy only minimize the risk
Sep 08 06:28:21 <mistria>	akurtakov: instead of some complex XML, the test could be a single huge test bundle referencing all Test Suites
Sep 08 09:33:05 <scela>	mistria: I'm already trying to come up with the icon
Sep 08 09:33:20 <scela>	did you spend much effort on it or shall I go on?
Sep 08 09:33:40 <mistria>	scela: go ahead
Sep 08 09:33:57 <mistria>	scela: I spent some efforts thinking about it, but it was fruitless, I didn't start anything
Sep 08 09:34:38 <scela>	mistria: i asked lars about some details as he has quite some experience with this
Sep 08 09:34:46 <scela>	in the sense of multiple resolutions etc.
Sep 08 09:34:54 <scela>	but I can do the 'drawing'
Sep 08 09:40:47 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: on now call about what dev program leads discussed in Westford a few weeks ago / upcoming work
Sep 08 09:40:54 <mbenitez>	https://redhat.bluejeans.com/3801535957/
Sep 08 10:29:51 <rgrunber>	mbooth: the bug you pointed me to should be resolved.. the other (regarding unix sockets) is a bit more concerning now.
Sep 08 10:30:19 <rgrunber>	*by resolved i mean i'll push a solution soon..
Sep 08 12:16:15 <scela>	mistria: https://imgur.com/a/AL1Fo
Sep 08 12:16:34 <mistria>	scela: good enough for the moment
Sep 08 12:16:47 <scela>	yeah I think it's ugly but not enough ugly to be a blocker now
Sep 08 12:17:08 <scela>	i think I'll go with this one
Sep 08 12:17:13 <scela>	probably tonight I'll push it

Sep 09 11:51:46 <rgrunber>	mbooth: ping (re: eclipse branches on fedora)
Sep 09 11:56:46 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Hey
Sep 09 11:57:13 <rgrunber>	mbooth: for eclipse-linuxtools, any plans to update f24 to 5.1.0, or any of that stack ?
Sep 09 11:57:21 <rgrunber>	likely.. not ?
Sep 09 12:00:40 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Erm, since F24 has Neon, it probably makes sense to update to the neon point releases
Sep 09 12:00:45 <mbooth>	Once released
Sep 09 12:01:35 <rgrunber>	was asking because f24 branch is on the commit before 5.1.0 but i've added a docker tooling fix that applies to all so .. was curious if i should cherry pick or fast-forward.
Sep 09 12:31:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I found q fix for Bug 500969: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/80831/ the problem was that the 'passwords' collection was the same reference as the registry accounts, so the same registry account was added twice: once upon dialog completion and then once when all modifications where processed, when the preference page was closed. 
Sep 09 12:32:33 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I have to go now, but we can further discuss about the patch on Monday if you want to.
Sep 09 12:37:08 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: k sounds fine.
Sep 09 13:02:59 <rgrunber>	mbooth: sorry about not addressing some of those rhbz rhscl ones sooner.. i must have only been following things where the component was rh-eclipse46.
Sep 09 13:03:19 <mbooth>	rgrunber: No worries, thanks for taking a look :-)
Sep 09 13:03:27 <rgrunber>	and https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1368140 is kinda subtle... very stuble..
Sep 09 13:10:27 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: ping
Sep 09 13:21:12 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: nvm

Sep 12 12:48:19 <mloriedo1>	mbenitez: thanks ;-)
Sep 12 14:29:27 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i think i've found the issue in the cdt rhscl build. it does appear to be a cycle.. i have lpgjava symlink being created in cdt-parsers once i applied a fix (instead of current behaviour of core).. just wanna look at an rpmdiff to confirm nothing else is changing.
Sep 13 10:12:32 <rgrunber>	mbooth: any idea what's happening here ? http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=15615501
Sep 13 10:13:01 <rgrunber>	'Error: nothing provides osgi(org.eclipse.jdt.core) = 3.12.0.v20160903.1000 needed by eclipse-contributor-tools-1:4.6.0-7.fc26.aarch64.'
Sep 13 10:13:24 <mbooth>	Aye, rebootstrapping is occurring
Sep 13 10:13:34 <rgrunber>	yarr.. for yet another arch
Sep 13 10:19:27 <rgrunber>	mbooth: slight good news.. your dead symlinks in cdt-land should get resolved.

Sep 13 10:20:02 <rgrunber>	and now i'm thinking of making fp-p2 log a warning when there is a cycle.. because it can actually detect that..
Sep 13 10:20:31 <mbooth>	Might be a good idea :-)
Sep 13 10:43:08 <akurtakov_>	rgrunber: definetely go for it 
Sep 13 10:43:19 <akurtakov_>	we might consider even breaking the build if possible
Sep 13 10:44:35 <rgrunber>	akurtakov_: i thought about failing immediately.. but we probably want the option to "just build it" and if it's small enough of an issue.. fix it afterwards..
Sep 13 10:45:14 <akurtakov_>	ok, let it be a warning for now
Sep 13 10:45:35 <akurtakov_>	but if more similar issues appear we should bump it to break the build 
Sep 13 10:45:57 <rgrunber>	yeah, as for upstream.. i'll have to see if there's any reason for that to exist : http://git.eclipse.org/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt.git/tree/cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote-feature/feature.xml when source-feature should handle source bundles.

Sep 14 11:59:50 <nboldt>	it can wait. Just clarifying if the test is MEANINGFUL, given comments from Chris and the fact that to date, it's never caught a problem :D
Sep 14 11:59:53 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, wait - are we going live with the bits before the 21st?
Sep 14 11:59:53 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_: ^
Sep 14 12:00:00 <nboldt>	yes. that's the plan
Sep 14 12:00:22 <nboldt>	bits are needed to be live so that the devsuite online installer can be BUILT and then TESTED
Sep 14 12:00:42 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, the bits will be live - but we won't tell anyone until the 21st?
Sep 14 12:00:43 <nboldt>	it requires that openjdk, cdt, rhel, vagrant stuff, and devstudio all be LIVE in production download manager
Sep 14 12:00:57 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_: yes, just like in June. Release this week, announce next week
Sep 14 12:01:52 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, that's what I thought the plan was - if we can wait, I'd like to wait as I am buried and their test is running - and maybe change the test after it completes 
Sep 14 12:02:36 <nboldt>	You're delaying Denis' ability to build something. if he can't build it, he can't have it tested
Sep 14 12:03:13 <nboldt>	so... could mean that devsuite is pushed to prod on Monday (because generally siege won't push new stuff out on a Friday to avoid a "commit'n'run" problem over the weekend
Sep 14 12:07:51 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, OK - let me check the checksums - now
Sep 14 12:16:43 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_: I did that already :) see https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/RCM-6841
Sep 14 12:19:46 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, I just verified that you performed a redundant task - or maybe I did - OK to go live!

Probably for SSL connections to docker instances, I would guess. It seems unlikely that anyone is using these algorithms in SSL certificates so I'm happy to just remove them
Sep 14 12:20:27 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Is there a bug, or shall I file one?
Sep 14 12:20:34 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yeah iirc we mainly use PEMParser, PEMReader.. or something along those lines..
Sep 14 12:20:43 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, can I not go back to banging my head against a different wall?   ;-)
Sep 14 12:21:02 <mbenitez>	mbooth, good to hear, let's file a bug and go ahead with the removal you propose
Sep 14 12:21:10 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Yep, PEMParser and PEMKeyPair
Sep 14 12:21:11 <mbenitez>	thanks for looking at this so quickly!
Sep 14 12:21:13 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_: if you sign off in the RCM ticket, then yes
Sep 14 12:21:29 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, just did - lata....
Sep 14 12:23:12 <ldimaggi_>	thx!
Sep 14 12:33:01 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, is it ok if I dev_ack this 1374634 ? says fix is in 5.1.0
Sep 14 12:33:47 <rgrunber>	yeah it should get pulled back into the rpm once we update.
Sep 14 12:34:40 <mbenitez>	great, thanks
Sep 14 14:55:13 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: for https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1374214 , should i be adding a 'Doc Type' of 'Known Issue' ?
Sep 14 14:56:07 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, yes, that makes sense
Sep 15 05:28:35 <akurtakov>	mistria: thanks for bringing the case for CWidgets
Sep 15 05:28:44 <akurtakov>	needles to say that I hate them :)
Sep 15 05:42:16 <mistria>	akurtakov: :)
Sep 15 09:03:22 <jkang>	lufimtse, ooc, do you still use trello?
Sep 15 09:06:41 <akurtakov>	mbooth: can you point me to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1367019 upstream clone ?
Sep 15 10:49:39 <nboldt>	akurtakov: rgrunber: what's the easiest way to inject a timestamp into the generated artifact filename when producing an rpm? 
Sep 15 10:50:02 <nboldt>	I could just rename stuff w/ shell script but was wondering if there was something I could do in the spec file
Sep 15 10:51:20 <nboldt>	eg., a self-contained way rather than a bolted-on way
Sep 15 10:51:50 <akurtakov>	by generated artifact you mean as in qualifier for bundles?
Sep 15 10:51:52 <rgrunber>	nboldt: this is for an osgi bundle, built by tycho ?
Sep 15 10:53:02 <rgrunber>	i'm guessing not because default for 'eclipse-plugin' is to have a build-qualifier set.
Sep 15 10:54:48 <rgrunber>	i guess to force your own you could try '-DforceContextQualifier=...'
Sep 15 10:55:19 <rgrunber>	ie.. what we do in eclipse spec..
Sep 15 10:55:53 <nboldt>	no, I mean when producing rh-eclipse46-devstudio-1.0-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
Sep 15 10:56:12 <nboldt>	would like each one to have a unique timestamp in the filename so they're easier to differentiate & know when it was built
Sep 15 10:56:41 <mbooth>	nboldt: Add something to the Release: tag is probably best
Sep 15 10:56:42 <nboldt>	instead of 1.0-1, want something like 1.0-1-20160915-1100
Sep 15 10:57:42 <nboldt>	ok, and how do I declare a variable in a spec file? (I could google this I guess...)
Sep 15 10:58:46 <nboldt>	can i pass things in to rpmbuild --define "something something" ?
Sep 15 10:59:10 <mbooth>	So at the top of the spec file you could put something like:
Sep 15 10:59:17 <rgrunber>	%global foo $(date ...)
Sep 15 10:59:17 <mbooth>	%{expand: %%global stamp %(date -u +%Y$m%d-%H%M)}
Sep 15 10:59:45 <mbooth>	Then in the Release: tag you can put %{stamp}
Sep 15 10:59:45 <nboldt>	and then ref it as %{stamp} ?
Sep 15 10:59:48 <nboldt>	nice
Sep 15 10:59:49 <mbooth>	Yeah
Sep 15 11:00:14 *	nboldt cheers for bash-like embedding
Sep 15 11:00:43 <mbooth>	Yeah, RPM has pretty ugly macro "language"
Sep 15 11:01:01 <nboldt>	meh, this works
Sep 15 11:06:11 <akurtakov>	nboldt: mbooth: you can always go for lua if you like it more 
Sep 15 11:06:14 *	akurtakov hides :)
Sep 15 11:09:12 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Lua Lua / oh no / it's gotta go ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PVoVRUrxVY
Sep 15 11:10:26 <akurtakov>	mbooth: btw, nice on putting neon.1 platform

Sep 15 16:04:47 <mbenitez>	jjohnstn|wfh, gold star for compass :) thanks
Sep 15 16:39:40 <jjohnstn|wfh>	mbenitez: np
Sep 16 07:43:39 <akurtakov>	mistria: reading ide-dev?
Sep 16 07:43:58 <akurtakov>	I can't make my mind do I care for dark theme or I'm totally ignorant :P
Sep 16 08:35:44 <mistria>	akurtakov: yeah, I'm following
Sep 16 08:36:03 <mistria>	akurtakov: It's a part of the debate I'm better out
Sep 16 08:36:15 <mistria>	akurtakov: I hate dark themes so much I prefer remaining silent
Sep 16 08:36:43 <akurtakov>	mistria: sure, I don't use them myself but they proved to be really good testcase for swt bugs :)
Sep 16 08:37:32 <mistria>	akurtakov: that's indeed a benefit we can find them
Sep 16 08:37:54 <mistria>	akurtakov: we have some UI bits in JBoss Tools which look very bad in dark theme
Sep 16 08:38:25 <mistria>	akurtakov: but it's some old Eclipse code that was copied... so I believe the UI itself is to blame more than the theme or the theming engine
Sep 16 08:39:04 <akurtakov>	someone once told me Ctrl+C/Ctrl+P should be forbidden in IDEs :)
Sep 16 08:39:40 <mistria>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-20045
Sep 16 08:42:43 <akurtakov>	mistria: ah, this is windows?
Sep 16 08:42:54 <mistria>	akurtakov: don't know
Sep 16 08:43:20 <akurtakov>	I came to that conclusion based on the scrollbar on one of the screenshots and button on the other
Sep 16 08:43:30 <mistria>	akurtakov: I think Fred uses Windows, but feel free to ask on the bug
Sep 16 08:47:07 <mistria>	akurtakov: one day, suddenly, Apple or Google or whatever company people trust blindly will make a statement that dark themes are bad
Sep 16 08:47:17 <akurtakov>	haha :)
Sep 16 08:47:26 <mistria>	akurtakov: and suddenly, all people will believe it and stop with their dark themes
Sep 16 08:47:49 <akurtakov>	one day MS will adopt gtk or qt as the way of doing UI :) 
Sep 16 08:48:43 <mistria>	akurtakov: well, with VSCode multi-platform, C# on Linux, SQL Server on Linux... I believe they're already adopting Linux as the developer environment.
Sep 16 08:49:04 <akurtakov>	yeah, final step is to give up on win32 :)
Sep 16 08:49:11 <akurtakov>	MFC :)
Sep 16 08:50:39 <akurtakov>	I'm eager to try running swt/gtk on windows
Sep 16 08:50:55 <akurtakov>	but first I must get rid of gtk2 support to be able to drop the X11 deps
Sep 16 08:51:05 <akurtakov>	but it's days are numbered :)

Sep 16 09:46:08 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: ping (re. stack overflow)
Sep 16 14:30:06 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: what's up ?
Sep 16 14:31:07 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: i tried reproducing in a mock environment.. but it succeeds.. diffing against the logs up until where you see the failure shows they're identical.. but no error for me.
Sep 16 14:31:38 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: ah, ok probaly it's my environment having some plugin installed causing it
Sep 16 14:31:42 <akurtakov>	never mind in this case
Sep 16 14:31:51 <rgrunber>	i *may* need your .m2 folder (or possible just .m2/p2/ and the metadata.. in case something fishy is happening with that.
Sep 16 14:32:38 <rgrunber>	also i had to patch eclipse-packagekit to pull from neon (it's not in master)
Sep 16 14:35:10 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: never mind as long as mock works it's fine :)
Sep 16 14:35:24 <akurtakov>	I don't have the powre to investigate it more :)
Sep 16 14:36:12 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: maybe back up your .m2 folder if you have time.. i'm fairly sure i know where the error is happening.. but without some more info it's hard to say why it happens.
Sep 16 14:36:22 <rgrunber>	:P.. it is intersting
Sep 16 14:36:47 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: it's 4 GB :)
Sep 16 14:36:56 <akurtakov>	I guess it's time ot delete it :)
Sep 16 14:37:01 <rgrunber>	haha
Sep 16 14:38:24 <rgrunber>	how big is your .m2/p2, .m2/.cache, .m2/.meta ? any better.. pretty sure it'd just be those needed.
Sep 16 14:48:25 <akurtakov>	p2 is 883
Sep 16 14:48:29 <akurtakov>	MB
Sep 16 14:48:38 <rgrunber>	yikes.. bah
Sep 16 14:48:57 <akurtakov>	:)
Sep 16 14:49:08 <akurtakov>	you see, too much bload
Sep 16 14:49:11 <rgrunber>	hmm maybe try just .m2/cache and .m2/.meta .. it's worth a shot in case i can actually reproduce off cached metadata..
Sep 16 14:49:18 <akurtakov>	le me remove it
Sep 16 14:49:27 <akurtakov>	cached is 21mb
Sep 16 14:49:58 <akurtakov>	meta is 112k single file
Sep 16 14:50:13 <rgrunber>	that sounds fine to me.
Sep 16 14:51:17 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: btw, have you looked at dbus-java ?
Sep 16 14:51:28 <akurtakov>	can we get it in orbit?
Sep 16 14:51:48 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: it's approved.. so i presume yes.
Sep 16 14:52:10 <akurtakov>	would we need to file packagekit cq first for linuxtools ?
Sep 16 14:53:05 <akurtakov>	anyway, it would be nice to see whether we can bulid eclipse-packagekit against it
Sep 16 14:53:18 <akurtakov>	if we can, I would start the contribution process for linuxtools
Sep 16 14:56:05 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: so the issue is with libmatthew-java
Sep 16 14:56:27 <akurtakov>	do we have dbus-java without libmatthew-java ?
Sep 16 14:57:37 <akurtakov>	I think I managed to get that CQ finished
Sep 16 14:58:40 <akurtakov>	https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4828
Sep 16 14:59:55 <rgrunber>	k so we have everything then. sorry a bit confused..
Sep 16 15:00:12 <rgrunber>	i though the issue was libmatthew but it's that dbus-java was initally Academic License or something.
Sep 16 15:00:50 <rgrunber>	but it was re-licensed https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=8063
Sep 16 15:02:55 <akurtakov>	yeah, long story 
Sep 16 15:04:22 <akurtakov>	I just lost patience with this one somewhere
Sep 16 15:04:54 <rgrunber>	so do you want to push eclipse-packagekit into eclipse foundation?
Sep 16 15:05:13 <rgrunber>	or just not have to build in a hacky way with only xmvn.
Sep 16 15:05:28 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: I want to push it to linuxtools
Sep 16 15:05:38 <akurtakov>	so it can be used in rpm tooling
Sep 16 15:05:42 <akurtakov>	and probably others
Sep 16 15:06:15 <akurtakov>	but proving it can be built with the jars from cqs
Sep 16 15:06:23 <akurtakov>	is a prereq for even trying :)
Sep 16 15:07:00 <akurtakov>	if you can investigate it and let me know next week, I would be reall thankful
Sep 16 15:07:05 <rgrunber>	yeah.. well from what i see only thing missing is ato-cqs and getting it in.. so it should be possible.
Sep 16 15:11:53 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: so please create rough orbit bundles and try packagekit build against them
Sep 16 15:11:58 <akurtakov>	if it works we proceed
Sep 16 15:12:14 <akurtakov>	time to go to bed
Sep 16 15:12:17 <akurtakov>	tty next week

Sep 19 09:56:14 <nboldt>	hey, any mock experts about? mbooth ? wondering if I can easily run two mock-based builds of rh-eclipse46-devstudio rpm in parallel without them accidentally using the same mock locations
Sep 19 09:57:21 <nboldt>	do I just use a different config_opts['basedir'] = '/var/lib/mock'
Sep 19 09:57:21 <nboldt>	for each run?
Sep 19 09:57:38 <nboldt>	or config_opts['macros']['%_topdir'] = '/builddir/build' ?
Sep 19 09:57:56 <nboldt>	do the config_opts['root'] = '${mock_cfg}' values need to be unique too?
Sep 19 09:59:08 <nboldt>	mbooth: looking in https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/build.sh#L270 for how to config so each version of the build (devstudio 10.1, 10.2) can safely run w/o crashing into each other
Sep 19 09:59:38 <jerboaa>	nboldt, you could create a dupe mock config with config_opts['root'] changed, perhaps?
Sep 19 09:59:54 <mbooth>	nboldt: Hey, using two mock roots simultaneously is normally fine -- you could probably just change the value of this var: https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/build.sh#L272
Sep 19 10:04:55 <nboldt>	mbooth: so it's only the 'root' that matters?
Sep 19 10:06:09 <nboldt>	they can share the same /builddir/build folder and use /var/lib/mock for both too? 
Sep 19 10:06:35 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yeah, they are basically chroot jails underneath, so each 'root' is isolated from one another
Sep 19 10:07:58 <nboldt>	sweet, thanks
Sep 19 10:07:58 <jerboaa>	don't think they share /builddir/build. AFAIK that's within /var/lib/mock/<root>/root/
Sep 19 10:08:36 <rgrunber>	they would share /var/cache/mock/$cfg ..
Sep 19 10:08:41 <nboldt>	thx, jerboaa, mbooth. will try it. results TBD in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4051
Sep 19 10:09:06 <rgrunber>	ahh.. multiple mock builds off same config?
Sep 19 10:09:17 <nboldt>	well, SIMILAR config. 
Sep 19 10:09:37 <nboldt>	two parallel builds using more or less the same config, but fetching p2 repo sources from different update sites
Sep 19 10:09:53 <nboldt>	one for devstudio 10.1 (stable build) and one for devstudio 10.2 (CI build)
Sep 19 10:10:03 <nboldt>	because, continuous delivery & stuff
Sep 19 10:10:41 <nboldt>	does the value of 'root' ever appear in the resulting RPM? could I use 'foo' and 'bar' ?
Sep 19 10:11:02 <nboldt>	or should I use something like rh-eclipse46-10.1 and rh-eclipse46-10.2 ?
Sep 19 10:11:04 <jerboaa>	its the folder in /var/lib/mock
Sep 19 10:11:37 <nboldt>	so it's irrelephant to installation of the rpm once it's built? never seen by an end user?
Sep 19 10:11:49 <nboldt>	(irrelephant = not relevant to elephants)
Sep 19 10:12:03 <nboldt>	:D
Sep 19 10:12:07 <jerboaa>	:) that's my understanding
Sep 19 10:12:11 <nboldt>	sweet, thx
Sep 19 10:12:28 <nboldt>	then I can just pass in the job name (which is unique within a Jenkins instance) and we'll be OK here
Sep 19 10:13:06 <jerboaa>	if disk space is of no concern ;-)
Sep 19 10:14:01 <jerboaa>	for an openjdk build that's ~4GB
Sep 19 10:14:31 <jerboaa>	(per mock root)
Sep 19 10:17:15 <nboldt>	jerboaa: yeah, I've got space on wonka
Sep 19 10:17:30 <nboldt>	... should I be purging mock roots when done?
Sep 19 10:17:35 <nboldt>	or do they clean themselves up?
Sep 19 10:19:44 <jerboaa>	not sure. It depend on how mock builds are triggered. there are a couple of options. e.g. --no-cleanup-after.
Sep 19 10:20:07 <jerboaa>	man page says: Don't clean chroot after building. If automatic cleanup is enabled, use this to disable.
Sep 19 10:20:40 <rgrunber>	well any new build son that chroot would clean before starting.. unless '--no-clean' is given.
Sep 19 10:20:45 <rgrunber>	builds on*
Sep 19 10:21:04 <jerboaa>	yes. same root. but if they don't get reused...
Sep 19 10:21:35 <jerboaa>	/var/lib/mock/jenkins-1 /var/lib/mock/jenkins-2 ...
Sep 19 10:21:51 <mbooth>	But they should get resused if nboldt is doing it per-job, not per-build...
Sep 19 10:22:16 <jerboaa>	right
Sep 19 10:22:55 *	jerboaa totally missed "per job name", sorry
Sep 19 10:23:01 <rgrunber>	yeah, i'm just thinking how much of a hit is going to be taken for a clean.. if that chroot needs to be set up once again.
Sep 19 10:23:50 <nboldt>	ah, seems my build.sh (which is derived from mbooth's original) uses mock --no-clean
Sep 19 10:24:24 <nboldt>	which makes subsequent rebuilds faster... but less "continuous integration/delivery" 
Sep 19 10:24:50 <nboldt>	so... I guess I should make that optional or remove it entirely? */me ponders*
Sep 19 10:25:56 <rgrunber>	seems like you want some kind of listener on the yum repos being used.. and only remove '--no-clean' if there's been changes..
Sep 19 10:26:32 <rgrunber>	might even be some yum plugin for this
Sep 19 10:31:52 <rgrunber>	or i guess you could just call mock -r .. --update 
Sep 19 10:32:30 <nboldt>	looks like the mock root for a devstudio rpm build is 3.2G
Sep 19 10:32:47 <nboldt>	so... definitely don't want to have to spool that up for EVERY ci build
Sep 19 10:33:37 <rgrunber>	so then --no-clean and maybe a --update prior to every build to make sure it's up to date.
Sep 19 11:35:00 <nboldt>	rgrunber: mbooth: hey, does rh-eclipse46-base.x86_64 need to require jdk 1.7?
Sep 19 11:35:25 <mbooth>	nboldt: No, you can assume jdk 8 is installed
Sep 19 11:35:26 <nboldt>	because I recently updated to java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel-1:1.8.0.102-1.b14.fc24.x86_64 in favour of java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel-1:1.7.0.91-2.6.2.3.el7.x86_64 and now I can't install rh-eclipse46-base.x86_64
Sep 19 11:35:52 <akurtakov>	we should req 1.8 IIRC
Sep 19 11:36:17 <nboldt>	http://pastebin.com/2CaVDU1Y
Sep 19 11:36:20 <nboldt>	akurtakov: ^
Sep 19 11:36:45 <akurtakov>	neon itself requires 1.8 so hard req 1.7 looks like plain bug to me
Sep 19 11:37:01 <akurtakov>	ah that's maven33
Sep 19 11:37:03 <mbooth>	nboldt: Hmm, mixing Fedora and RHEL RPMs?
Sep 19 11:37:24 <nboldt>	yeah. how else can I install-test the stuff I'm building?
Sep 19 11:37:36 <nboldt>	I don't have a RHEL7 license. CSP won't let me download it
Sep 19 11:37:56 *	akurtakov is leaving it to mbooth to handle now :)
Sep 19 11:38:07 <nboldt>	rh-eclipse46.repo with baseurl=http://download.devel.redhat.com/brewroot/repos/rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7-build/latest/x86_64 used to work until I installed jdk8
Sep 19 11:38:37 <nboldt>	so... seems like a bug in the rh-eclipse46-base package that it requires 1.7, not 1.7+
Sep 19 11:38:52 <mbooth>	nboldt: I use either a EL7 VM or install into a mock root
Sep 19 11:39:12 <mbooth>	nboldt: Installing el7 packages on fedora is not really supported
Sep 19 11:39:31 <nboldt>	hmm. can you explain how to do mock root install inside F24?
Sep 19 11:39:50 <nboldt>	or where I can get .iso for RHEL7 which won't tell me I need some entitlement?
Sep 19 11:39:56 <nboldt>	(Should I use centos vm?
Sep 19 11:40:40 <mbooth>	I thought all employees could get RHEL license, but CentOS will probably work
Sep 19 11:41:00 <mbooth>	To install an RPM directly into a mock root:
Sep 19 11:41:01 <mbooth>	mock -r ... --install /path/to/rpm
Sep 19 11:43:06 <mbooth>	nboldt: Thinking about it, I recall prodding mbenitez about getting RHEL entitlement, but the mists of time obscure what actually happened....
Sep 19 11:44:36 <mbooth>	But for the record, you can see we explicitly require java 1.8 here: http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/rpms/rh-eclipse46/tree/rh-eclipse46.spec?h=rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7#n118
Sep 19 11:48:39 <mbooth>	nboldt: BTW, what's the best way to propose blacklist additions? Github PR?
Sep 19 11:52:16 <nboldt>	mbooth: yes
Sep 19 11:52:54 <nboldt>	I just removed openjdk 1.8 and downgraded to 1.7, and rh-eclipse46-base is installing again in F24
Sep 19 11:53:02 <nboldt>	so... that's a feature-not-a-bug there
Sep 19 11:53:31 *	nboldt downloads the internet and 230 yum packages again...
Sep 19 12:02:04 <rgrunber>	if you've downloaded the internet.. what's another 230 yum packages added to the list.
Sep 19 12:03:39 <nboldt>	rgrunber: true
Sep 19 12:04:24 <nboldt>	so... ok. I have a jenkins rpm build working now for both master (devstudio 10.2) and 4.4.1.x branch (devstudio 10.1 sources). the master one fires every time upstream devstudio product build runs
Sep 19 12:04:58 <nboldt>	now we just need to ensure that we're not installing too much/too little (cc: mbooth) and that everything in devstudio Actually Works 
Sep 19 12:05:29 <mbenitez>	nboldt, from the developer program you should have access to a RHEL 7  subscription I think...
Sep 19 12:05:44 <mbenitez>	but send me a note if you need something else
Sep 19 12:06:07 *	mbenitez at full day PCP mtgs Mon-Wed thus slow responses
Sep 19 12:07:25 <nboldt>	mbenitez: PCP? Yeah, that would make you slow. :D https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine#Effects
Sep 19 12:07:43 *	nboldt wonders what PCP stands for (for real) in this context
Sep 19 12:07:50 <mbenitez>	haha different pcp performance co-pilot
Sep 19 12:08:35 <nboldt>	yeah, the drug's definitely not described as helping performance :D ... quite the opposite
Sep 19 12:10:26 <rgrunber>	blame fche
Sep 19 12:20:40 <mbooth>	nboldt: It's interesting that devstudio ships "org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility.auth" considering that bundle was deleted upstream years ago... http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.runtime.git/commit/bundles/org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility.auth?id=9c85295f0b0431a27bf4108ae28cf25fc3f7dec4
Sep 19 12:22:01 <fche>	WHAT WHAT WHAT ???!
Sep 19 12:22:23 <fche>	(re. 10 mins ago)
Sep 19 12:22:29 <fche>	(my minions informed me of my name being taken in vain)
Sep 19 12:24:20 <nboldt>	mbooth: maybe something depends on it. We generally don't carry obsolete  garbage along for no reason :D
Sep 19 12:24:49 <nboldt>	if I had to guess I'd say it's because of integration stack being 6-12 months behind us in moving to latest Eclipse
Sep 19 12:26:29 <nboldt>	fche: unclear as to the context for rgrunber's comment "blame fche". Riffing on South Park movieism?
Sep 19 12:26:48 <rgrunber>	nboldt: pretty sure he named PCP ..
Sep 19 12:26:56 <nboldt>	rgrunber: oic
Sep 19 12:27:00 <nboldt>	THAT context :D
Sep 19 12:27:30 *	fche didn't name pcp
Sep 19 12:27:41 <fche>	some boffins from sgi did some twenty years gao
Sep 19 12:27:42 <fche>	ago

Sep 20 11:03:06 <jorton>	mbenitez: mbooth: hi folks, can you get the rh-eclipse46 errata back on QE asap?  last one outstanding https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/24366
Sep 20 11:04:52 <mbenitez>	jorton, it's almost done, will be in QE before EOD no problem
Sep 20 11:07:04 <jorton>	mbenitez: great, thanks!
Sep 20 11:07:16 <mbenitez>	np!
Sep 20 11:16:14 <nboldt1>	mistria: mbooth: any topics for today's build.next call? if not I'll cancel it
Sep 20 11:17:01 <nboldt1>	only item left from last week is the one about setting up a user for generating and pushing PRs into jbdevstudio-website and jbosstools-download.jboss.org repos when it's time to push out a stage or release build
Sep 20 11:17:10 <nboldt1>	but that's not a discussion, it's an action item :D
Sep 20 11:17:25 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Nothing from me
Sep 20 11:18:01 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: mbooth: rgrunber: looks like all my subtasks/bugs with the rh-eclipse46-devstudio rpm are squashed/done. devstudio runs super slow on my machine when installed from rpm, but it works
Sep 20 11:18:25 <nboldt1>	could be memory setting defaults in the rh-eclipse46-base are too low for optimal devstudio performance
Sep 20 11:18:33 <nboldt1>	but for beta quality I'm happy
Sep 20 11:19:16 <mistria>	nboldt1: no topic for me
Sep 20 11:19:58 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, it is good to hear there's a working beta, nice job
Sep 20 11:21:09 <nboldt1>	mistria: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-23159 comments welcome
Sep 20 11:21:46 <nboldt1>	hey, is having a Trash folder in google calendar new, or has that always been there? 
Sep 20 11:23:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill: here?
Sep 20 11:23:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov hey
Sep 20 11:23:32 <akurtakov>	ericwill: seen my comment on the error handler?
Sep 20 11:24:30 <ericwill>	akurtakov just saw it, will revert the fix and allow Stefan to re-do
Sep 20 11:24:46 <akurtakov>	well, don't revert
Sep 20 11:24:48 <akurtakov>	this is ugly game
Sep 20 11:25:04 <akurtakov>	but be more careful when someone tries to expose api
Sep 20 11:25:20 <akurtakov>	as long as we get a buy in from Stefan soon we should be fine
Sep 20 11:25:33 <ericwill>	okay
Sep 20 11:25:36 <ericwill>	a buy in?
Sep 20 11:25:41 <akurtakov>	if no response from him in the next few days revert on Friday
Sep 20 11:26:04 <ericwill>	kk
Sep 20 11:27:08 <akurtakov>	ah, actually revert
Sep 20 11:27:14 <akurtakov>	he bumped the version too
Sep 20 11:27:33 <akurtakov>	and we already bumped in the oxygen train so definetely a no-go
Sep 20 11:28:30 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ^
Sep 20 11:28:47 <ericwill>	akurtakov will do
Sep 20 11:28:58 <ericwill>	akurtakov on master, does your SWT tools work?
Sep 20 11:29:03 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: so now I just need to figure out how to deliver it... have to publish in such a way it's installable from a yum repo
Sep 20 11:29:16 <akurtakov>	ericwill: what do you mean?
Sep 20 11:29:20 <akurtakov>	what issue do you see
Sep 20 11:29:27 <nboldt1>	eg., throw it up on devstudio.redhat.com/10.0/stable/yum_repo/ something something
Sep 20 11:29:43 <ericwill>	akurtakov the SWT tools plugin threw an error telling me that the JNI build failed
Sep 20 11:29:49 <ericwill>	also, I see an error in the SWT build path
Sep 20 11:29:51 <ericwill>	"Build path entry is missing: org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT Program/gnome"
Sep 20 11:30:08 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, agreed, I think both you and akurtakov were going to put together a not of the suggested solution to send out to rcm for agreement, then I could follow up with PM and anybody else required
Sep 20 11:30:08 <ericwill>	might be related?
Sep 20 11:31:11 <ericwill>	ah, removing that entry from the source seems to fix the problem
Sep 20 11:31:13 <akurtakov>	that should be fixed with tomorrows swttools
Sep 20 11:57:01 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: what do you know about repo.eclipse.org ? eg. login accounts.. ?
Sep 20 11:59:40 <rgrunber>	hmm nvm seems to be my committer id as opposed to email.
Sep 20 12:58:13 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I am now just waiting for errata waivers that cannot do my self (secalert and releng persmissions only) :-(
Sep 20 13:34:29 <mbenitez>	mbooth, that is great [your job, not the part about waiting]
Sep 20 13:35:22 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Security guys got back pretty quickly, just need releng now
Sep 20 13:35:32 <mbenitez>	nice!
Sep 20 13:36:20 <mbenitez>	mbooth, have you tried pinging #releng ? with easy waivers sometimes anybody there can help
Sep 20 13:36:41 <mbooth>	I will give it a try
Sep 20 13:51:09 <mbenitez>	mbooth, thanks, if not just send a note to jorton / vkadlcik_gone telling them that's the only bit missing [which should happen overnight] and consider the hand off done
Sep 20 16:06:43 <nboldt1>	dumb question for mbooth mbenitez akurtakov ... if we decide on a URL from which the devstudio rpm can be installed ... and that gets codified into rhscl somehow... what's the minimum that needs to be on that URL so as to NOT cause yum to barf an error?
Sep 20 16:07:02 <nboldt1>	want to preload some URL with an empty site, then later stick in the actual rpm content etc
Sep 20 16:07:17 <nboldt1>	once I've read thru https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CreateLocalRepos and started building it
Sep 20 16:09:17 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Can you install from this URL? http://wonka.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/RHDS/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.rpm_master/20160920.1853.3800af6/
Sep 20 16:09:22 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Looks like a valid repo
Sep 20 16:09:49 <nboldt1>	as opposed to http://wonka.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/RHDS/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.rpm_master/20160920.1853.3800af6/repodata/ ?
Sep 20 16:09:50 <mbenitez>	at least temporarily that could be the POC
Sep 20 16:10:20 <nboldt1>	well, then use http://wonka.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/RHDS/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.rpm_10.0.neon/20160920.1303.9afcc44/ since that has devstudio 10.1 in it, not 10.2
Sep 20 16:10:29 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, as per the minimum I think Alex mentioned the metadata
Sep 20 16:11:00 <mbenitez>	e.g. createrepo [may work even in an empty dir, I haven't tried]
Sep 20 16:11:00 <nboldt1>	mbenitez:  you mean an empty file with nothing in it, called http://wonka.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/RHDS/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.rpm_10.0.neon/20160920.1303.9afcc44/repodata/repomd.xml ?
Sep 20 16:12:41 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, not an empty file, just run createrepo in the dir you'll share and that will create the repodata dir & content
Sep 20 16:13:12 <nboldt1>	oic
Sep 20 16:14:20 <mbenitez>	I just tried and even for an empty dir it creates content, so that's what we'd need for an empty repo
Sep 20 16:55:21 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: akurtakov mbooth: looks like this works... repodata is already produced by the build and works. http://pastebin.com/QHyvg9ma
Sep 20 16:56:21 <nboldt1>	so we just need to agree on where we want the external-facing bits to sit and I need to generate a /latest/ symlink for each build, plus enable automated snapshot/CI cleanup
Sep 20 16:56:59 <nboldt1>	so these URLs look reasonable ? (see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4054 ) or are those a blasphemy in the rhel world?
Sep 20 17:00:19 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, excellent :)
Sep 20 17:01:47 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, I don't see anything shocking in those links
Sep 20 17:04:21 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: ok, then I'll follow the existing devstudio style of links/and/nesting/of/content
Sep 20 17:04:29 *	nboldt1 goes to make the automated magic happen
Sep 20 17:05:20 <nboldt1>	um, if we agree that we want to use https://devstudio.redhat.com/10.0/staging/builds/devstudio-10.1.0.GA-build-rpm/latest/x86_64/ for the latest build of the rpm that we're willing to suggest is "probably fine but needs QE approval"
Sep 20 17:05:59 <nboldt1>	... how do we get that URL into a /etc/yum.repos.d/something.repo file so it's part of rhscl ?
Sep 20 17:07:22 <nboldt1>	and then in December when we go better-than-beta, how do we put in the URL for 10.1 or 10.2 bits?
Sep 20 17:08:02 <nboldt1>	also I guess you'd want a URL that doesn't have to change w/ each release of devstudio, right? you want one URL that will provider endusers with 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, etc.  all from the same repo. correct?

Sep 21 10:21:24 <akurtakov>	serving similar purposes as dbus-java
Sep 21 10:21:50 <akurtakov>	but this is just smth in the would-be-nice-to-have-one-day-in-the-distant-future thing :)
Sep 21 10:22:05 <rgrunber>	so there are slight issues with libmatthew on maven central side.. afaict org.abstractj.libmatthew:libunix is only the 64 bit verison.
Sep 21 10:22:53 <akurtakov>	is it same for orbit?
Sep 21 10:23:06 <rgrunber>	i'd have to see who is using it.. it isn't in Orbit.
Sep 21 10:24:08 <rgrunber>	in Fedora we get lucky because we just place the .so on the jni path so System.loadLibrary works.. in eclipse upstream land we'll have to actually make it its own osgi bundle fragment most likely.
Sep 21 10:26:22 <rgrunber>	iot.smarthome might be using it.
Sep 21 10:26:37 <rgrunber>	just imagine libmatthew in a fridge..
Sep 21 10:31:40 <rgrunber>	well they definitely use the java side.. i don't see the native so though.. https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/tree/master/bundles/io/org.eclipse.smarthome.io.transport.dbus/lib
Sep 21 10:38:45 <rgrunber>	well its not used in any feature so maybe it doesn't even work..

Sep 21 12:07:25 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Sorry for forcing you to interact with your calendar, I know how it's your favourite kind of software ;-)
Sep 21 12:09:24 <akurtakov>	I have to learn it :)
Sep 21 12:17:44 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: mbooth so this is how/what is being excluding in orbit-recipes for bcprov http://git.eclipse.org/c/orbit/orbit-recipes.git/tree/bouncycastle/org.bouncycastle.bcprov_1.52.0/pom.xml#n15
Sep 21 12:37:04 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Interesting, what was the rationale?
Sep 21 12:40:08 <rgrunber>	they don't really mention in the cqs.. you'd think someone would have asked 'why'
Sep 21 12:40:53 <akurtakov>	mbooth: there is some noise but I'll learn how to deal with this stupid calendar
Sep 21 12:42:12 <nboldt>	akurtakov: only 4 emails to schedule a call. I've seen worse. :D
Sep 21 12:42:48 <akurtakov>	nboldt: I just got used to zimbra when the move happened
Sep 21 12:43:04 <rgrunber>	mbooth: I guess for IDEA it's because a swiss firm holds the patent and has only given permission for free noncommercial use.
Sep 21 12:43:11 <nboldt>	zimbra is the worst. only thing it had going for it is better filtering. gmail sucks for that
Sep 21 12:43:29 <akurtakov>	and google calendar is huge step back, thankfully there is gnome-calendar
Sep 21 12:43:54 <nboldt>	after 5+ years of thunderbird + zimbra, moving to gmail/gcal was like catching a perfect wave and not falling off into the rocks
Sep 21 12:44:56 <rgrunber>	hmm nvm.. looks like the patents expired.. still no idea then why it's excluded.
Sep 21 12:45:30 *	mbooth waits for worldwide patent reform....
Sep 21 12:45:35 <mbooth>	Life will be easier then
Sep 21 12:46:51 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yeah it's the patent issue..
Sep 21 12:47:34 <akurtakov>	nboldt: I simply can't get the ui of google calendar and it's so unnatural to me that I fail terribly at simplest things like figuring the next meetings, could be just me not getting it :)
Sep 21 12:47:55 <rgrunber>	'I may have been able to find a workaround to an issue with the previous version'
Sep 21 12:47:58 <rgrunber>	we reviewed.  Version 1.3.5 contained some algorithms, one of which is the
Sep 21 12:48:01 <rgrunber>	symmetric cipher IDEA, which is  still patented in some countries. And while
Sep 21 12:48:03 <rgrunber>	MediaCrypt wants to make this highly secure algorithm widely available, and the
Sep 21 12:48:06 <rgrunber>	non-commercial use of this algorithm is free, whenever you or your company
Sep 21 12:48:08 <rgrunber>	sells any products or use any application which includes the IDEA algorithm for
Sep 21 12:48:11 <rgrunber>	commercial activities, in any of the countries listed below, you require a
Sep 21 12:48:13 <rgrunber>	license granted by MediaCrypt.
Sep 21 12:48:47 <nboldt>	mbooth: can you open a subtask under https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-3982 listing the places where jbt/ds plugins should be using import-package instead of require-bundle?
Sep 21 12:49:12 <nboldt>	then I can start crackin' skulls to get that fixed in devstudio 10.2 / jbt 4.4.2
Sep 21 12:49:22 <mbooth>	nboldt: Sure, thanks
Sep 21 12:50:06 <nboldt>	akurtakov: it's not just you. saw recently that google calendar includes a trash function but can't for the life of me figure out where trashed calendar events are accessed. in theory you can recover them (undelete them)
Sep 21 12:50:44 <nboldt>	and the fact that gmail's filters are applied to ALL mail in a random order, with no "stop filtering" ability or filtering sequence ... serious flaw
Sep 21 12:56:56 <mbooth>	nboldt: Hmm, did you make that version number change before I commented on Jira? I probably should actually read code before I wade in with my opinions....
Sep 21 12:57:28 <akurtakov>	nboldt: you know we have http://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/SpecfileEditor/User_Guide 
Sep 21 12:58:06 <nboldt>	mbooth: Great Minds (Think Alike) :D
Sep 21 12:58:07 <akurtakov>	with shortcut to even generate changelog entry for you - coming from the commit I looked with fixes for the day of week
Sep 21 12:59:08 <nboldt>	akurtakov: that's cool. haven't used it in ages. forgot it exists. (I mostly work in Sublime these days.)
Sep 21 12:59:49 <nboldt>	does it handle properly inserting variables from commandline? been trying to pass through stuff from build.sh -> rpmbuild but spec file refuses to see my vars
Sep 21 13:00:29 <akurtakov>	no change in this area it calls rpmbuild underneat
Sep 21 13:00:38 <nboldt>	at the end of the day it doesn't really matter so I gave up. more important is making Eclipse + devstudio start up in less than 5 mins and actually work when it's started. Waiting full minutes for Red Hat Central to appear, load, and do anything is pretty weaksauce
Sep 21 13:01:59 <mbooth>	nboldt: FWIW, you should be able to pass vars into mock
Sep 21 13:02:25 <mbooth>	E.g.: mock -r ... --define "with_extra_cheese 1"
Sep 21 13:03:04 <nboldt>	yea, that's what I tried but the syntax to then make the value of the defined var appear was not working for me
Sep 21 13:03:28 <nboldt>	%{with_extra_cheese} became %{with_extra_cheese} instead of 1
Sep 21 13:03:48 <nboldt>	some doc said to use %{-with_extra_cheese*} but that failed too
Sep 21 13:04:13 <nboldt>	tldr, wasted time and got no where... just to see about embedding the github sha in the version string
Sep 21 13:05:15 <mbooth>	Pretty annoying, oh well
Sep 21 13:08:20 <nboldt>	mbooth: well, I could always just use bash to rename the .rpm files after they're built, right? 
Sep 21 13:08:40 <nboldt>	or wait, does the version get embedded in the repodata/* files? if so, that's a big nope.
Sep 21 13:09:30 <nboldt>	mbooth: one of these days when we're bored and have nothing to do, I'd like to come up to speed more on what you do releng-wise. Want to get my hands dirtier in rpm-land
Sep 21 13:10:02 <mbooth>	nboldt: Embedded in repodata, the rpm itself...
Sep 21 13:10:16 <mbooth>	Probably not safe to rename :-)
Sep 21 13:13:26 <nboldt>	mbooth: yep. figured

Sep 22 10:04:56 <scela>	mistria: I want to investigate a bit what they are doing with the reconcilers
Sep 22 10:05:17 <mistria>	scela: I believe it's an organizational reason
Sep 22 10:05:30 <mistria>	scela: it was done by people considering themselves WTP, not Platform
Sep 22 10:05:38 <scela>	mistria: and btw, the next important thing we need to add to the editor infra is the marker support (problem warning etc.)
Sep 22 10:05:43 <scela>	mistria: ok
Sep 22 10:05:54 <scela>	mistria: have you ever played with it?
Sep 22 10:06:26 <mistria>	scela: the issue with all those SSE editors is that they require a DOM, conforming to WTP APIs
Sep 22 10:06:42 <scela>	mistria: not sure what an xml editor means, if there is no DTD
Sep 22 10:07:06 <mistria>	scela: so they parse, they put "content-types" on the tokens of the files, and you hook features to "tokens"
Sep 22 10:07:42 <scela>	mistria: not sure what 'token' and 'feature' mean in that sentence
Sep 22 10:10:12 <mistria>	scela: DTD or xsd. When there's no such schema available, WebTools editor verified tag are properly open/closed, completes according to other existing tags (infer from existing document)
Sep 22 10:10:37 <mistria>	scela" a token ~= a word or a sentence; feature = completion, hover...
Sep 22 10:10:53 <mistria>	scela: about error markers, I'm not sure it has to be in the editor
Sep 22 10:10:57 <scela>	ok
Sep 22 10:11:06 <scela>	mistria: where do they lookup for dtd/xsd?
Sep 22 10:11:12 <scela>	mistria: do they have a kind of list?
Sep 22 10:11:28 <scela>	mistria: or just check header declaration?
Sep 22 10:11:39 <mistria>	scela: for the language server, I just hook a listener on file change (or this could be a builder), which takes care of that
Sep 22 10:12:26 <mistria>	scela: they either check in the header, or for specific files such as Maven, they have the schema hardcoded or stored somewhere
Sep 22 10:13:36 <scela>	mistria: not sure why people have to depend on WTP to get this functionality
Sep 22 10:14:28 <scela>	mistria: but anyway, I can start with something minimalistic targeting some well known DTDs
Sep 22 10:15:01 <scela>	mistria: do you have handy a git repo link where this WTP xml editor is hosted?
Sep 22 10:19:41 <mbenitez>	nboldt, hi Nick, would JBDS-3984 be the main jira to track for the RPM work?
Sep 22 10:24:58 <nboldt>	mbenitez: yes, that's the one in Trello too
Sep 22 10:28:26 <mbenitez>	nboldt, should have thought about trello... thanks!
Sep 22 10:29:48 <nboldt>	mbenitez: no, it's good. don't think about trello and it won't exist :D
Sep 22 10:30:13 <nboldt>	with CDK moving to JIRA there's pretty much no reason to use trello anymore, IMHO
Sep 22 10:30:48 <mbenitez>	haha wishful thinking may work :D
Sep 22 10:31:06 <nboldt>	well, consider all the people in here who are pretending that HipChat doesn't exist?
Sep 22 10:31:12 <nboldt>	it's working for them :D
Sep 22 10:31:22 <mbenitez>	in any case we'll be using almighty soon
Sep 22 10:31:29 <nboldt>	lol, "soon"
Sep 22 10:31:40 <mbenitez>	:)
Sep 22 10:32:01 *	nboldt is reminded of that time the official release of Windows 9x was due "Real Soon Now" .. for about 3 years
Sep 22 10:32:15 <nboldt>	the release that became known as '95
Sep 22 11:33:22 <nboldt>	... but sounds like Almighty is due a lot sooner than 3 yrs :D
Sep 22 11:33:50 <nboldt>	mbooth: rgrunber: question for you in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4059
Sep 22 11:34:04 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i'm just looking.. do we need xulrunner at all ?
Sep 22 11:34:11 <nboldt>	yes
Sep 22 11:34:15 <rgrunber>	i mean we should be using webkit
Sep 22 11:34:24 <nboldt>	unless you want no visual editor in the devstudio rpm version of devstudio
Sep 22 11:34:35 <nboldt>	talk to ilya buziak about that
Sep 22 11:34:46 <nboldt>	I don't know what the degraded/improved experience would be
Sep 22 11:35:01 <nboldt>	maybe we could change this in devstudio 10.2 ? finally drop xulrunner entirely?
Sep 22 11:35:33 <nboldt>	also wondering who/how/where to get something in a .repo file added to rh-eclipse46-base so rh-eclipse46-devstudio can be discovered by yum search
Sep 22 11:35:34 <rgrunber>	things like Orbit2, gnome-vfs ring a bell maybe from back when we used xulrunner in Fedora.. so if xulrunner is needed then seems sane-ish..
Sep 22 11:36:50 <nboldt>	re: .repo stuff... https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4054 < rgrunber 
Sep 22 11:37:01 <rgrunber>	also would this clash in any way with our webkit provider.. i mean iirc the Browser code needs to select one.. and we've always assumed xulrunner was disabled.
Sep 22 11:43:48 <rgrunber>	nboldt: should probably mention to Alex next week. I think the issue in the past was that xulrunner as updating so quickly that it became difficult to support a newer version between major eclipse releases.
Sep 22 11:44:29 <rgrunber>	but if others are maintaining the support or pushing the work upstream then maybe it can work.
Sep 22 11:51:17 <mbooth>	nboldt: Re shipping a yum repo file -- we talked about this previously, IIRC there will probably be some bureaucracy to clear for that since RHEL folks might not like us shipping third-party repos
Sep 22 11:55:41 <nboldt>	mbooth: third party ? jboss is a third party to rhel?
Sep 22 11:56:27 <mbooth>	nboldt: Well, by that I mean to say it is outside the control of RHEL rel-eng, not gated by errata tool, etc
Sep 22 11:56:42 <nboldt>	ah, fair enough. :D anyway just wanted to make sure I left the next step in the right hands so it gets worked efficiently
Sep 22 11:57:10 <nboldt>	would like to mark all my rpm stuff done and hand it over the wall to the nest person, which I guess might mean opening a RH BZ? 
Sep 22 11:57:23 <nboldt>	not sure what the process / next steps are
Sep 22 11:57:38 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I don't remember what needs to happen (who to speak to) to get approval for this sort of thing
Sep 22 11:58:11 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Re above conversation about shipping a yum repo file for getting devstudio
Sep 22 11:59:12 <mbenitez>	mbooth, I think we'll need to talk to releng and get approval from PM, if you guys put together a note about the situation I can then fwd it / discuss with PM
Sep 22 12:00:17 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Okay
Sep 22 12:00:54 <mbooth>	nboldt: In the worst case, you can ship the repo file in the devstudio rpm -- it requires the user to download manually once, but they'll get updates from then on
Sep 22 12:01:06 <mbooth>	I'll put this into an email
Sep 22 12:03:08 <nboldt>	mbooth: thanks. You can start from https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4054?focusedCommentId=13296665&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13296665 for content and sample .repo file
Sep 22 12:03:33 <mbenitez>	yes please, the more details you include the best 
Sep 23 09:03:46 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff. I can see you're logged in BJ but I can't hear/see you  
Sep 23 10:09:06 <mbenitez>	PSA: company meeting on now
Sep 23 11:26:18 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: could we discuss again about https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/68530/ ? I know the bug was fixed, but the goal of the rewrite of the DockerConnection#listImages was to have it aligned with the DockerConnection#listContainers and what I liked in this method is that the 'images' field of the DockerConnection is set in the 'finally{}' block at the end of the method, which means that we would not need the local 'latestImages' variable in Docke
Sep 23 12:06:52 <lufimtse>	I'm udating org.eclipse.jdt.ui. I'm adding a '@since' tag, do I use the "Version" field from plugin.xml for the version number?
Sep 23 12:08:06 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: i think.. sort of. for @since tag you generally only need to put '@since ${major}.${minor}'
Sep 23 12:08:29 <rgrunber>	where that is the development version under which the change was introduced..
Sep 23 12:08:54 <lufimtse>	Is there a away to auto populate that thing? I tried ctrl+space
Sep 23 12:09:04 <lufimtse>	But I know sometimes it fills it in
Sep 23 12:10:17 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: well if you use an api baseline (and have issues set to show as errors), it should show be possible to add the correct version.
Sep 23 12:39:29 <lufimtse>	Does anyone know how to get hold of Dani Mergert on IRC?
Sep 23 12:39:31 <lufimtse>	is he on irc?
Sep 23 12:53:30 <rgrunber>	doesn't seem to be on eclipse-dev (at least under an alias i recognize)
Sep 23 12:53:41 <rgrunber>	daniel_megert@ch.ibm.com ?
Sep 23 15:15:56 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, that I believe is his email.
Sep 23 15:16:10 <lufimtse>	need irc or some chat handle. I've asked him.
Sep 23 15:20:17 <lufimtse>	Hmm, seems like Eclipse can now show the return value of a method call
Sep 23 15:20:18 <lufimtse>	New Eclipse feature: See return value during debugging | Coffee Oriented Programming https://coffeeorientedprogramming.com/2016/09/23/eclipse-see-return-value-during-debugging/
Sep 23 15:20:27 <lufimtse>	new-ish feature
Sep 23 15:30:58 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: yeah i have to remember to browse the milestone N&N list every now and then to see what's new.

Sep 26 10:58:27 <scela>	rgrunber: hey, thanks
Sep 26 11:01:41 <rgrunber>	scela: regarding your upcoming lucene 6.x changes, code recommenders kind of latched onto 5.x and wanted lucene-queries added as well.. so when you propose 6.x, same may happen.
Sep 26 11:03:08 <scela>	rgrunber: there were quite some breaking changes from 5 to 6
Sep 26 11:03:12 <scela>	at least on platform level
Sep 26 11:03:29 <scela>	so not sure how that would work out
Sep 26 11:03:46 <scela>	i got swamped on some platform stuff today so couldn't make it to the lucene CQs
Sep 26 11:04:02 <rgrunber>	ah ok
Sep 26 11:04:07 <scela>	rgrunber: i'll definitely start them tomorrow and will ping you to discuss them
Sep 26 11:04:21 <rgrunber>	yeah should be easy to push them this time.. no giant wait.
Sep 26 11:04:58 <scela>	rgrunber: well you're the Orbit king now so it would be a shame to wait ;)
Sep 26 11:05:18 <rgrunber>	heh, love that title.

Sep 26 12:10:40 <nboldt>	... or something like that... need more coffee I think

Sep 27 11:26:00 <akurtakov>	mistria: ^
Sep 27 11:32:37 <mistria>	akurtakov: yes, it could be used for that purpose
Sep 27 11:32:48 <mistria>	akurtakov: I don't remember we already discussed it on bugzilla
Sep 27 11:33:05 <akurtakov>	ok, I needed an entry point for the whole thing
Sep 27 11:33:18 <mistria>	akurtakov: then this one could be fine I guess
Sep 27 11:33:34 <akurtakov>	yup, just fine
Sep 27 11:33:52 <mistria>	akurtakov: I can start the discussion here and include LSP4J project leads
Sep 27 11:34:04 <mistria>	akurtakov: would putting the LSP extensions in LSP4J work for you?
Sep 27 11:34:12 <akurtakov>	should be fine
Sep 27 11:34:45 <akurtakov>	only concern being implying xtext on everyone

Sep 28 10:37:39 <akurtakov_>	mistria: the one from swt
Sep 28 10:37:41 <akurtakov_>	:)
Sep 28 10:40:41 <scela>	mistria: CTabFolderRenderer IIRC
Sep 28 10:41:27 <scela>	rgrunber: so akurtakov_ is saying https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt and https://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt should be kind of equivalents to our CLAs
Sep 28 10:42:07 <rgrunber>	yes, but do contributors actually sign them ?
Sep 28 10:42:25 <akurtakov_>	rgrunber: it's a must have for apache projects
Sep 28 10:42:37 <akurtakov_>	in the same way eclipse cla is for eclipse projects IIRC
Sep 28 10:42:39 <rgrunber>	i mean even in their contribution guidelines i didn't see anything like 'please make sure you sign this'
Sep 28 10:46:08 <rgrunber>	k, you may be right..
Sep 28 10:46:10 <akurtakov_>	rgrunber: http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html
Sep 28 10:46:10 <rgrunber>	https://www.apache.org/licenses/
Sep 28 10:46:24 <akurtakov_>	from it A committer is a developer that was given write access to the code repository and has a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file
Sep 28 10:47:11 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I had to sign it at my previous job -- pretty sure its mandatory
Sep 28 10:47:51 <scela>	bottom line I include these two links in the box
Sep 28 10:47:59 <scela>	akurtakov_: rgrunber ^ ?
Sep 28 10:48:02 <rgrunber>	k then the option should be that is has one im place
Sep 28 10:48:15 <rgrunber>	in*
Sep 28 10:48:26 <akurtakov_>	I agree
Sep 28 10:48:53 <akurtakov_>	fwiw, everytime you face apache project and has question look for smth similar to eclipse :)
Sep 28 10:49:05 <akurtakov_>	for the organizational part I mean
Sep 28 10:49:43 <mbooth>	apache.org in some ways is worse for bureaucracy
Sep 28 10:50:03 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: hmm, how so ?
Sep 28 10:50:38 <mbooth>	Hmm, actually, that might not be true since I never served on PMC for eclipse.org project, I cannot compare
Sep 28 10:51:00 <mbooth>	I realised I compared apache PMC versus eclipse Commiter :-)
Sep 28 10:52:46 <akurtakov_>	well, apache pmc has the duti of eclipse pmc and project leads
Sep 28 10:52:49 <akurtakov_>	AFAIK
Sep 28 10:53:09 <akurtakov_>	but overall not much of a difference :)
Sep 28 10:55:05 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: are you still active on some apache project?
Sep 28 10:55:33 <scela>	rgrunber: so I filled up the whole thing, clicked submit and it said 'no logged in user'
Sep 28 10:55:46 <scela>	rgrunber: all filled data was also lost
Sep 28 10:57:01 <mbooth>	akurtakov_: I am on the pmc for one small and mostly inactive project. I keep trying to get it terminated since the sponsoring organisation lost interest in it and many of the original committers moved on
Sep 28 10:57:25 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: which one?
Sep 28 10:57:46 <mbooth>	akurtakov_: http://bloodhound.apache.org/
Sep 28 10:57:52 <akurtakov_>	ah the trac clone :0

Sep 28 13:07:32 <lufimtse>	Is the etherpad for agile thing up yet?
Sep 28 13:08:03 <lufimtse>	This guy? http://eclipse.etherpad.corp.redhat.com/sprint-planning
Sep 28 13:09:08 <rgrunber>	that's the one.
Sep 28 13:09:25 <lufimtse>	kk
Sep 28 13:53:18 <rgrunber>	mbooth: so with just installing devstudio + whatever else it depends on, and then removing bundles mentioned, it's down to 38s .. and according to profiler, 30s are just in reconciler's Activator.start.
Sep 28 16:04:50 <lufimtse>	@all, is there any code in platfom.ui that does different things depending on underlying OS?
Sep 28 16:04:57 <lufimtse>	(in general...)
Sep 28 16:05:06 <lufimtse>	or is there a rule to be consistent?
Sep 28 16:05:21 <lufimtse>	Well, I suppose there is the CSS engine... ?
Sep 28 16:07:02 <rgrunber>	well there might be to some extent.. i do see references to isLinux/isWindows
Sep 28 16:07:35 <rgrunber>	references to GTK
Sep 28 16:08:05 <lufimtse>	ok, thanks, that's what I was looking for.
Sep 28 16:09:13 <rgrunber>	just do a grep for GTK (or IS_GTK, WS_GTK for more specific things).. though honestly there aren't that many

Sep 29 03:08:31 <mistria>	scela: I don't know

Sep 29 03:08:53 <mistria>	scela: let him have a look
Sep 29 03:11:22 <mistria>	scela: I think the pattern of reports with this suite is <pluginId>.xml
Sep 29 03:11:32 <mistria>	scela: that's the JUnit report that seems missing
Sep 29 03:12:48 <scela>	mistria: but he's saying the tests weren't run at all

Sep 30 04:56:48 <scela>	https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.text.git/tree/org.eclipse.ui.genericeditor.tests/test.xml?id=4de07cf7328f19fab490c4c93b34aca5ef00c30b
Sep 30 04:56:57 <scela>	mistria: line 32
Sep 30 04:57:17 <scela>	should be org.eclipse.ui.genericeditor.tests.GenericEditorTestSuite
Sep 30 04:57:21 <scela>	this is probably the issue
Sep 30 04:57:24 <scela>	preparing a gerrit
Sep 30 04:57:32 <mistria>	scela: ok
Sep 30 04:57:42 <mistria>	scela: I did th epatch and Sravan approved it ;)
Sep 30 04:57:49 <mistria>	scela: so I'm half culprit
Sep 30 04:58:06 <scela>	mistria: haha it's fine, i'll wrap it up for good
Sep 30 04:58:49 <akurtakov_>	the whole test infra + tests needs an update to bring it back to sanity
Sep 30 04:59:01 <akurtakov_>	but this requires dedicated resourses which we don't have
Sep 30 05:14:50 <scela>	mistria: what do you mean by "* Content-type/editor association could be included in the template." in the pde template bug?
Sep 30 05:17:28 <mistria>	scela: the template should associate the content-type with the generic editor
Sep 30 05:19:01 <scela>	mistria: to open it by default with the generic editor you mean?
Sep 30 05:19:12 <mistria>	scela: yes
Sep 30 05:19:20 <mistria>	scela: I'm trying to find the extension point name
Sep 30 05:21:59 <scela>	mistria: in org.eclipse.ui.editors you can add a contenttypebinding to an editor
Sep 30 05:22:12 <scela>	mistria: the right-click-new way
Sep 30 05:22:42 <scela>	mistria: but the o.e.ui.editors is mostly for new editors
Sep 30 05:22:48 <mistria>	scela: yes
Sep 30 05:22:59 <mistria>	scela: there's an "overrideEditorAssociation" IIRC
Sep 30 05:23:29 <mistria>	scela: there it is: http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fextension-points%2Forg_eclipse_ui_ide_editorAssociationOverride.html
Sep 30 05:24:27 <scela>	mistria: then it needs an additional dep on o.e.ui.ide
Sep 30 05:24:46 <mistria>	scela: not very elegant as contributing directly an association, but it can be enough
Sep 30 05:25:33 <scela>	mistria: yeah but we need this way as our whole thing is based on not providing a separate editor, rather 'enriching' it with this stuff
Sep 30 05:25:59 <mistria>	scela: right
Sep 30 05:26:10 <mistria>	scela: i think that's the best we can do for now
Sep 30 05:26:27 <mistria>	scela: I'm opening the bug to just add a binding to org.eclipse.ui.ediitors
Sep 30 05:27:01 <scela>	mistria: but also that one needs a new editor to get there
Sep 30 05:28:32 <mistria>	scela: I don't think so, in IEditorAssociationOverride it's just returning EditorDescriptions, not necessarily creating some
Sep 30 05:29:33 <scela>	mistria: ok. we really need to simplify this. I'm even thinking whether it makes sense to include it like this in the PDE template.
Sep 30 05:30:06 <mistria>	scela: yup
Sep 30 05:30:24 <mistria>	scela: I think it makes sense for now
Sep 30 05:33:43 <mistria>	scela: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=502837
Sep 30 05:44:59 <scela>	mistria: will you be able to look at it?
Sep 30 05:45:11 <scela>	akurtakov_: ^ it's pretty important :)
Sep 30 05:45:22 <mistria>	scela: yes
Sep 30 05:45:32 <scela>	mistria: ok
Sep 30 05:45:55 <scela>	mistria: I'll take care of the other issues related to the template in the meantime. hopefully you'll be done by then and I can use the new way.
Sep 30 05:47:13 <akurtakov_>	scela: I hope I understand it :0
Sep 30 05:48:17 <mistria>	scela: I think you'll be much faster than me
Sep 30 05:48:20 <scela>	akurtakov_: basically now you can't redefine a contentType-Editor relationship without defining a new editor in the process
Sep 30 05:48:27 <mistria>	scela: the extension will require review and agreement
Sep 30 05:48:32 <mistria>	scela: as it's public API
Sep 30 05:48:42 <mistria>	scela: the template won't require much
Sep 30 05:49:00 <scela>	mistria: yeah probably
Sep 30 05:49:12 <mistria>	scela: IMO, you should go on with the editorOverride, and once there is the extension, we'll make another iteration to use it
Sep 30 06:51:44 <scela>	akurtakov_: do we have an IM channel on Sravan?
Sep 30 06:51:58 <akurtakov_>	scela: google talk 
Sep 30 06:51:59 <akurtakov_>	why?
Sep 30 06:52:57 <scela>	akurtakov_: ah, he just reacted https://git.eclipse.org/r/82245
Sep 30 06:53:16 <akurtakov_>	scela: https://plus.google.com/u/0/108469574010541799130
Sep 30 06:54:24 <akurtakov_>	I wonder can't this test stuff rely on some annotation and a procesor which gets what to run based on it instead of hardcoding that way in a place only releng can touch
Sep 30 06:56:37 <scela>	akurtakov_: oh there are many ways to do this better, once you have the resources for it :)
Sep 30 06:56:47 <scela>	akurtakov_: up to know it has been David's magic potion
Sep 30 09:03:37 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: i think he's saying it's a rhel7 issue :P
Sep 30 09:03:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, this happened last week too
Sep 30 09:04:05 <rgrunber>	[X] Add heavy wind effect to all voice conversations
Sep 30 10:21:34 <scela>	mistria: here it goes .. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=502565
Sep 30 10:24:03 <scela>	mistria: nice to see people are starting to consume and trying to improve it already
Sep 30 10:34:11 <mistria>	scela: so wha'ts missing to close thise bug, a N&N entrt?
Sep 30 11:42:29 <scela>	mistria: the one i referenced is a different one, it's a request from angelo zerr
Sep 30 14:52:56 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I am trying to use Docker exec to do a simple ls on an existing running Container...when I try and read the LogStream that execStart returns, I keep getting an exception on hasNext() because it reads a set amount of bytes and reaches EOF before the expected amount which is some ridiculous high number
Sep 30 14:53:15 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I believe you were seeing this with LogThread a long time ago...do you remember what the issue was?
Sep 30 14:53:54 <rgrunber>	yes, it was that there was no support in docker-client for using readFully() or something.. let me get the commit..
Sep 30 14:54:46 <rgrunber>	ahh .. is tty enabled when you do this ?
Sep 30 14:54:59 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: yes
Sep 30 14:55:10 <rgrunber>	https://github.com/spotify/docker-client/commit/824af851013d95ff5bdf26d05241c035191d496c
Sep 30 14:55:27 <rgrunber>	it made 3.6.0
Sep 30 14:55:36 <rgrunber>	but we'r still using an older version
Sep 30 14:56:34 <jjohnstn>	thanks for the info
Sep 30 14:56:57 <rgrunber>	a bit of a pain to get it working properly until we update.
Sep 30 15:48:05 <lufimtse>	I noticed that "Require-Bundle" has an upper version of '4.0.0'. Why is that?
Sep 30 15:48:07 <lufimtse>	ex:  org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor;bundle-version="[3.10.0,4.0.0)",
Sep 30 15:48:25 <lufimtse>	why not just ="3.10.0" and leave it open ended?
Sep 30 16:07:33 <lufimtse>	 Is it so that when api breakage occurs, the main author would know about it?
Sep 30 16:13:02 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: yeah, so major version changes are permitted to break API.. and it guards against that.
Sep 30 16:13:17 <lufimtse>	Ok.
Sep 30 16:13:19 <lufimtse>	Thansk.
Sep 30 16:14:22 <rgrunber>	if it were open.. ie 3.10.0 or above, people would see it as that bundle saying it commits to support other versions above.. so if it didn't people would complain/file bugs.

Oct 03 09:29:23 <scela>	mistria: any idea?
Oct 03 09:29:31 <scela>	akurtakov_: what gtk version does this instance have?
Oct 03 09:29:39 <mistria>	scela: nope
Oct 03 09:29:41 <akurtakov_>	I think 3.14
Oct 03 09:29:49 <mistria>	scela: didn't Dani just say tests are ok now?
Oct 03 09:29:59 <scela>	mistria: no
Oct 03 09:30:10 <scela>	mistria: he said the releng tests are ok
Oct 03 09:30:17 <scela>	mistria: the bundleshape dir thing
Oct 03 09:30:25 <mistria>	scela: "The Releng test no longer failed."
Oct 03 09:30:51 <scela>	mistria: he means https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497871#c46
Oct 03 09:30:59 <mistria>	ok
Oct 03 09:33:51 <xcoulon>	mistria: hello ! Do you know if it is possible to pgrammatically disable the launchbar ? I'm not sure how to use it with SWTBot so I'd rather use the standard/legacy toolbar instead.
Oct 03 09:34:38 <mistria>	xcoulon: I've never used the launchbar nor ever integrated it nor ever read its code... sorry I can't help
Oct 03 09:35:01 <xcoulon>	mistria: ok, thanks anyway
Oct 03 09:35:25 <mistria>	xcoulon: but if you look at the code of the Customize Perspective dialog, you may find out how to do it
Oct 03 09:35:38 <xcoulon>	mistria: ok
Oct 03 10:00:06 <scela>	lufimtse: would there be any important fix between gtk 3.14 and 3.20 related to hovers?
Oct 03 10:00:30 <scela>	lufimtse: we have a test failing in 3.14 but not in 3.20 which tests hovers
Oct 03 10:00:58 <lufimtse>	scela, hey
Oct 03 10:01:33 <lufimtse>	swt doesn't have hovers. Has tooltips?
Oct 03 10:01:51 <lufimtse>	there were lots of fixes, kinda hard to tell which could affect
Oct 03 10:01:54 <lufimtse>	which test case?
Oct 03 10:02:31 <scela>	lufimtse: yeah we call that hover in the p.ui/text level so it sticks to your mind
Oct 03 10:03:24 <scela>	lufimtse: can you access https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.text.git/commit/?id=5bcb7ac5045743f9ec17895a9a12318dd90ea4cb ?
Oct 03 10:03:33 <scela>	for some reason it says no repo found for me
Oct 03 10:03:38 <scela>	probably the infra is fried again
Oct 03 10:03:59 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.text.git
Oct 03 10:04:00 <lufimtse>	works ^
Oct 03 10:04:10 <scela>	https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.text.git/tree/org.eclipse.ui.genericeditor.tests/src/org/eclipse/ui/genericeditor/tests/HoverTest.java
Oct 03 10:04:13 <scela>	lufimtse: ^
Oct 03 10:04:36 <lufimtse>	leemmee see.
Oct 03 10:05:17 <scela>	lufimtse: https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/ep47N-unit-cen64/ws/workarea/N20161002-2000/eclipse-testing/results/html/org.eclipse.ui.genericeditor.tests_ep47N-unit-cen64_linux.gtk.x86_64_8.0.html is the failure trace
Oct 03 10:13:17 <lufimtse>	scela, for me, works on gtk3.18, Gtk3.16
Oct 03 10:13:22 <lufimtse>	test case
Oct 03 10:13:31 <lufimtse>	I can't seem to make it fail?
Oct 03 10:13:58 <lufimtse>	in gtk there were position fixes related to tooltips I think,
Oct 03 10:14:11 <lufimtse>	Lemme know.
Oct 03 10:16:10 <scela>	lufimtse: ok thanks for taking a look
Oct 03 10:51:54 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: hipp issue should be resolved.
Oct 03 10:52:36 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: great ! and I just realized that I opened the issue with my personal account, not Red Hat's one. Bah..
Oct 03 10:52:59 <xcoulon>	so how was the problem solved ? Did CDT just publish new artifacts ?
Oct 03 10:53:40 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: that's my guess. referencing something on a hudson hipp i still see as kinda dangerous.. especially because it can disappear from things like "clean workspace" or whatnot.
Oct 03 10:54:12 <rgrunber>	it didn't say 'repository not found' so it located it at some point.. and when it tried retrieving the metadata, it failed.. could have even been a networking issue.
Oct 03 10:54:15 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I agree, but I'm not sure how it happened at the beginning, to be honest
Oct 03 10:54:35 <xcoulon>	ha ok, thanks for the explanation
Oct 03 10:54:51 <rgrunber>	i don't know if cdt offers a nightly of launchbar.. but they do offer the feature for neon.1 and i've pointed to it in the bug.
Oct 03 10:55:45 <rgrunber>	but tbh, if the issue is back to normal and happens rarely i'm fine with keeping the repo, for now.
Oct 03 10:55:58 <rgrunber>	*offers a nightly of launchbar no on the hipp.
Oct 03 11:05:15 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, I think it's the first time this happens, actually
