Jul 26 05:53:13 <PiyushB>	akurtakov, around ?
Jul 26 06:13:55 <PiyushB>	trying to get this eclipse 3.2 running, not sure where issue is... http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/395942
Jul 26 06:20:13 <mbooth>	"[root@ESMAD7IV04 ~]# eclipse"
Jul 26 06:20:35 <mbooth>	PiyushB: Did you mean to run Eclipse as root?
Jul 26 06:20:47 <mbooth>	It's generally not a good idea
Jul 26 06:20:57 <PiyushB>	mbooth, yes its root
Jul 26 06:21:34 <akurtakov>	PiyushB: that's not supported 
Jul 26 06:21:45 <akurtakov>	in later versions we added code to actually prevent it
Jul 26 06:21:50 <akurtakov>	mbooth: good catch
Jul 26 06:22:12 <akurtakov>	PiyushB: once you run it as root it will screw its metadata (on ancient versions)

Jul 26 06:23:04 <akurtakov>	PiyushB: running as root once it will screw for non-root too
Jul 26 06:23:26 <akurtakov>	please uninstall eclipse, make sure there is nothing left in libdir/eclipse
Jul 26 06:23:28 <mbooth>	PiyushB: There's a good chance you will need to re-install it since the master p2 profile might be screwed
Jul 26 06:23:36 <akurtakov>	install again and try again as non root

Jul 26 12:26:35 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff ! I'm running the maven build on master branch for the Docker tooling (after pulling the latest changes) and I have 3 or 4 errors (depending on the build). Do you have the same results locally ? 
Jul 26 12:26:42 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: welcome back :)
Jul 26 12:26:55 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks !
Jul 26 12:27:33 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: sorry, I did not see you online when writing the message to Jeff. I guess I read too fast the list of online pple
Jul 26 12:27:45 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: yes, welcome...I haven't seen any build errors in hudson
Jul 26 12:28:04 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok.. damn'it.. 
Jul 26 12:28:15 <rgrunber>	what kind of error (test, building, ..)
Jul 26 12:28:29 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: rgrunber: test failures, actually
Jul 26 12:28:37 <xcoulon>	Tests in error:
Jul 26 12:28:37 <xcoulon>	  BuildDockerImageShortcutSWTBotTest.shouldDisableCommandOnFirstCallWhenMissingConnection:99 » WidgetNotFound
Jul 26 12:28:37 <xcoulon>	  EditDockerConnectionSWTBotTest.shouldUpdateLaunchConfigurationWhenConnectionNameChanged:349->configureRunImageLaunchConfiguration:146 » ClassCast
Jul 26 12:28:37 <xcoulon>	  ImageRunSWTBotTest.shouldReportErrorIfContainerWithSameNameExists:97 » Timeout
Jul 26 12:29:10 <xcoulon>	but I see that there's a new dialog saying that there's no connection, asking to create a new one, and I suspect it might cause some issue with SWTBot
Jul 26 12:29:23 <xcoulon>	issue or side effect, to be more accurate
Jul 26 12:29:56 <jjohnstn>	yes, that would make sense
Jul 26 12:30:51 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok, so before pushing a new version of my work for issue 496922 (I changed my code after your review), I'll probably submit a fix for the test failures. ok for you ?
Jul 26 12:31:12 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: yes, that's fine
Jul 26 12:31:44 <rgrunber>	there's a new dialog for build launch shortcut that links to new connection wizard if no connections exist at all.
Jul 26 12:31:49 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: rgrunber: do you remember which issue/patch brought this dialog ? 
Jul 26 12:32:25 <rgrunber>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/77638/
Jul 26 12:32:59 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: Meeting tomorrow will be 30min earlier
Jul 26 12:34:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks !
Jul 26 12:38:23 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: jjohnstn: may I ask.. should the shell be labelled "No Docker connection exists" (singular) or "No Docker connections exist" (plural) ? 
Jul 26 12:38:59 <xcoulon>	because we have both singular and plural messages and I wonder if both are valid in English ;-)
Jul 26 12:40:21 <rgrunber>	both seem right to me.. i guess i went with "no docker connections exist" though..
Jul 26 12:40:51 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: ok, thanks for clarifying. I'll probably rename the other label to be consistent with your, then
Jul 26 12:40:53 <rgrunber>	technically i think "no docker connecion exists" is better since the requirement is that at least one be present..
Jul 26 12:41:02 <xcoulon>	ha ok
Jul 26 12:41:09 <xcoulon>	so I'll edit it, then

Jul 26 12:43:52 <akurtakov>	doing that in the swt.binaries repo will rebuild the natives and put them in the proper places

Jul 26 13:38:50 <mbenitez>	nboldt, hi Nick! thanks for being so involved in the conversations :)
Jul 26 13:39:35 <mbenitez>	nboldt, re: the rpm work, we'll have a planning mtg tomorrow to get some more details into what we expect to achieve when, let's go from there
Jul 26 13:42:28 <nboldt>	mbenitez: excellent, thanks
Jul 26 13:42:46 <mbenitez>	np!
Jul 26 13:42:58 <nboldt>	btw, I use pidgin so if you ever see I'm not on IRC it could be because pidgin has silently crashed (often when VPN goes down)
Jul 26 13:43:14 <nboldt>	in that case, there's email/hipchat as backup :D
Jul 26 13:43:16 <mbenitez>	tomorrow we can find a victim ^W volunteer to help you :)
Jul 26 13:43:44 <nboldt>	I thought the victim was Matt Booth, as thrown into the volcano by akurtakov
Jul 26 13:44:03 <nboldt>	mbooth: ^
Jul 26 13:44:18 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thanks for letting me know, I believe in letting people be offline so if there was something that needed your attention I'll send a note for sure
Jul 26 13:44:31 <mbooth>	:-)
Jul 26 13:44:52 <akurtakov>	my bad, I miscalculated that rhscl alpha deadline is friday
Jul 26 13:44:53 <mbenitez>	nboldt, yes, Mat will help you, he's just been super busy preparing the dts/rhscl hand off for this Friday
Jul 26 13:45:14 <nboldt>	mbenitez: cool. could also be that I'm on another screen and not seeing the chihuahua-like blinking pidgin cursor notifying me of @mentions
Jul 26 13:45:31 <mbenitez>	haha
Jul 26 13:45:35 <akurtakov>	nboldt: I'll let other things aside and try to have simple spec file for usage tomorrow
Jul 26 13:45:53 <nboldt>	hey, no worries. we still have 6 weeks before devstudio has to be done for the next GA release ... two more sprints to go
Jul 26 13:46:05 <mbenitez>	nboldt, if you have specific questions at any point don't hesitate to just throw them here, anyone who's done pkg work will help
Jul 26 13:46:48 <akurtakov>	hmm, rgrunber is too calm when we speak for howto generate droplets :)
Jul 26 13:46:59 <nboldt>	I guess I need to get a vm with Fedora24 on it (currently do most work on F20) so I can actually use the rpm? what's your toolset for working with rpms and specfiles? (I think I've used the Eclipse specfile editor once.)
Jul 26 13:48:15 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: if that was calm.. imagine how i feel now that i'm discovering all these minor bugs.
Jul 26 13:49:03 <akurtakov>	nboldt: f24 is a prereq yes
Jul 26 13:50:07 <nboldt>	damn. OK. I'll go find an .iso and more disk space
Jul 26 13:50:10 <rgrunber>	mbooth: btw do you remember when we had a discussion with jeff about cdt not symlinking some thing (maybe lpg-java).. and we both agreed on something.. then never spoke of it again.
Jul 26 13:50:37 <nboldt>	...and some free time to set it up... and to migrate my ~/ folder to it... *sigh*
Jul 26 13:51:46 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Erm... now you're really quizzing me...
Jul 26 13:52:06 *	mbooth tries to remember what he had for breakfast...
Jul 26 13:52:22 <rgrunber>	mbooth: that convo is the reason i now set autolog on
Jul 26 13:52:42 <mbenitez>	nboldt, fun times :) if you need anything [other than time] let me know
Jul 26 13:52:54 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I'm sure there's a million entries if I grep my logs for "symlink" :-(
Jul 26 13:53:43 <rgrunber>	hmm maybe cdt.. jjohnstn , long story short cdt-parsers stuff is not started because symlink to lpg-java isn't in any of the cdt plugins/ folders
Jul 26 13:54:02 <rgrunber>	yet the 'requires' exist in the rpm metadata..
Jul 26 13:54:42 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Hmm, actually I remember a conversation about freemarker...
Jul 26 13:54:52 <mbooth>	Or was that something different
Jul 26 13:55:14 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i fixed freemarker according to the commits..
Jul 26 13:55:20 <rgrunber>	for arduino
Jul 26 13:56:21 <rgrunber>	umm nvm can't find it but i fixed some symlinks..
Jul 26 13:58:27 <rgrunber>	anyways it looks like i'd have to debug fedoraproject-p2 or at least rebuild with -X to figure out why symlink is not generated.. so just wanted to see if anyone remembered the convo before i go down that rabbit hole.
Jul 26 14:07:21 <mbenitez>	akazakov, hi Alexey, I updated the calendar invite for tomorrow, I added those who've been in the conversation so far, let me know if I missed anybody or just go ahead and add them
Jul 26 14:07:49 <akazakov>	mbenitez, thanks!
Jul 26 14:07:59 <akazakov>	I also added Jeff.
Jul 26 14:08:18 <mbenitez>	sounds good :)
Jul 26 14:10:09 <mbenitez>	akazakov, re: mailing list I can subscribe people [I think] could you please just email me the names?
Jul 26 14:10:35 <akazakov>	mbenitez, sure
Jul 26 14:17:16 <akazakov>	mbenitez, sent the list

Jul 26 15:54:23 <nboldt>	hey, dumb question... any recommendations for a better IRC client that works on both fedora and windows10?
Jul 26 15:54:39 <ericwill>	nboldt I think Hexchat is Linux and Windows
Jul 26 15:58:29 <nboldt>	ericwill: but is it good? can it hold channels open persistently even if i minimize them? @notifications? logging? 
Jul 26 16:00:31 <nboldt>	ah, I see that's a yes for autoconnect & join on startup
Jul 26 16:01:01 <ericwill>	nboldt yup, should do all of that
Jul 26 16:01:27 <ericwill>	minimizes to the tray and will show a balloon notification when you get pinged
Jul 26 16:02:12 <rgrunber>	is that fancy windows bash thing good enough to run irssi ? :P
Jul 26 16:02:47 <nboldt>	maaybe
Jul 26 16:02:57 <nboldt>	otherwise there's cygwin, mingw, git bash, ...
Jul 26 16:03:34 <nboldt>	and that embedded linux bash thing *cough* ubuntu */cough*
Jul 26 16:05:05 <lufimtse>	nboldt, I haven't tried Hexchat on Windows, but works well on linux OS.g_object_get (settings, WebKitGTK.geometry, geometry, 0);
Jul 26 16:05:12 <lufimtse>	^ https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html
Jul 26 16:05:18 <lufimtse>	wrong clipboard content lol.
Jul 26 16:05:29 <nboldt>	lol, thannks

Jul 27 09:26:46 <mbenitez>	xcoulon, hi, Jeff is on pto until next Tuesday
Jul 27 09:27:21 <xcoulon>	mbenitez: ha ok… I saw him online and I did not know he was on PTO
Jul 27 09:27:36 <xcoulon>	mbenitez: thanks
Jul 27 09:27:52 <mbenitez>	xcoulon, yes :) that is very confusing, Roland should be in soon, maybe he can help you

Jul 27 09:59:20 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: hello Roland. Would you mind giving a look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77972/ ? 
Jul 27 09:59:53 <xcoulon>	also, I sent a couple of mails this morning but we should discuss about them when Jeff comes back from PTO. Ok for you ?
Jul 27 10:01:56 <rgrunber>	was just about to send email, basically http://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs_2#Evolving_API_interfaces_-_API_methods
Jul 27 10:05:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks for the link. But from my understanding, adding a method in IDockerConnectionSettingsFinder breaks the compatibility, right ?
Jul 27 10:08:40 <rgrunber>	exception is if it doesn't need to be implemented by clients then it's only breaking source compatibility or contract compatibility.
Jul 27 10:09:17 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: how does this method addition changes from what I proposed in my patches ?
Jul 27 10:09:25 <rgrunber>	i could just make it internal and not expose it at all.
Jul 27 10:09:31 <xcoulon>	s/changes/change/
Jul 27 10:10:12 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: what I'm trying to understand is if this is a valid addition or not, since all my proposals were rejected.
Jul 27 10:11:50 <rgrunber>	we'll find some way around getting the change in... worst case we just have to not expose any new methods through the interface.
Jul 27 10:12:44 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: "we'll find some way around getting the change in... " <- ok, fine. Then we can do the same on IDockerConnection and IDockerImage, ok ?
Jul 27 10:13:55 <rgrunber>	we can do the same thing.. just not add them to the public api for 5.1
Jul 27 10:14:10 <xcoulon>	ok

Jul 27 12:42:21 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I think you'll want to skip all the changes in the SWTBot tests, it's really a matter of dealing with all the new connection created by the new extension points that you added
Jul 27 12:48:39 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_mtg4: mbenitez: akazakov akurtakov: would a better name for the "A" RPM be devstudio-root? 
Jul 27 12:48:57 <nboldt>	or devstudio-stem?
Jul 27 12:49:08 <akurtakov>	what's "A"
Jul 27 12:49:13 <akurtakov>	the shared one ?
Jul 27 12:49:17 <nboldt>	yes
Jul 27 12:49:25 <nboldt>	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EguQBtlIOXCz5CGCoAO3MEWDnNXITv0st6dhIk8Cwac/edit# scroll to near the bottom
Jul 27 12:49:47 <mbenitez>	I like the root idea but shouldn't it be eclipse? since it's platform
Jul 27 12:50:00 <mbenitez>	+ other common components
Jul 27 12:50:05 <nboldt>	right... 
Jul 27 12:50:08 <akurtakov>	that's implementation detail, which comes from the scl metapackage
Jul 27 12:50:11 <nboldt>	so devstudio-eclipse-common ?
Jul 27 12:50:35 <nboldt>	akurtakov: I know it's an implementation detail, I'm just wondering what the best name for it would be 
Jul 27 12:50:44 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, agreed that it's implementation detail, I think nboldt just wants to clarify
Jul 27 12:50:54 <mbenitez>	and it would help so we all know what we're talking about
Jul 27 12:50:59 <nboldt>	(contrary to popular belief I do more than just meetings/minutes and creation of trello cards)
Jul 27 12:51:05 <mbenitez>	haha
Jul 27 12:51:06 <akurtakov>	well, as scls prepend
Jul 27 12:51:18 <akurtakov>	the scl name
Jul 27 12:51:52 <akurtakov>	it will be rh-eclipse46-smth
Jul 27 12:52:01 <nboldt>	ah
Jul 27 12:52:04 <akurtakov>	I see that mbooth went for https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/buildinfo?buildID=505275
Jul 27 12:52:09 <akurtakov>	aka rh-eclipse46-base
Jul 27 12:52:15 <mbenitez>	that smth could be root
Jul 27 12:52:24 <nboldt>	could be smdh too :D
Jul 27 12:52:40 <mbooth>	It can still change :-)
Jul 27 12:52:46 <mbenitez>	nboldt, this is the meta rpm for eclipse currently https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/buildinfo?buildID=505275
Jul 27 12:52:48 <nboldt>	because I do that a lot these days when I'm asking about base/common/commons/foundation/root/stem/underpinning/stuff-below
Jul 27 12:52:50 <akurtakov>	BUT we can add Provides: devstudio-common-common and etc.
Jul 27 12:53:13 <akurtakov>	so `yum install devstudio-eclipse-common` still works 
Jul 27 12:53:16 <mbooth>	Currently: "rh-eclipse46" -> installs everything in the SCL / "rh-eclipse46-base" -> installs only things shared by the SCL and DevStudio
Jul 27 12:53:26 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks for the patch review !
Jul 27 12:53:39 <mbenitez>	mbooth, nice
Jul 27 12:53:40 <xcoulon>	I marked the issue as resolved/fixed
Jul 27 12:54:00 <akurtakov>	nboldt: ah, so you're on to clarifying things 
Jul 27 12:54:06 *	akurtakov thought of user experience
Jul 27 12:54:20 <mbooth>	But if you prefer it to be called something other than "...-base" now is the time :-)
Jul 27 12:54:55 <nboldt>	yeah, that's why I'm bringing it up
Jul 27 12:55:08 <nboldt>	to avoid "which base do you mean?" questions
Jul 27 12:55:20 <mbenitez>	could it be something like IDE?
Jul 27 12:55:32 <akurtakov>	so we make it which ide :)
Jul 27 12:55:48 <akurtakov>	I tried to stick to shared(components) but it didn't work better
Jul 27 12:55:56 <akurtakov>	kind of lost hope to clarify this one
Jul 27 12:56:13 <mbenitez>	well, it's rh-eclipse-ide...
Jul 27 12:56:25 <mbenitez>	but base is fine with me
Jul 27 12:57:54 <mbooth>	akurtakov: It could be rh-eclipse46-shared-components, if you like your RPM names nice and descriptive ;-)
Jul 27 12:58:20 <akurtakov>	mbooth: well, I read the %description usually :)
Jul 27 12:58:34 <akurtakov>	it's not me that cares about this one :)
Jul 27 12:59:08 <mbenitez>	actually, if the default is to install only the common stuff that should be rh-eclipse46
Jul 27 12:59:39 <mbenitez>	then instead of a base we'd have an rh-eclipse-all or linux or such
Jul 27 12:59:46 <mbooth>	I mean, it's pretty academic, because the devstudio RPM would just have Requires: rh-eclipse46-whatever-we-call-it and users will never see it
Jul 27 13:01:22 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I dislike going against the established convention of what you get when you install the unadorned "rh-eclipse46" package (do we want to have different behaviour to other SCLs?)
Jul 27 13:02:31 <mbenitez>	mbooth, agreed on not going against convention, where will the devstudio rpm live?
Jul 27 13:02:41 <mbenitez>	rh-eclipse46-devstudio?
Jul 27 13:04:14 <mbooth>	Good question...
Jul 27 13:04:44 <mbenitez>	I think once we figure that we can get the names straight
Jul 27 13:05:03 <mbooth>	If it's not shipping as part of the SCL, it doesn't need to have the rh-eclipse46 prefix
Jul 27 13:05:20 <mbenitez>	if it is inside the collection [which I think makes sense] then the meta will install it too
Jul 27 13:05:59 <mbenitez>	if it's not inside the collection it would be another collection, in theory a separate channel...
Jul 27 13:07:15 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Can we ship binary-only rpms through a RHEL channel?
Jul 27 13:07:17 <mbenitez>	the idea is to ship an 'eclipse product' with potentially 2 customer bases: devstudio and c/c++
Jul 27 13:09:00 <mbenitez>	mbooth, I don't know, I'd think no, maybe worth us talking to nboldt about how they are delivering things
Jul 27 13:09:15 <mbenitez>	maybe we should schedule a call for that
Jul 27 13:09:55 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: I think we should go with the freedom to have yum repo separately for now
Jul 27 13:10:15 <akurtakov>	not puting it in any channel and etc.
Jul 27 13:10:22 <mbenitez>	ok
Jul 27 13:10:31 <akurtakov>	just generate the devstudio rpms and run createrepo
Jul 27 13:11:29 <akurtakov>	if/when someone clears the shipping not-build from source in channels
Jul 27 13:11:40 <akurtakov>	we can think of having channel for it
Jul 27 13:12:16 <akurtakov>	but for the initial release that would be an overkill as I would bet this question will not be cleared :)
Jul 27 13:23:25 <mbooth>	mbenitez: BTW, erratum is created: https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/24366
Jul 27 13:23:47 <mbooth>	Had to also make the bug "modified"
Jul 27 13:24:35 <mbooth>	Should be called "BureaucracyZilla"
Jul 27 13:25:47 <nboldt>	mbenitez: we deliver things via a release-engineering@redhat.com / RCM ticket. siege then copies the zips & jars from internal server to CSP stging server and download manager, gets approval from QE, and pushes things to production.
Jul 27 13:26:39 <nboldt>	I've no idea what the rules are for binary-only RPMs, but we ship binary-only installer & update sites, with either a sources zip beside it or a link back to github for fresh sources
Jul 27 13:32:13 <mbooth>	nboldt: A yum repo is not that different to a p2 repo -- your rpms could probably be the same way.
Jul 27 13:32:30 <mbooth>	s/probably be/probably be delivered/
Jul 27 13:32:55 <nboldt>	so we're currently thinking of rh-eclipse46-base, rh-eclipse46-c++, and rh-eclipse46-devstudio as the three rpms?
Jul 27 13:33:17 <nboldt>	mbooth: ^ ?
Jul 27 13:33:49 <nboldt>	or maybe the second one is called rh-eclipse46-linuxtools-and-profiling-and-cdt-and-so-on....
Jul 27 13:34:34 <mbooth>	nboldt: Or maybe "rh-eclipse46-dts" instead of "...c++" since you'd get the same tools as your used to from the old DTS product
Jul 27 13:35:00 <nboldt>	ah, ok
Jul 27 13:35:14 <nboldt>	mbooth: so we have a "base/commons/whatever" one and two named for products?
Jul 27 13:35:50 <nboldt>	rh-eclipse46-basic-common-shared-stuff, rh-eclipse46-dts, rh-eclipse46-devstudio ?
Jul 27 13:35:57 <mbooth>	Sounds reasonable
Jul 27 13:36:11 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Thoughts? ^
Jul 27 13:36:15 <nboldt>	but these are metapackages for stuff underneath, right?
Jul 27 13:36:22 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yes
Jul 27 13:36:39 <nboldt>	so rh-eclipse46-devstudio would actually install things like eclipse-webtools, eclipse-datatools, eclipse-gef, eclipse-mylyn, ...
Jul 27 13:37:00 <nboldt>	and possibly an rpm called devstudio-javaee-datatools-something-something
Jul 27 13:37:29 <akurtakov>	mbooth: what do you ask exactly?
Jul 27 13:38:00 <nboldt>	akurtakov: names of the three RHSCL metpackages: rh-eclipse46-basic-common-shared-stuff, rh-eclipse46-dts, rh-eclipse46-devstudio ?
Jul 27 13:38:10 <nboldt>	metapackages*
Jul 27 13:39:07 <akurtakov>	the third one rh-eclipse46-devstudio can be named just rhdevstudio as it woud not come from this metapackage as content for it will not be in that channel
Jul 27 13:40:00 <akurtakov>	so rh-eclipse46-dts will be additional Provides to rh-eclipse46 (as this one must install the whole scl as per convention)
Jul 27 13:40:52 <akurtakov>	actually eclipse is separate scl now
Jul 27 13:40:59 <nboldt>	akurtakov: so you'd call the three packages rh-eclipse46, rh-eclipse46-dts, and rhdevstudio ?
Jul 27 13:41:12 <akurtakov>	so we should not mention scl 
Jul 27 13:41:15 <akurtakov>	er dts
Jul 27 13:41:26 <nboldt>	because product no longer exists?
Jul 27 13:41:37 <nboldt>	*will no longer* exist?
Jul 27 13:41:42 <akurtakov>	no, because eclipse is split from it
Jul 27 13:41:58 <akurtakov>	and dts becomes toolchain (gcc, gdb...) only
Jul 27 13:43:01 <akurtakov>	so rh-eclipse46 is the current dts eclipse (Provides can be added for yum install "coolname" to work
Jul 27 13:43:31 <nboldt>	ok, can we at least decide what the devstudio "C" package will be called?
Jul 27 13:43:42 <akurtakov>	the only thing in question is what to append after rh-eclipse46- for the shared one
Jul 27 13:43:45 <nboldt>	devstudio-javaee (because it's mostly for javaee work) ?
Jul 27 13:43:54 <akurtakov>	I like rhdevstudio
Jul 27 13:44:01 <nboldt>	or rh-eclipse46-devstudio ?
Jul 27 13:44:11 <nboldt>	rhdevstudio is probably forbidden by Brand
Jul 27 13:44:19 <akurtakov>	meh :)
Jul 27 13:44:54 <nboldt>	having been on the receiving end of Brand/UX screwing me over not once but twice in the last GA release, I can assure you that we need to do things according to the Book Of Brand
Jul 27 13:45:11 <akurtakov>	so let it be rh-eclipse46-devstudio :)
Jul 27 13:45:13 <nboldt>	failure to adhere to their rules will result in 11th hour panic & extra work
Jul 27 13:45:16 <nboldt>	ok
Jul 27 13:45:46 <nboldt>	so in this context "devstudio" is all the stuff that makes the current devstudio be devstudio, EXCEPT its upstream eclipse-* dependencies
Jul 27 13:45:53 <akurtakov>	I would rather see UX people starting eclipse and working on simplifying real UX 
Jul 27 13:46:04 <akurtakov>	nboldt: yes
Jul 27 13:46:05 <nboldt>	thus jbosstools, com.jboss.devstudio.* features, and some eclipse stuff that's not avaialble in rpms
Jul 27 13:47:00 <akurtakov>	UX should deal with real UX like https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/ not with package names
Jul 27 13:49:28 <akurtakov>	e.g. smth like https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Boxes for the docker plugins 
Jul 27 13:49:52 <akurtakov>	but I can only dream on focusing on real, user facing stuff
Jul 27 13:51:52 <nboldt>	mbenitez: if it would help, I can add people to the eclipse-list@ list for you. but you'll have to make me an admin and fwd me a list of email addresses
Jul 27 13:56:59 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thanks for the offer!
Jul 27 13:57:07 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_: have I captured all the testing cases you want here? https://trello.com/c/nW3ajKJa/7-wrap-new-devstudio-javaee-update-site-inside-an-rpm-for-linux-installs
Jul 27 13:57:28 <nboldt>	if you want to split that into another card so you can track QE stuff separately, feel free
Jul 27 13:58:05 <nboldt>	(much of the discussion at the G2 sprint plan was "is a card done if the doc's not done? what if the work's done, the doc's done, but the doc's not QE'd?"
Jul 27 13:58:24 <nboldt>	... to which I would say "you need a second card for the doc team's work")
Jul 27 13:58:33 <mbenitez>	mbooth, I like the new name "BureaucracyZilla" :D thanks for creating the errata
Jul 27 13:58:59 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, looking
Jul 27 14:28:12 <akazakov>	nboldt, why do you call it devstudio-javaee ?
Jul 27 14:28:26 <akazakov>	it's not only javee stuff, right?
Jul 27 14:29:13 <nboldt>	got a better name, akazakov ?
Jul 27 14:29:21 <nboldt>	devstudio-devstudio seems daft
Jul 27 14:29:31 <nboldt>	and devstudio-common isn't true
Jul 27 14:29:45 <akazakov>	javaee is not true either..
Jul 27 14:29:53 <nboldt>	we already use "devstudio core" to differentiate from integration stack, so it's a subset of core
Jul 27 14:30:01 <nboldt>	devstudio-subcore?
Jul 27 14:30:42 <akazakov>	this name is for update site only, correct?
Jul 27 14:31:10 <nboldt>	yes
Jul 27 14:31:26 <nboldt>	to differentiate it from the core, central, earlyaccess, targetplatform-*, etc.
Jul 27 14:36:37 <akazakov>	nboldt, I don't know.. maybe devstudio-tools.. I'm bad with names...

Jul 28 11:30:58 <ericwill>	akurtakov good news: ipun and I are working on a patch with the GTK guys for the font business
Jul 28 11:31:10 <ericwill>	early testing shows that it fixes the bug

Aug 01 12:53:05 <akurtakov>	mbooth: sorry, I'm still doing proof reading :)
Aug 01 12:53:15 <mbooth>	akurtakov: What do you think it should say now it's not part of DTS?
Aug 01 12:53:23 <mbooth>	Just "Eclipse Neon" maybe?
Aug 01 12:53:39 <akurtakov>	Red Hat Eclipse?

Aug 02 11:34:38 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: jjohnstn: hello ! would you be available tomorrow for a quick weekly call ? We now have our own dashboard on JIRA for the sprint planning (https://issues.jboss.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=3636&view=planning), so we could discuss about it and see what we plan to do for the current sprint. 
Aug 02 11:43:21 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: i'm available.. not sure if jeff is back.
Aug 02 11:43:53 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: oh, I thought he was back yesterday. Or is it on Thursday ? 
Aug 02 11:44:34 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: i don't see him as being on pto..so i'm guessing should be today.
Aug 02 11:44:53 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: ^
Aug 02 11:51:28 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: tomorrow is fine...what time?
Aug 02 11:52:08 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: rgrunber: same as usual ? 9am for you / 3pm for you ?
Aug 02 11:59:12 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: jjohnstn: I just sent the invitations for tomorrow. Please let me know if this works for you
Aug 02 11:59:45 <xcoulon>	or if you want it a bit later (but not too much, I also have family constraints at 5pm CET)
Aug 02 12:31:05 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: it is fine..can you look at: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22274 and tell me why I keep getting messages saying: "This email is the result of a query to locate stalled/invalid jiras. Please fix them. Thanks!"
Aug 02 12:40:56 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: we have a daily job that queries the JIRA issues and find erroneous issues. You should have more info about what's wrong in the mail body, but at first sight, I would say that's because the issue is set to be fixed in 4.4.1.AM1 which is past and the issue is still opened. So you should probably set a new fix version.
Aug 02 12:42:35 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: thx, I changed to 4.4.1.AM2 so hopefully that is ok
Aug 02 12:42:46 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: yes, I guess it will be fine

Aug 03 06:47:16 <akurtakov>	mbooth: scela: what comes from mylyn incubation?
Aug 03 06:47:40 <scela>	akurtakov: i don't think the trick was done in incubation
Aug 03 06:47:46 <scela>	rather in the main repo
Aug 03 06:48:38 <akurtakov>	I was thinking as incubation usually creates some issues
Aug 03 06:48:49 <akurtakov>	we may decide dropping it from mylyn package
Aug 03 06:49:02 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Some Trac plugin and some "Web Tasks" plugin
Aug 03 06:49:07 <akurtakov>	and what comes from it could be separate one if at all needed 
Aug 03 06:49:36 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Basically scela was foiled by some "creative release engineering"

Aug 03 09:13:17 *	rgrunber looks
Aug 03 09:14:15 <rgrunber>	ah indirectly referenced.. hmm seems like that would be a 'plugin' bug.. ie.. needs an import package on it.. or at least to add to that .java file.
Aug 03 09:14:43 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to mattn
Aug 03 09:17:26 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Interesting, I wonder why it did work previously
Aug 03 09:17:50 <rgrunber>	.. could it be a change in swtbot ?
Aug 03 09:18:30 <rgrunber>	i mean indirectly referenced happens for things like doing foo().bar() where bar() returns a class you don't import or whatnot..
Aug 03 09:18:39 <rgrunber>	from what i remember..
Aug 03 09:20:25 <mbooth>	I mean, why did it work before applying that patch? Nothing else should have changed
Aug 03 09:20:49 <mbooth>	Those locally installed bundles messing it up?
Aug 03 09:21:42 <rgrunber>	hmmm
Aug 03 09:22:11 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Hi, we are talking about https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1362178
Aug 03 09:22:32 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: I wonder if the problem goes away if you clear your ~/.eclipse again
Aug 03 09:23:30 <rgrunber>	the other thing is i may need to properly fix things.. ie..the fix vkadlcik has now isn't complete..
Aug 03 09:24:34 <rgrunber>	also is the org.eclipse.swt in the plugins folder identical to the one on the system... i would try to confirm.. if he used a very new swtbot it might have fetched a newer swt...
Aug 03 09:30:11 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, hi Roland, if you're joining the call now I'm in Yonge if you want to join
Aug 03 09:30:37 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: sure, i'll head over there.. just finishing up current docker call
Aug 03 09:31:26 <mbenitez>	sure, no worries
Aug 03 09:33:45 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: i'm very sorry but i'm in network problems now and my irc is practically unusable
Aug 03 09:33:49 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: the problem persists even with deleted ~/.eclipse

Aug 03 10:25:59 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik_gone: i can have a look.. assuming mbooth isn't on the machine testing.
Aug 03 10:26:16 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Not yet :-)

Aug 03 11:42:28 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i was just gonna ask about that :P
Aug 03 11:42:42 <mbooth>	Ask what?
Aug 03 11:42:52 <rgrunber>	mbooth: accessing the rh-eclipse stuff.
Aug 03 11:42:57 <mbooth>	Aha
Aug 03 11:43:09 <mbooth>	Then that was just for you ;-)
Aug 03 11:43:19 <rgrunber>	also if you're away and i may need to push changes from fedora eclipse into that rh-eclipse..

Aug 03 11:45:02 <rgrunber>	ah, awesome
Aug 03 11:53:12 <mbenitez>	thanks for the email mbooth 
Aug 03 11:55:00 <mbooth>	mbenitez: No worries, I expected backlash due to sending HTML email ;-)
Aug 03 11:55:20 <mbenitez>	haha
Aug 03 11:55:53 <mbooth>	Oh cripes I sent it to the wrong list -- sorry
Aug 03 11:57:56 <mbenitez>	no worries, this is new
Aug 03 11:58:34 <rgrunber>	mbooth: one question about the bug in rh-eclipse. when vkadlcik_gone outlined the steps to reproduce, those are things that worked on dts-4.. and not thing that worked on rh-eclipse prior to my patch.. right ?
Aug 03 11:59:46 <rgrunber>	ah .. umm nvm.. yeah it would imply the patch failed..
Aug 03 12:00:06 <rgrunber>	since for 3 to fail all of 1-2 had to work..
Aug 03 12:04:22 <mbooth>	Yeah, everything except installation worked on rh-eclipse prior to the patch
Aug 03 12:05:57 <rgrunber>	mbooth: what i'm seeing is that no platform bundle is detected by the target platform which seems unrelated.. i'll debug it to see.
Aug 03 12:06:07 <rgrunber>	which would explain why it isn't being found.
Aug 03 12:13:16 <mbenitez>	ldimaggi, thank you for all the updates Len!
Aug 03 12:13:45 <ldimaggi>	mbenitez, just trying to tie up the many loose ends!   ;-)

Aug 03 13:29:18 <rgrunber>	mbooth: problem in the bug seems to be solved by the patch i'll end up applying to fix the 'p2.runnable' problem.
Aug 03 13:29:50 <mbooth>	That's good, right?
Aug 03 13:30:12 <rgrunber>	yup.. so first patch caused issues likely because it wasn't completed.. and p2.runnable is needed.
Aug 03 13:30:55 <rgrunber>	in fact what occured is bundles.info never got generated in the user's $HOME/.eclipse.. so of course target platform generation failed... because it was looking for the bundles.info there.
Aug 03 13:31:08 <rgrunber>	it found the droplets just fine.. but not any of the platform files.

Aug 03 15:52:07 <ericwill>	mbooth haha, I can imagine :)
Aug 03 15:52:50 <ericwill>	as a side note, I'm really impressed by the number of old bugs that have snippet reproducers attached
Aug 03 15:52:53 <ericwill>	really makes life easier
Aug 03 15:59:23 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Would you quickly try something for me?
Aug 03 15:59:30 <rgrunber>	mbooth: sure
Aug 03 16:00:02 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I just sent you a script and a spec file...
Aug 03 16:00:45 <rgrunber>	i'm guessing you want me to build it..
Aug 03 16:01:01 <mbooth>	(Based on your original script) Running this script should result in a binary RPM that installs some droplets generated from p2 repos
Aug 03 16:01:32 <mbooth>	Yes please, also please take a look to see if its sane
Aug 03 16:02:08 <mbooth>	Actually a yum repo, not just a binary rpm
Aug 03 16:02:11 <rgrunber>	ahh.. one thing i probably also missed from the repo2runnable script, the option '-flagAsRunnable'
Aug 03 16:04:18 <rgrunber>	so basically you assume some source folder exists called %{?scl_prefix}devstudio.tar.gz or whatnot.. you extract its contents.. then you call feature/bundle publisher to create the p2 repo from it.. i mean the paths would need to match up.. between the location of those bundles and 'file:$(pwd)/p2-repo'..
Aug 03 16:05:18 <mbooth>	The build.sh generates the tarball and the srpm, so paths should always br correct
Aug 03 16:05:25 <rgrunber>	ah.. d'oh
Aug 03 16:06:27 <rgrunber>	ah.. build.sh is the thing being executed
Aug 03 16:06:42 <mbooth>	Yes, that wasn't clear, sorry
Aug 03 16:08:24 <mbooth>	Assumptions made: Machine you are running this on can run mock (Fedora, probably) and you are inside the firewall (so you can build RHEL7 chroot)
Aug 03 16:08:57 <mbooth>	My thinking is that using mock should give pretty reproducible results outside of brew
Aug 03 16:11:41 <rgrunber>	k seems to be working.. downloaded stuff.. wrote the srpm..
Aug 03 16:12:10 <rgrunber>	doing the mock build now...
Aug 03 16:15:06 <rgrunber>	mbooth: there's one improvement that could be made from that 'p2_feature_curl' thing i wrote.. and that's to actually call the director to install the units. it would require the user list all repositories (like http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon) but we could do some logic afterwards like.. is this bundle from the p2 repo we care about or one of the others.. and decide whether to add it to the 
Aug 03 16:15:12 <rgrunber>	droplet on that criteria.
Aug 03 16:15:39 <rgrunber>	^ that would give us things like docker-client, jersey, ... in the case of linuxtools.docker.. instead of forcing there to be some feature that lists everything.
Aug 03 16:19:24 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yeah i guess for reproducibility you'd need to run it inside mock.. is it worth supplying an option in the future for the user to point to their own eclipse install.. i mean it'd be much faster should they choose that..
Aug 03 16:20:11 <mbooth>	Well, second run is faster since the mock root is cached
Aug 03 16:21:47 <mbooth>	And it's kind of just going be hooked into their existing deploy process -- I don't see people wanting to invoke this manually that much
Aug 03 16:23:21 <mbooth>	I see what you mean about improving 'p2_feature_curl' though
Aug 03 16:25:50 <rgrunber>	yeah we need p2's dep resolution greatness.. but then we want to remove all jars that came from somewhere else... or ... i think if we somehow use the system eclipse's profile.. it should.. not bring in the whole platform..
Aug 03 16:25:56 <rgrunber>	something to test though...
Aug 03 16:29:38 <rgrunber>	yay building the rpm..
Aug 03 16:31:30 <rgrunber>	mbooth: works for me.. built the yum repo contents seem right.
Aug 03 16:32:53 <mbooth>	Good :-)
Aug 03 16:34:07 <mbooth>	Building a second time should be super quick (the whole of maven is in the build root, a bit unnecessarily for this)
Aug 03 16:34:16 <rgrunber>	ah you even got rid of the feature.jars
Aug 03 16:34:43 <rgrunber>	ah nvm.. expanded on it to do features..
Aug 03 16:37:20 <rgrunber>	yeah this is awesome, nicely done.

Aug 04 07:08:38 <scela>	vkadlcik: np
Aug 04 07:25:27 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: No, that is not intentional :-( I guess file lists need refreshing in errata or something otherwise the SCL might not be installable from the compose :-(

Aug 05 10:24:18 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: ping.. ?
Aug 05 10:24:32 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: pong
Aug 05 10:24:50 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: is there access to the machine on which the slowness is happening ?
Aug 05 10:28:21 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: i'll prepare it, give me 15 min
Aug 05 10:28:50 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: i'm trying it out on 10.16.186.62 but wasn't able to reproduce huge delay yet..
Aug 05 10:34:21 <rgrunber>	ok nvm.. i've reproduced something that takes long. might be a similar cause.
Aug 05 10:41:39 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: so just in case: vncviewer ibm-ls22-04.rhts.eng.brq.redhat.com:1, password is redhat
Aug 05 10:41:58 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: it's starting -application org.eclipse.swtbot.eclipse.junit.headless.swtbottestapplication
Aug 05 10:42:34 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: now in about 3 min from my command
Aug 05 10:42:47 <rgrunber>	yup i see..
Aug 05 10:43:05 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: i won't be using the machine today
Aug 05 10:43:27 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: all the passwords should be redhat
Aug 05 10:47:01 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: can you try instead of calling 'eclipse' for the time being, to replace it with 'java -jar /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/lib*/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launch_*.jar .. that seemed to make a huge difference when i was trying it out..
Aug 05 10:47:35 <rgrunber>	also it seems only the first run is insanely slow, definitely droplets related though.
Aug 05 10:50:04 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: i used to do it that way but one it needs more parameters and they seem to differ between versions so i ended up with simple 'eclipse'
Aug 05 10:50:26 <vkadlcik>	s/ one//
Aug 05 10:52:20 <rgrunber>	vkadlcik: yeah can be a bit trick to always try to find the equinox launcher.. just a workaround until i figure a solution for the issue.
Aug 05 10:56:56 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: finding the launcher isn't tricky, the problem was to add all the additional switches in a way that would work across all supported eclipse versions
Aug 05 10:57:17 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: but i can do it, in the worst case :-)
Aug 05 10:57:22 <rgrunber>	ah wait for tests there's additional paramaters other than just what you specified.. ?
Aug 05 11:01:34 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: hmm, nope, please stick with what's in bugzilla; what i do normally is out of scope
Aug 05 11:01:45 <vkadlcik>	rgrunber: sorry for the confusion

Aug 08 05:43:37 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Hi, sure -- let me take a look now
Aug 08 05:44:44 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to palves
Aug 08 05:59:37 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Okay done, hopefully that should be better
Aug 08 06:09:16 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: thanks, just checked - still rh-eclipse46-build is missing
Aug 08 06:09:29 <mbooth>	D'oh
Aug 08 06:19:29 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: I don't know how to fix this one -- even removing and re-adding the build did not work :-(
Aug 08 06:19:35 <mbooth>	Let me ask rzima
Aug 08 06:20:54 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: ack

Aug 08 09:49:26 <mbooth>	Morning, mbenitez 
Aug 08 09:49:44 <mbenitez>	mbooth, hello Mat, how was your long weekend?
Aug 08 09:50:01 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Nice and sunny, thanks :-)
Aug 08 09:50:12 <mbenitez>	excellent :)
Aug 08 09:51:02 <mbooth>	mbenitez: You should know that there was a slight problem reported with the alpha hand-off that needs PM clarification: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1365100
Aug 08 09:51:24 *	mbenitez looks
Aug 08 09:53:28 <mbenitez>	mbooth, interesting, I didn't know rhscl doesn't provide this build feature
Aug 08 09:54:27 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Me neither, this caught us by surprise
Aug 08 09:54:48 <mbenitez>	mbooth, I just asked briang in #devtoolset, thanks fro bringing this up
Aug 08 10:36:47 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: woohoo ! it took me a bit of time, but I've just managed to parse the Docker Compose output, read the ANSI escape codes and print in the MessageConsole with proper text coloring: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4v1y94fpgzayxx0/Screenshot%202016-08-08%2016.29.25.png?dl=0
Aug 08 10:37:19 <xcoulon>	there's still work to do, though
Aug 08 10:40:21 <rgrunber>	looks good to me. we can probably use that same work to support container logs that have escape codes.. without moving them to tm terminal.
Aug 08 10:45:09 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, that was my thought too. I suggest we discuss about it in an upcoming change, ok ?
Aug 08 10:46:39 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to mbenitez
Aug 08 10:46:55 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: sure. btw is this something you've written from scratch ? or based on existing stuff from projects that have done the same.
Aug 08 10:47:18 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: nope, I wrote it from scratch
Aug 08 10:47:47 <rgrunber>	i might look at other projects that have done it to ensure we support all possible codes.
Aug 08 10:49:24 <rgrunber>	i mean specifically for things like colours, or really uncommon codes.
Aug 08 11:55:01 <rgrunber>	mbooth: thanks for offering hope in that automated testing bug. i'm interested to discover what's causing reconciler to take 10min to decide to do (i hope) nothing but if disabling it is an option we can probably discuss.

Aug 08 12:01:31 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Good question :-)
Aug 08 12:09:09 <mbenitez>	you can consider this release a major so no commitments to backwards functionality if that helps
Aug 08 12:12:53 <rgrunber>	yeah, i guess we can just disable it in the worst case. Figuring out the real issue becomes a bit of a bonus, assuming ptp migration to droplets goes smoothly.

Aug 09 11:05:16 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: I don't think you will have missed anything vital, there was mostly just talk about BZ/Jira integration :-)
Aug 09 11:05:33 <rgrunber>	mbooth: so about the p2_feature_curl part, i'm guessing that currently doesn't pick up transitive dependencies.. ie only stuff that's a direct dep of the feature ?
Aug 09 11:05:54 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: thanks
Aug 09 11:07:49 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Yes -- but I did add an option to download a "whole" update site (i.e. if you don't specify a feature it lists all IUs with a jar payload and downloads everything)
Aug 09 11:08:18 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yup, i think i saw it in the updated version.
Aug 09 11:08:31 <nboldt>	mbenitez: mbooth: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22966
Aug 09 11:08:53 <nboldt>	If I missed anything important or screwed anything up, please edit the JIRA or throw comments on it
Aug 09 11:10:12 <rgrunber>	i mentioned it before a bit but was thinking of changing that to call the p2 director to install the feature.group iu (with empty profile specified). this way script only needs to specify the main p2 repo, and the locatin of other repos for which platform/additional content exists. from there we just remove the additional content and are left with just the jars needed from the main repo.
Aug 09 11:10:43 <rgrunber>	added benefit would be that it should support composites since director takes care of it.
Aug 09 11:11:09 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thank you! I had it in my TODO to file the issue as you requested :)
Aug 09 11:11:33 <nboldt>	rgrunber: I'm going to be doing something very similar for the rh-eclipse46-devstudio rpm creation
Aug 09 11:11:41 <nboldt>	rgrunber: we should combine forces :D
Aug 09 11:12:13 <nboldt>	mbenitez: 
Aug 09 11:12:50 <nboldt>	mbenitez: one question ... not sure I'll be able to get this written this week as well as getting the RPM stuff prototyped. I'm going to assume bzira scrape is less important than rpm creation
Aug 09 11:13:12 <mbenitez>	vkadlcik_gone, thank you for joining!
Aug 09 11:14:46 <rgrunber>	nboldt: yeah, so the problem i want to address is that generally features don't include *everything* they need, so for linuxtools.docker you probably won't get jersey*,jnr*,jackson* even though they should be in the droplet.
Aug 09 11:15:37 <nboldt>	ah, then the feature owner should revamp the feature (or better, its plugins) to proeprly declare dependencies and versions
Aug 09 11:15:49 <nboldt>	don't fix this in your tool. make the projects upstream behave correctly :D
Aug 09 11:15:59 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ^
Aug 09 11:16:42 <rgrunber>	nboldt: well, not really, because that's how features work. a feature just says "these are things i'm providing that i own".. it would kinda be abusing osgi if you decided to include everything needed.
Aug 09 11:17:17 <mbooth>	Eclipse features are an abuse of OSGi anyway :-p
Aug 09 11:17:38 <rgrunber>	i mean if you ran the director it works fine.. problem is when you query a feature for its dependencies, you'll only get the immediate plugins.. not all deps recursively.
Aug 09 11:17:43 <nboldt>	rgrunber: MANIFEEST.MF in plugins are SUPPOSED to define their deps
Aug 09 11:18:16 <nboldt>	feature is a more loose definition of requirements but you can certainly set includes AND deps in feature.xml
Aug 09 11:18:39 <nboldt>	best practices says to do the dep declaration in the plugins, but if there's a good reason to move that into the feature, it can be done there too
Aug 09 11:18:43 <nboldt>	(or instead)
Aug 09 11:19:11 <mbooth>	I think you are agreeing with one another...
Aug 09 11:19:13 <nboldt>	tldr, the problem is in the upstream plugins' MANIFEST.MF files. Fix those and your tools will work correctly
Aug 09 11:19:37 <rgrunber>	yeah.. so that's what i'm getting at.. if we just call the director, we'll get what we need.
Aug 09 11:21:00 <rgrunber>	what we're doing now is getting just the feature.group requirements.. and stopping there.. or downloading the entire repo, which i guess would assume the repo is a 1-1 mapping with the droplet content.. which again might not be true upstream.
Aug 09 11:23:17 <nboldt>	exactly. director (or p2.mirror) is better than whatever else you're using as it doesn't read p2 metadata
Aug 09 11:23:25 <nboldt>	it = whatever else
Aug 09 11:23:56 <nboldt>	director will install things (unpack jars); p2.mirror will simply copy them as is
Aug 09 11:23:59 <rgrunber>	nboldt: well the feature getting thing works in some special cases (feature defines everything needed, entire p2 repo is the droplet)
Aug 09 11:27:06 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i mean i don't mind working on this if i can get some time.. i had something written up, but unless you're already working on it..
Aug 09 11:29:14 <nboldt>	I need to (re)create a script that can, for a list of features, produce an update site
Aug 09 11:29:33 <nboldt>	I think that might be a different usecase than you if you're using director to unpack the features
Aug 09 11:31:04 <rgrunber>	nboldt: so given an update site and list of features, it produces a more compact update site ?..
Aug 09 11:31:15 <rgrunber>	excluding non-essential stuff.
Aug 09 11:31:32 <nboldt>	yes
Aug 09 11:31:43 <nboldt>	that's what I need for the rh-eclipse46-devstudio RPM
Aug 09 11:31:50 <nboldt>	based on mbooth's build.sh script
Aug 09 11:31:59 <rgrunber>	nboldt: it's quite similar. we want to do the same, except our final output is a droplet, not another update site.
Aug 09 11:32:08 <rgrunber>	oh.. :P hah
Aug 09 11:32:23 <nboldt>	is a droplet "given an update site, install everything in it" ?
Aug 09 11:33:16 <rgrunber>	nboldt: droplet is just an update site that has had the repo2runnable task run on it with -createFragments.
Aug 09 11:34:06 <nboldt>	ah... so yes. same use case then
Aug 09 11:34:19 <nboldt>	I believe the rh-eclipse46-devstudio RPM is thus "a droplet" too :D
Aug 09 11:34:24 *	nboldt is learning the terms here
Aug 09 11:35:52 <rgrunber>	nboldt: basically i'm saying, if we modify the p2_feature_curl method in build.sh to call the director to install.. and do a bit of pruning of unnecessary things, then you no longer need to do what you were going to do.. or at least do less..
Aug 09 11:36:44 <nboldt>	rgrunber: oh... that's cool
Aug 09 11:37:04 <nboldt>	that would possibly save time / effort and be reusable for your stuff too
Aug 09 11:37:29 <nboldt>	I'll be in the office this afternoon so we can talk more in person (if you're in today)
Aug 09 11:37:44 <rgrunber>	nboldt: the only thing that i'd need to know, is would there be some kind of update site that contains things like "org.eclipse.ui, org.eclipse.platform, ... base platform stuff"
Aug 09 11:38:01 <nboldt>	yes! we have that 
Aug 09 11:38:03 <rgrunber>	ie. that is used in devtools product ..
Aug 09 11:38:11 <rgrunber>	worst case i use releases/neon or whatnot
Aug 09 11:38:43 <nboldt>	point director at https://devstudio.jboss.com/10.0/stable/updates/ and if it can scrape children of the composite all the deps you need should be there
Aug 09 11:39:00 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to jjohnstn
Aug 09 11:39:03 <nboldt>	since that site contains devstudio + devstudio target platform
Aug 09 11:39:32 <nboldt>	rgrunber: we also have the same site as 4 zips, if you want to play offline and save b/w download time for iterative experiments
Aug 09 11:40:01 <nboldt>	zips are linked on https://devstudio.jboss.com/10.0/stable/updates/ in the right hand column under "Offline Install"
Aug 09 11:40:04 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ^
Aug 09 11:43:23 <rgrunber>	yeah i'll have to play around with things.. a lot of this work will vary depending on what assumptions/input data is being given.
Aug 09 11:44:07 <nboldt>	yep
Aug 09 11:46:02 <rgrunber>	nboldt: oh final thing :P , is there any plan to map issue states (NEW,ASSIGNED,..,VERIFIED,CLOSED) into jira ?
Aug 09 11:46:51 <rgrunber>	can be slight pain to remember to change a bug twice (once in bz, once in jira)
Aug 09 11:46:52 <nboldt>	currently no, the tool only creates the JIRA
Aug 09 11:47:11 <nboldt>	but in future yes, we could have VERIFIED => resolved, CLOSED -> closed
Aug 09 11:47:24 <nboldt>	add that to the JIRA I opened (or make a subtask?)
Aug 09 11:47:38 <nboldt>	rgrunber: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22966 
Aug 09 11:48:01 <rgrunber>	yeah, sounds good, i'll do that

Aug 09 16:28:01 <nboldt>	rgrunber: any progress on scripting a replacement to go in build.sh ?
Aug 09 16:29:43 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i've got something already on my home laptop (which isn't here with me) but i'm sure it'll work.
Aug 09 16:30:16 <rgrunber>	was working on it around the time i handed off the script to Mat but got sidetracked.
Aug 09 16:34:17 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ok, no worries. I'll work on something else and bug you again in a day or two :D
Aug 09 16:34:26 <nboldt>	no point reinventing your wheel 
Aug 09 16:34:45 <nboldt>	(but happy to review your code & test it out for my rpm)
Aug 09 16:35:24 <rgrunber>	nboldt: yeah np.. i should finish it quickly.. i thought i hit a rather annoying block with respect to associative arrays in bash.. but apparently they need to be explicitly enabled.
Aug 09 16:36:49 <nboldt>	haven't used assoc arrays in bash in a while but I don't recall that... just that you had to type-declare the object before loading it.
Aug 09 16:37:10 <rgrunber>	yeah.. that's what i meant.
Aug 09 16:38:18 <nboldt>	cool
Aug 09 16:38:50 <rgrunber>	as opposed to just foo["a.b.c"]=1
Aug 09 16:39:21 <rawblem>	rgrunber,  hey, where was that api for updating the details of a docker connection again?
Aug 09 16:39:25 <rawblem>	i seem to have misplaced it
Aug 09 16:39:48 *	nboldt sees rawblem and points at the Google in the corner, just waiting to be used
Aug 09 16:40:11 <rawblem>	nboldt,  if you seriously think i can find an api via google search and simply guessing class or method names, you're insane
Aug 09 16:40:23 <rgrunber>	rawblem: DockerConnectionManager.updateConnection or something..
Aug 09 16:40:28 <rawblem>	thnx

Aug 10 10:32:39 <rgrunber>	any plans to push that build.sh + devstudio.spec into some git repo.. ?
Aug 10 10:38:12 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I figured we'd let nboldt1 add it to some git repo since it will form a part of devstudio process, not SCL process

Aug 10 10:50:24 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: yes, I was going to put it in https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product
Aug 10 10:50:36 <nboldt1>	mbooth: ^
Aug 10 10:51:16 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: feel free to push. only slight concern is that it not be mandatory.. ie.. the code can handle it being null, or empty..
Aug 10 10:51:43 <rgrunber>	because i create IDockerConnectionSettings in some places associated with the extension point providers
Aug 10 10:52:58 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: if you create TCPConnectionSettings or UnixSocketConnectionSettings under the covers, that is already handled...empty properties are ok
Aug 10 10:53:07 <rgrunber>	k sounds good then.
Aug 10 10:53:11 <jjohnstn>	thx
Aug 10 10:55:11 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: so "p2extract ${dropletP2Repo} ${neededRepo1},${neededRepo2} ${groupFeatureID} ." replaces p2_feature_curl in build.sh?

Aug 10 12:13:24 <nboldt1>	rgrunber_mtg: cool, thanks. I've reworked your script a bit to perform the install for 212 features in one step instead of having to loop through 212 installs :D
Aug 10 12:14:02 <nboldt1>	and switched to using metadataRepository and artifactRepository because need that when using p2.director -list
Aug 10 12:23:24 <nboldt1>	rgrunber_mtg: the droplet-bundles folder is missing all the unpacked plugins. is that intentional?
Aug 10 12:24:19 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to ebaron
Aug 10 12:24:29 <nboldt1>	when I mirror all the features in devstudio, I get 643M of stuff, but then the part of p2extract that copies them to droplet_bundles folder only copies 373M of stuff
Aug 10 12:24:33 <nboldt1>	rgrunber_mtg: ^
Aug 10 12:38:16 <nboldt1>	rgrunber_mtg: also playing with -profileProperties org.eclipse.update.install.features=true so that features are included in the installation :D
Aug 10 12:59:28 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: unintentional.. needs improvement.. only worked for jars for now.
Aug 10 12:59:38 <nboldt1>	ok cool
Aug 10 12:59:55 <nboldt1>	working on bootstrapping this using update site jars for better performance of CI iterations
Aug 10 14:08:31 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: any new docker tooling to include in devstudio for tomorrow's code freeze?
Aug 10 14:08:34 <nboldt1>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22885 
Aug 10 14:09:17 <nboldt1>	I see org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.feature_2.1.0.201608052203.jar as latest in http://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools/updates-docker-nightly/features/?d ... should we include that or wait until close to Aug 30 to update?
Aug 10 14:09:22 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: ^
Aug 10 14:10:38 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: there are a bunch of bug fixes.. and some new features.. i wouldn't mind getting a nightly out.. assuming we can still ship whatever we have on august 30th also..
Aug 10 14:11:03 <nboldt1>	yeah, if you bump to a nightly now, you're comitting to releasing something stable by Aug 30
Aug 10 14:13:35 <jjohnstn>	nboldt1 I am building master right now to fix a problem with Oxygen M1...this will contain some additional fixes I have resolved as part of the latest sprint
Aug 10 14:15:34 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: so... ETA for new nightly I can include for eclipse 4.6.0-based builds of devstudio 10.1 / jbosstools 4.4.1?
Aug 10 14:15:40 <nboldt1>	today? tomorrow?
Aug 10 14:15:50 <jjohnstn>	nboldt1: today
Aug 10 14:15:59 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: before or after 5pm?
Aug 10 14:16:34 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: should be before 5 pm as I have already started the build
Aug 10 14:16:54 <jjohnstn>	nboldt1: ^
Aug 10 14:18:34 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: sweet, thanks
Aug 10 14:47:25 <jjohnstn>	nboldt1 I have finished the build which I copied to update-oxygen-docker-m1...you can use nightly if you wish

Aug 11 10:09:10 <mbooth>	nboldt: Thanks for Jira formatting hints :-) BTW, is there no "quote" or "reply" button? I can't find one
Aug 11 10:17:21 <nboldt>	there's just "comment"
Aug 11 10:17:24 <nboldt>	mbooth: ^
Aug 11 10:18:07 <nboldt>	mbooth: sorta like bugzilla in that respect. but NOT like bugzilla, you can do all kinds of formatting and even emojis
Aug 11 10:18:41 <nboldt>	you will learn to love {quote} and {code} and !image.png! and [^somefile.txt] 
Aug 11 10:18:56 <mbooth>	nboldt: I guess I just miss replying to comments in-line like I would with email/bugzilla 
Aug 11 10:19:13 <mbooth>	Copy/pasting someone's reply loses formatting :-(
Aug 11 10:19:17 <nboldt>	yeah, you can do that with RCM tickets, which are backed by jira/confluence
Aug 11 10:19:38 <nboldt>	mbooth: you can EDIT someone's comment to get it as code, then paste that
Aug 11 10:20:16 <mbooth>	I can edit other folks' comments? That sounds... dangerous :-o
Aug 11 10:21:32 <nboldt>	well, I can. maybe that's only an admin ability
Aug 11 10:21:55 <nboldt>	which reminds me I need to find someone with JIRA God Mode Powers to add a new project, RHECLIPSE

Aug 11 12:10:26 <nboldt>	dumb question... http://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/overview/ says "ON WINDOWS 8:" but surely the OpenJDK .msi installer works on Win 7/8/8.1/10 ?
Aug 11 12:11:13 <nboldt>	followup dumb question, where do I report a bug in that doc? JIRA -> DEVELOPER issue? 
Aug 11 12:11:25 <nboldt>	mbenitez: patrickm: ^
Aug 11 12:12:27 <mbenitez>	nboldt, the first question would be for dbhole / omajid they are in #toronto [in a team mtg in Westford now]
Aug 11 12:12:45 <mbenitez>	the second I don't know but let me find, it's something we'll just need more and more
Aug 11 12:14:52 <nboldt>	mbenitez: https://issues.jboss.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=3362&projectKey=DEVELOPER is where I generally open issues for developers.redhat.com updates (eg., to release new devstudio)
Aug 11 12:15:09 <nboldt>	but thought maybe you guys would have a different process for openjdk (eg.., bugzilla?)
Aug 11 12:15:46 <mbenitez>	nboldt, I think that should be it then, tbh we haven't filed anything yet
Aug 11 12:21:52 <nboldt>	mbenitez: I've opened https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DEVELOPER-3393 to track the problem
Aug 11 12:22:33 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thanks Nick! for that and teaching me where to report this stuff :)
Aug 11 12:24:15 <nboldt>	mbenitez: no problem. next, I need to introduce you to Paul Robinson, who can usually escalate things in DEVELOPER when they get stuck
Aug 11 12:24:40 <nboldt>	(He's @Paul in hipchat.)
Aug 11 12:25:34 <mbenitez>	nboldt, that would be nice, I need to open a request to post an Eclipse Infocentre, finally I'll have connections on this website
Aug 11 12:26:59 <nboldt>	oh god, really? You want an infocentre on developers.redhat.com? 
Aug 11 12:27:14 <nboldt>	(I assume you mean something like http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp ?
Aug 11 12:28:06 <nboldt>	mbenitez: or do you mean simply linking to docs on eclipse.org like the SystemTap UG? http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.doc%2FLinux_Tools_Project%2FSystemtap%2FUser_Guide%2FUser-Guide.html
Aug 11 12:28:53 <mbenitez>	nboldt, yes, like that: http://infocenter-mbooth.rhcloud.com/index.jsp
Aug 11 12:29:26 <mbenitez>	nboldt, mbooth put this together long time ago and we just couldn't get follow up on where to host it, the developer portal should be the right place
Aug 11 12:30:03 <mbenitez>	at the time we were talking to rkratky he didn't know who to contact yet, but finally all the pieces are coming together
Aug 11 12:30:05 <nboldt>	I bet you'll need to rebrand that before you can put it there
Aug 11 12:30:33 <nboldt>	yeah, rob should talk to @paul about how to host it (or if we can host it)
Aug 11 12:30:41 <mbenitez>	absolutely, the design was just temporary, to show other how this could be branded for the product
Aug 11 12:30:51 <nboldt>	could dump the whole thing into github I guess :D
Aug 11 12:31:26 <mbenitez>	nboldt, glad to have you around, you have a lot of insights into the processes :)
Aug 11 12:31:27 <nboldt>	mbenitez: that would be here: https://github.com/redhat-developer/developers.redhat.com
Aug 11 12:32:11 <nboldt>	probably more like here: https://github.com/redhat-developer/developers.redhat.com/tree/master/products/developertoolset
Aug 11 12:32:27 <mbenitez>	nice!
Aug 11 12:32:51 <mbenitez>	I'll open a trello card to start tracking this again, and of course a jira
Aug 11 12:33:21 <nboldt>	yeah. (aside: there's a great asciidoctor.js plugin for Chrome which is awesome for testing .adoc files locally before pushing them as a PR or having to use rake to build them)
Aug 11 12:34:43 <nboldt>	mbenitez: I suppose the other option would be for rkratky to look at publishing the infocentre as another "multiple html pages" format and have it here: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-developer-toolset/
Aug 11 12:35:11 <mbenitez>	it seems like a good project to include with the consolidation / UX improvements we're working towards
Aug 11 12:35:35 <nboldt>	eg., another "Paged HTML" document like https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/4/html/4.1_Release_Notes/index.html
Aug 11 12:35:49 <mbenitez>	nboldt, we talked about that but there were some concerns about the content not being internally created IIRC
Aug 11 12:35:50 <nboldt>	again, Brand might complain about that idea, but *shrug*
Aug 11 12:36:05 <mbenitez>	haha no kidding, processes... ;)
Aug 11 12:36:13 <nboldt>	internally created? where did mbooth build the infocentre?
Aug 11 12:38:39 <mbooth>	nboldt: The infocenter is *built* here, but much of the content was written upstream -- it was the origin of the content that was the concern, IIRC
Aug 11 12:39:23 <mbenitez>	I think so too
Aug 11 12:40:55 <nboldt>	mbooth: oic. another "NIH" paranoia event
Aug 11 12:40:58 <mbooth>	But it seems silly that even appropriately licensed documentation cannot be rehosted...
Aug 11 12:41:02 <mbooth>	Exactly
Aug 11 12:41:16 <nboldt>	mbooth: yeah, "silly" is one word for it
Aug 11 12:41:33 <nboldt>	are they worried that the doc source isn't open enough, being html?
Aug 11 12:41:57 *	nboldt points the lawyers at the CTRL and Y keys and tell them to view-source:
Aug 11 12:42:13 <nboldt>	(ctrl-U I mean)
Aug 11 12:42:33 <mbooth>	nboldt: TBH, I don't remember. But it's nothing that isn't already shipped inside an RPM...
Aug 11 12:43:16 <nboldt>	mbooth: ah, so if it's good enough to be IN RHEL it should be good enough to be online discussing what's IN RHEL
Aug 11 12:43:49 <mbenitez>	I don't think we got to legal last time, things just got lost in conversations and we never made it close to publish
Aug 11 12:49:06 <mbenitez>	nboldt, I opened https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DEVELOPER-3394 does it look good to you?
Aug 11 12:49:20 *	mbenitez has lost the JIRA-fu over time
Aug 11 12:49:45 <mbenitez>	also added the description to trello
Aug 11 12:49:58 <nboldt>	mbenitez: you should cross link them
Aug 11 12:50:19 <mbenitez>	add the trello card to JIRA?
Aug 11 12:50:22 <nboldt>	eg., JIRA -> More > Link > Web Link > url for the trello card
Aug 11 12:50:31 <mbenitez>	ok, will do
Aug 11 12:50:58 <nboldt>	Trello > card > add Checklist > add checklist item = https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DEVELOPER-3394
Aug 11 12:51:21 <nboldt>	that way the info is in both places and PgM can track from their side / devs can track from their side, etc.
Aug 11 12:51:29 <nboldt>	it's more time/effort but imho it helps :D
Aug 11 12:53:15 <mbenitez>	good idea, it doesn't hurt :)
Aug 11 12:57:53 <nboldt>	DEVELOPER-3394 is assigned to James Cobb (our branding guy)
Aug 11 13:17:30 <patrickm>	nboldt: where in the doc does it say Windows 8?
Aug 11 13:17:48 <patrickm>	ah, in *BOLD*
Aug 11 13:18:45 <patrickm>	arrrgh, they still didn't change the Red Hat OpenJDK title
Aug 11 13:40:25 *	fuhbot2 gives channel operator status to patrickm
Aug 11 14:24:26 <nboldt>	patrickm: yep. BOLD ALL CAPS, even :D
Aug 11 14:24:48 <patrickm>	nboldt: apparently I'm an idiot ;)
Aug 11 14:25:00 <nboldt>	patrickm: I've opened https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DEVELOPER-3393 to track the problem ... feel free to add more complaints / screenshots with big red arrows, etc.
Aug 11 14:25:14 <nboldt>	patrickm: no worries. we're all blind from time to time
Aug 11 14:27:38 <patrickm>	nboldt: i was looking for it in the text... that's my excuse and I'm sticking with that story
Aug 11 14:30:52 <nboldt>	patrickm: lol, no problem
Aug 11 14:31:10 <nboldt>	I opened the JIRA before noticing that there's RHEL 6 in there too (no mention of RHEL 7)

Aug 12 09:53:43 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok. I'm working on my patch as well. Some tests are broken so I need to fix them before submitting to gerrit again
Aug 12 10:59:34 <patrickm>	nboldt: i talked with dbhole, there is not restriction in the .msi that states it should only install on Windows 8
Aug 12 10:59:43 <patrickm>	nboldt: we'll get that corrected
Aug 12 11:00:25 <patrickm>	nboldt: it seems to be an oversight, there were so many "8"'s on that page
Aug 12 11:04:14 <nboldt>	patrickm: yeah, felt like an overzealous regex matching
Aug 12 11:04:25 <nboldt>	patrickm: but that doesn't explain the RHEL 6 mention :D
Aug 12 11:04:56 <nboldt>	more likely this page was boilerplated from a year or two ago before Win10 and RHEL 7 were things we support
Aug 12 11:05:12 <patrickm>	nboldt: it does, because the pkg names are different

Aug 16 10:54:27 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: hello Roland. Did you see my comment on Gerrit ? Actually, it's more or less the same as the one I posted on BZ. Could you update your patch ? BTW, this bug is a blocker for JBoss Tools 4.4.1.AM3, so just let me know if you don't have time to fix it today, I'll take care of it.
Aug 16 10:54:55 <xcoulon>	Then once it's good, we should trigger a build of the Docker tooling so that Nick can pull it into the TP of JBoss Tools.
Aug 16 10:55:41 <rgrunber>	sure i can change them to return an empty list.
Aug 16 11:00:21 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: great ! thanks
Aug 16 11:00:36 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: we should have tests to cover this, btw.
Aug 16 11:19:11 <nboldt>	xcoulon: dude. is this REALLY a blocker given that...
Aug 16 11:19:16 <nboldt>	AM3 = alpha release
Aug 16 11:19:21 <nboldt>	TP freeze was last week
Aug 16 11:19:57 <nboldt>	changing TP on the same day as the release/QE signoff day (today) means the release will likely delayed until tomorrow or Thurs
Aug 16 11:20:09 <nboldt>	...?
Aug 16 11:20:21 <xcoulon>	nboldt: I'm not the one to decide if this is a blocker. But it looks pretty bad, since the Docker Explorer view is broken on Windows, which means that the whole Docker tooling fails.
Aug 16 11:20:38 <xcoulon>	nboldt: can we discuss this with Alexey and Len, then ?
Aug 16 11:20:51 <xcoulon>	akazakov: ldimaggi_mtg ^^
Aug 16 11:20:58 <nboldt>	xcoulon: sure. looks like we have a topic for today's build.next call
Aug 16 11:21:41 <xcoulon>	nboldt: sure.. when is this call ? Do I need to join ?
Aug 16 11:21:59 <nboldt>	xcoulon: in 9 minutes, and yes, that would be helpful
Aug 16 11:22:15 <xcoulon>	nboldt:  can you forward the invite, please ? 
Aug 16 11:22:21 <nboldt>	xcoulon: http://jbds-pm.etherpad.corp.redhat.com/build-next-20160816
Aug 16 11:22:40 <xcoulon>	nboldt: thanks ! I'm out for 5min, I'll be back for the call
Aug 16 11:22:52 <nboldt>	xcoulon: ok
Aug 16 11:23:06 <ldimaggi_mtg>	xcoulon, nboldt Given that https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-23011 is both a regression and literally blocks the use of the feature, I don't think that we should release AM3 until this is fixed
Aug 16 11:25:20 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_mtg: you're killing me, DiMaggio.
Aug 16 11:25:54 <ldimaggi_mtg>	nboldt, sorry - trying to pay attention to this massive meeting in Westford
Aug 16 11:51:02 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I commented on the issue. We plan to include a message in the user to ask them to pull the nightly build to update the Docker Tooling, but I'm also concerned with this issue that I found today: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=499744 and I think we should also fix that one before we ask the users to update the bundles.
Aug 16 11:51:43 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I'm going to look at it right now
Aug 16 12:01:55 <nboldt>	xcoulon: rgrunber: will the docker tools nightly site have the fix by EOD today?
Aug 16 12:02:22 <xcoulon>	nboldt: I think so, yes.
Aug 16 12:02:28 <rgrunber>	yes.
Aug 16 12:02:59 <nboldt>	ok cool
Aug 16 12:03:09 <nboldt>	then when the blog goes out (tomorrow?) it'll be accurate
Aug 16 12:03:11 <xcoulon>	nboldt: but I found a bug this morning that I'd rather see fixed before asking the users to install the nightly build. I'm already working on it now
Aug 16 12:03:37 <nboldt>	xcoulon: bug in docker tooling or in openshift?
Aug 16 12:03:42 <xcoulon>	nboldt: yes, if blog goes out tomorrow it should be fine, the update site should be up-to-date.
Aug 16 12:03:47 <xcoulon>	nboldt: bug in Docker tooling
Aug 16 12:03:48 <nboldt>	sweet
Aug 16 12:03:53 <nboldt>	ok perfect
Aug 16 12:04:09 <xcoulon>	nboldt: I appreciate your sense of "perfect" ;-)
Aug 16 12:04:44 <nboldt>	perfect, for all values of "good enough"
Aug 16 12:04:47 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: what's the issue with bug 499744 ? looks like an issue with remote api output format...
Aug 16 12:05:34 <rgrunber>	media type=text/plain ? .. for Container messages i would think that should be application/json
Aug 16 12:05:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: damn'it, I commented on the wrong issue. Please ignore the "comment 1"
Aug 16 12:06:21 <rgrunber>	in fact i remember filing a bug ages ago for some remote api returns which specify a media type of text/plain.. which was clearly wrong.
Aug 16 12:06:22 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: but also, can you try to reproduce it ? I can't see the new connection in the Explorer view
Aug 16 12:06:39 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, me too. This was at the time of Docker 1.7
Aug 16 12:07:40 <rgrunber>	so it's related to version of docker daemon used.. possibly.
Aug 16 12:08:57 <xcoulon>	I would think so, but I commented there for another bug
Aug 16 12:09:03 <xcoulon>	which is on CDK
Aug 16 12:09:44 <xcoulon>	499744 is just about the Docker Explorer view not being refreshed, I think. But first I'm writing an SWT Bot test to retproduce it
Aug 16 12:09:53 <xcoulon>	s/retproduce/reproduce
Aug 16 12:10:50 <rgrunber>	ahhh ok i c now.. your comment #2 is not meant for that..
Aug 16 12:11:20 <rgrunber>	or no.. comment#1.. yeah.. 2nd thing in the bug
Aug 16 12:11:42 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, sorry for the confusion, I was commenting on the 499744 page for another bug
Aug 16 12:21:12 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: the functionality worked before https://git.eclipse.org/r/76610/ so i'd like at the explorer code from there.
Aug 16 12:21:22 <rgrunber>	in fact.. this looks pretty suspect : https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76610/8/containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/views/DockerExplorerView.java
Aug 16 12:21:38 <xcoulon>	jeez...
Aug 16 12:22:03 <xcoulon>	why did I do that ??
Aug 16 12:22:08 <xcoulon>	sigh...
Aug 16 12:22:10 <rgrunber>	testing?
Aug 16 12:23:41 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I'm not sure. I probably thought these lines where useless in my use-case… 
Aug 16 12:24:25 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: the good news is: I just wrote an SWTBot test that reproduced the problem and that verified that uncommenting the 3 lines actually resolves the problem
Aug 16 12:25:18 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: so now, let me run the whole suite of tests again and then I'll push to gerrit
Aug 16 12:25:37 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I won't touch my laptop for ~10min while the tests are running
Aug 16 12:29:36 <rgrunber>	k. you could also try creating some fake display (Xvnc/Xvfb) and then just pass the display # to the mvn call, or in the junit launch config.. i usually do that.. especiall because running the full linuxtools+tests takes a while. 
Aug 16 12:30:51 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to fuhbot2
Aug 16 12:36:07 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, I should try to see if it's doable on MacOSX
Aug 16 12:43:03 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I'm pushing the fix for 499744 on gerrit.
Aug 16 12:43:40 <xcoulon>	I just added you as a reviewer on it: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79147/
Aug 16 12:45:19 <rgrunber>	k
Aug 16 12:47:50 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: feel free to push https://git.eclipse.org/r/79130/ as well if you're fine with it.
Aug 16 12:48:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: ok, done ;-)
Aug 16 12:49:39 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: btw, I don't remember how/when the nightly update site is updated for the Docker tooling. Is it once a day, 3x a day or after each build ?
Aug 16 13:03:26 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: i'll have to trigger a build.. iirc it's only twice a day.
Aug 16 13:04:56 <rgrunber>	appears to be at 12pm or 6pm, if a change exists.
Aug 16 13:05:03 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: ok
Aug 16 13:15:17 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: ok, so build was successful and I merged the patch: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79147/
Aug 16 13:15:30 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: can you trigger a build for the Docker tooling ?
Aug 16 13:16:15 <rgrunber>	triggered.
Aug 16 13:16:21 <rgrunber>	https://hudson.eclipse.org/linuxtools/job/linuxtools-master/2574/
Aug 16 13:16:34 <rgrunber>	once it's done, content should be available under the updates-docker-nightly site.
Aug 16 13:19:50 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: awesome ! also, can I mark https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=499745 as fixed/resolved 
Aug 16 13:21:57 <rgrunber>	yeah.. we'd still need for reporter to confirm it's fixed for the windows one.
Aug 16 13:22:17 <xcoulon>	ok, so I'll leave it open and ask Martin to confirm it's fixed, then.
Aug 16 13:22:51 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I'm off for now.

Aug 22 12:27:26 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: also, I have serious internet connection issues here this week. Currently on tethering until a technician comes to see what's wrong with the network/cable. He's scheduled to come on Friday only :-(
Aug 22 12:30:46 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: FYI, I'm working on https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=499749 and I hope I can have a patch later tonight or tomorrow morning, too.

Aug 23 11:32:08 <akurtakov>	xcoulon: he should be at LinuxCon which is in toronto this week
Aug 23 11:33:09 <xcoulon>	akurtakov: oh, I thought he said he was not going. I guess I misunderstood, then
Aug 23 11:33:43 <akurtakov>	hmm, I don't know I see in the team calendar leo, roland and martha going 
Aug 23 11:34:06 <xcoulon>	akurtakov: ok, I have to disconnectnow, but I'll join the channel later today to try to reach him
Aug 23 11:34:09 <xcoulon>	akurtakov: thanks !

Aug 23 13:30:04 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff ! I just saw that you merged the patch to support Docker Compose ! Thanks a lot !
Aug 23 13:30:38 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: also, I'm seeing some changes on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79490/ but I'm not sure what you did on patch set 2
Aug 23 13:31:17 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: and finally, do you need any help from me tonight for the RC1 build ?
Aug 23 13:32:05 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: or maybe patchset 2 for https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79490/ was just a rebase on master after you merged the patch for Docker Compose ?
Aug 23 13:39:14 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: are you here ?
Aug 23 13:39:38 <xcoulon>	(ha, that might be lunch time for you..)
Aug 23 14:14:31 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: yes, I was at a late lunch...I had to rebase your other patch as it collided with your Docker Compose patch
Aug 23 14:15:06 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I shouldn't require any help from you this evening...if I have build issues, I may contact you tomorrow morning
Aug 23 14:18:08 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I am getting "No Docker image selected" for your hierarchy patch no matter whether I choose an image in Explorer or Images view...any ideas?
Aug 23 15:02:17 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to akurtakov
Aug 23 15:19:20 <nboldt1>	anyone know which jenkins slaves (if any) have mock and rpmbuild installed on them? 
Aug 23 15:24:25 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello again ! 
Aug 23 15:25:05 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: so, do you need any help for the RC1 build today/this evening ?
Aug 23 15:25:31 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: hi...I managed to check in your other patch, but you need to eventually clean up the UI...the hierarchy view says no image selected even though an image can be selected in Explorer or Images view....perhaps it should just be empty
Aug 23 15:25:39 <xcoulon>	(damn… even pulling mails via phone is a pain..)
Aug 23 15:25:59 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: s
Aug 23 15:26:15 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I shouldn't require any help this evening, but perhaps tomorrow if I run into a problem
Aug 23 15:26:51 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok for the build. I'm not sure I understant what you mean by "the hierarchy view says no image selected even though an image can be selected in Explorer or Images view"
Aug 23 15:27:58 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: if hierarchy view is open on startup, it contains a msg saying "no image has been selected"...this occurs even if you select an image in the Explorer or Images views...it only fills in if you right-click an image in Explorer view and select Open Hierarchy View
Aug 23 15:28:53 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ha ok. So not a blocker for the RC1 build, then ?
Aug 23 15:28:59 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: correct
Aug 23 15:29:21 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: but open a bug to track it...also add support to Images view context menu
Aug 23 15:29:44 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok, sure
Aug 23 15:32:12 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok so my connection is so slow that BZ does not even load the page to open new issues. I'll look at that tomorrow morning
Aug 23 15:32:26 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: ok
Aug 23 15:33:36 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: I'm off for this evening, then. I'll check my mails tomorrow morning to see if there's anything to do for the RC1 build
Aug 23 15:33:40 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: have a good afternoon/night
Aug 23 15:33:44 <jjohnstn>	you too
Aug 23 15:36:27 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: thanks ! Regarding the Image Hierarchy view message, what would you suggest ? I'm not sure we should support the link to the explorer view/images view/containers view selection. Should I just change the message to something more specific/less confusing ?
Aug 23 15:37:00 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I think leave it empty and don't open the view by default
Aug 23 15:37:15 <xcoulon>	(since BZ finally responded, I'm going to fill the issues now)
Aug 23 15:37:54 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: well, I'm just surprised that it was open by default. I'll need to check that. Maybe there's a setting in the plugin.xml that I copied from the Explorer view..
Aug 23 15:38:01 <xcoulon>	but I see what you mean
Aug 23 15:38:20 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: the workspace could have remembered it being open
Aug 23 15:39:40 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: yes, maybe. So I opened https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500159 . Feel free to comment ;-)
Aug 23 15:39:49 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: that's all for me now. Bye !
Aug 23 15:41:21 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: so RC1 bits are live some time tomorrow?
Aug 23 15:41:39 <nboldt1>	s/are/will be
Aug 23 15:46:23 <jjohnstn>	nboldt1: yes, tomorrow before 5 pm
Aug 23 15:50:47 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: great!

Aug 24 09:47:23 <scela>	mistria: hey
Aug 24 09:47:32 <mistria>	scela: hi!
Aug 24 09:47:34 <scela>	will you have time in the near future to push the example projects to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=499811
Aug 24 09:47:46 <scela>	i have some strange issue with the CLA-now ECA
Aug 24 09:51:11 <scela>	mistria: i think i fixed it. had to invalidate and sign again.
Aug 24 09:51:14 <scela>	so I'll do it myself
Aug 24 09:51:33 <mistria>	scela: so it was removed from the initial contribution, right?
Aug 24 09:51:34 <akurtakov>	scela: your counting is weird :)
Aug 24 09:51:44 <akurtakov>	two members - Dani, Alex and Lars :)
Aug 24 09:52:09 <scela>	akurtakov: yeah I forgot one and added it only in one place :)
Aug 24 09:52:24 <scela>	mistria: yes
Aug 24 09:52:40 <scela>	we need refactoring in bugzilla
Aug 24 09:52:52 <scela>	akurtakov: ^
Aug 24 09:54:39 <mistria>	scela: ok. I'm working on setting up a patch with examples as a child of current patch set 25
Aug 24 09:54:50 <mistria>	scela: in a separate commit/review
Aug 24 09:55:50 <mistria>	scela: by the way, I believe I've achieved a major step forward regarding language servers
Aug 24 09:56:09 <mistria>	scela: use can now define a LaunchConfiguration which is a language server and associate it with the content type of their choice
Aug 24 09:56:26 <mistria>	scela: so if you want to add support for a new language server, you can do it without installing anything
Aug 24 09:56:48 <scela>	mistria: nice
Aug 24 09:56:53 <scela>	is it in the github so I can try it?
Aug 24 09:56:58 <mistria>	is it only me or Gerrit isn't reachable via CLI/HTTP
Aug 24 09:57:03 <mistria>	yes, it's on GitHub
Aug 24 09:57:19 <mistria>	CLI/SSH sorry
Aug 24 09:57:43 <scela>	mistria: I'll give it a look
Aug 24 09:57:54 <scela>	mistria: I'm still stuck waiting on dani to review the patch
Aug 24 09:58:01 <scela>	to get the editor infrastructure in
Aug 24 09:58:21 <scela>	that would also be quite nice to have. hopefully we have it in M2.
Aug 24 09:58:47 <scela>	mistria: don't know about CLI on gerrit, i use only http
Aug 24 09:59:02 <mistria>	Gerrit is back for me
Aug 24 09:59:17 <mistria>	Yeah, I'm also frustrated to have to wait for Dani
Aug 24 09:59:28 <mistria>	but at least, he cares about it
Aug 24 09:59:31 <mistria>	that's a good thing ;)
Aug 24 09:59:47 <mistria>	it means he's going to really review it, one day
Aug 24 10:01:12 <scela>	mistria: once we have that part in it will 'release' us to focus on some consumption scenarios to feed to p.ui or p.text
Aug 24 10:01:55 <mistria>	scela: Dani told me that the .project editor would be sufficient to feed platform.whatever
Aug 24 10:02:30 <scela>	mistria: 'sufficient' to get it in. but it would be nice to have more in order to put it under lots of use case scenarios
Aug 24 10:02:44 <scela>	mistria: a. loskutov was pretty happy about it and he wanted more
Aug 24 10:02:50 <scela>	like .classpath editor etc.
Aug 24 10:07:22 <mistria>	scela: enjoy https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79630/
Aug 24 10:08:06 <mistria>	scela: doesn't JDT already contribute a correct editor for .classpath? Also, the Project Settings page is IMO perfect at doing it.
Aug 24 10:10:41 <scela>	mistria: no i don't think there is a .classpath textual editor
Aug 24 10:10:49 <scela>	they are usually opened in plain text
Aug 24 10:11:06 <scela>	mistria: yeah the settings are a way to do it, but that's also true for .project
Aug 24 10:11:16 <scela>	it's more an alternative way than a feature addition
Aug 24 10:12:24 <mistria>	scela: a project settings page would be perfect for .project too: http://eclip.se/102527
Aug 24 10:15:43 <scela>	mistria: the only thing lacking is the nature AFAICS
Aug 24 10:16:17 <akurtakov>	scela: mistria: if you look for real world test case for the editor stuff - ant editor is probably quite good for that purpose
Aug 24 10:16:31 <akurtakov>	plain editor reimplementing everything from scratch IIRC
Aug 24 10:16:47 <scela>	akurtakov: can the ant editor give me autocomplete on natures?
Aug 24 10:17:10 <mistria>	akurtakov: Ant sucks and is not much used at the moment; I don't think it would bring that much value
Aug 24 10:17:26 <mistria>	akurtakov: FYI, my current main editor for testing language server is a C# one
Aug 24 10:17:48 <mistria>	akurtakov: I have diagnostics, completion, hover, Find References, Open Declaration
Aug 24 10:17:55 <mistria>	akurtakov: working on Refactoring
Aug 24 10:18:16 <akurtakov>	mistria: I see, I was thinking for the case where you need a use case in platform itself and you can try way more things with the ant editor than with .project editor
Aug 24 10:18:38 <scela>	mistria: have you thought about whether we can contribute some of that C# stuff to some real eclipse project once the editor infra is in?
Aug 24 10:19:18 <mistria>	scela: the general binding with language servers can be contributed, it's only using Eclipse's API
Aug 24 10:20:10 <scela>	mistria: which project are you thinking of to contribute that part?
Aug 24 10:20:16 <mistria>	scela: For the C# part, we can ship a plugin that tries to detect some OmniSharp version and create the launch configuration and association, in an IStartup
Aug 24 10:20:45 <mistria>	scela: VSCode team people told me that soon, the dotnet SDK will ship a language server out of the box
Aug 24 10:20:51 <mistria>	scela: ie, no OmniSharp
Aug 24 10:21:24 <mistria>	scela: plain dotnet commands, that we can easily set up as launch configurations
Aug 24 10:21:33 <mistria>	scela: about a target project, I don't know
Aug 24 10:21:40 <mistria>	scela: Platform is IMO too low level.
Aug 24 10:21:51 <mistria>	scela: Maybe DLTK would be a good fit
Aug 24 10:21:56 <mistria>	scela: or create a new one...
Aug 24 10:22:07 <scela>	akurtakov: do you think DLTK is a fit? ^
Aug 24 10:22:41 <scela>	mistria: it's nice they'll make it easier. i wiped my packages twice trying to set up omnisharp on fedora
Aug 24 10:23:20 <akurtakov>	mistria: scela: could be, it was supposed to serve such usecases
Aug 24 10:23:45 <mistria>	akurtakov: nice!
Aug 24 10:23:54 <akurtakov>	with that said, I don't know what exactly do you want to contribute in eclipse land
Aug 24 10:24:25 <mistria>	akurtakov: as soon as the lsp4j project is provisioned at Eclipse.org and Platform intergrated the Generic editor, the language server support for Generic Editor can be moved to DLTK then
Aug 24 10:24:43 <mistria>	akurtakov: it's https://github.com/eclipselabs/eclipse-language-service
Aug 24 10:25:04 <akurtakov>	mistria: so basically that is hooking lsp4j in the generic editor?
Aug 24 10:25:09 <scela>	akurtakov: yes
Aug 24 10:25:19 <akurtakov>	sounds good
Aug 24 10:25:51 <scela>	akurtakov: generic editor can have any source, language servers are one. the code to bind to language servers will have to go to somewhere.
Aug 24 10:26:14 <scela>	by 'source' i mean source of information on coloring autocomplete etc. :)
Aug 24 10:35:30 <maxandersen>	mistria why would we not want the generic editor in eclipse platform ? 
Aug 24 10:36:05 <akurtakov>	maxandersen: not the generic editor but it's hook to language server
Aug 24 10:36:17 <mistria>	maxandersen: you misread some comments: generic editor in Platform, lsp-based extensions into DLTK
Aug 24 10:37:09 <maxandersen>	@akurtakov okey - as long as it does not require installing all the existing stuff in DLTK that can work. 
Aug 24 10:37:21 <maxandersen>	but where would i.e. json language server live ? 
Aug 24 10:37:29 <maxandersen>	language server based editor i mean.
Aug 24 10:37:35 <maxandersen>	would that be in WTP or DLTK ? 
Aug 24 10:37:40 <akurtakov>	that's entirely different question 
Aug 24 10:38:13 <maxandersen>	akurtakov okey, then I don't grok what is suggested to be in dltk ? 
Aug 24 10:38:15 <mistria>	maxandersen: specific "connections" or server would most likely go into WTP
Aug 24 10:38:40 <mistria>	maxandersen: the language server client for Eclipse Platform generic editor
Aug 24 10:38:48 <mistria>	maxandersen: which isn't language-specific
Aug 24 10:38:51 <maxandersen>	mistria okey, so WTP would need to depend on DLTK to get what it needs, mnot just platform ? 
Aug 24 10:39:10 <mistria>	maxandersen: if they want to pick the language server support, yes
Aug 24 10:39:26 <mistria>	maxandersen: there is IMO no way to have this language server support in Platform
Aug 24 10:39:27 <maxandersen>	ookey, so back to again - why not have that in the platform.
Aug 24 10:39:37 <mistria>	maxandersne: but maybe akurtakov have a different opinion
Aug 24 10:39:41 <maxandersen>	just like syntax highlghting is in the platform.
Aug 24 10:39:48 <maxandersen>	sourceviewerconfiguration
Aug 24 10:40:12 <mistria>	maxandersen: those don't depend on an external protocol or api, that's I believe what can make a difference
Aug 24 10:40:20 <maxandersen>	I honestly think if we put LPS stuff in higher level projects we'll not get the benefirts from it.
Aug 24 10:40:21 <akurtakov>	we wanted to create ide-commons for that sole purpose to hoste launchbar, remote, templates and eventually this one
Aug 24 10:40:27 <mistria>	maxandersen: but if platform is fine with keeping the LSP client, why not
Aug 24 10:40:27 <akurtakov>	but never got to it
Aug 24 10:41:00 <maxandersen>	akurtakov yes, which is why I was hopening putting it in platform would hav emore success ;)
Aug 24 10:41:01 <akurtakov>	I'm not convinced about lsp in platfrom yet
Aug 24 10:41:23 <akurtakov>	how much influence can community have over lsp?
Aug 24 10:41:41 <akurtakov>	is it 100% one company controlled?
Aug 24 10:41:53 <akurtakov>	as long as that's true I don't see it coming into platform
Aug 24 10:41:58 <mistria>	maxandersen akurtakov: I believe the API and release rules in Platform wouldn't fit for such a technology that's prone to evolve a lot
Aug 24 10:42:30 <akurtakov>	at least that's the PMC opinion from previous meetings
Aug 24 10:42:37 <mistria>	akurtakov maxandersen: could be in the e4.ui repository, that's where I've put all my mess lately ;)
Aug 24 10:44:02 <scela>	mistria: i'd rather not have it into an incubation-level project
Aug 24 10:44:10 <akurtakov>	being in e4.ui has the nasty incubation thing
Aug 24 10:44:41 <akurtakov>	which would prevent using it in e.g. linuxtools for the dockereditor or in dltk ruby and etc.
Aug 24 10:45:46 <mistria>	maybe just lsp4j would be fine
Aug 24 10:46:01 <mistria>	they'd have their plain API in one repo, and another repo for the Eclipse integration
Aug 24 10:46:22 <mistria>	after all, it's where this would make the more sense
Aug 24 10:46:41 <scela>	mistria: which repos do you mean in either case?
Aug 24 10:46:59 <mistria>	lsp4j.core, lsp4j.eclipse.ui
Aug 24 10:47:06 <mistria>	(imagining here)
Aug 24 10:48:01 <maxandersen>	mistria the platform needs to find a way to ship things that moves faster into the release train ;)
Aug 24 10:48:51 <akurtakov>	maxandersen: that has been also discussed multiple times - there is no issue with that other than no one to act on real releng tasks to make this happen
Aug 24 10:49:37 <akurtakov>	so we have the agreement this has to happen and all available resources at 150% at other tasks
Aug 24 10:50:17 <akurtakov>	so nothing happens
Aug 24 10:50:39 <akurtakov>	as it's more important keeping what we have now not breaking
Aug 24 10:52:21 <akurtakov>	maxandersen: I'm with you on that but if we want it to happen we have huge backlog to fight first
Aug 24 10:53:11 <akurtakov>	e.g. even for Neon we lifted the limit to what can be backported so Neon.1...n will be more important releases
Aug 24 10:53:26 <akurtakov>	but we face the issue of not having who to do the actual backports
Aug 24 10:53:45 <maxandersen>	agreed - if putting in platform is impossible then need to find another place to host it - DLTK for me just seem so foreign and seperated ;)
Aug 24 10:54:00 <maxandersen>	but if it could be done in DLTK similar to how docker tools was done in linux tools then great.
Aug 24 10:54:22 <maxandersen>	ie. docker was just put in linux tools so it could be released, but no actual connection to linux tools.
Aug 24 10:54:43 <akurtakov>	maxandersen: I really don't have preference over lsp4j and dltk 
Aug 24 10:55:05 <akurtakov>	if lsp4j folks are not fine with having it we should be able to sneak it into dltk so we can release it
Aug 24 10:55:37 <maxandersen>	you guys are aware gorkem is being asked by IBM to contribute the jdt-server implementation to JDT ...that will not use lsp4j anytime soon. 
Aug 24 10:55:40 <akurtakov>	maxandersen: it's not that it's important to put into platform it just requires more effort 
Aug 24 10:56:29 <maxandersen>	and he is working on a propsoal for that.
Aug 24 10:56:47 <akurtakov>	my impression was that lsp4j was more for client side implementation
Aug 24 10:57:22 <akurtakov>	when for server side you can implement protocol easier and faster without such abstractions
Aug 24 10:59:32 <akurtakov>	also lsp4j had this xtend/xtext dep, right? 
Aug 24 10:59:55 <akurtakov>	we already suffer from the emf/platform circular dep so adding one more is definetely bad idea
Aug 24 11:01:31 <akurtakov>	and again platform and jdt are built together (due to historical reasons) and breaking this circle requires effort
Aug 24 11:01:45 <akurtakov>	once this done - jdt could use way more deps 
Aug 24 11:02:48 <akurtakov>	everytime one adds such "innocent" small circle dep he/she slows the next iteration significantly
Aug 24 11:06:39 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to jjohnstn_
Aug 24 11:48:54 <maxandersen>	akurtakov yes, lsp4j has this dep and why I find it not useful for me ;)
Aug 24 12:31:05 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to ebaron
Aug 24 12:42:56 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff. Have you tried the support for creating a connection from environment variables in the clipboard ? It does not seem to work here and it breaks a test
Aug 24 12:43:24 <xcoulon>	do you know how it is supposed to work ? copy values from CLI and paste in the Docker Explorer view ?
Aug 24 12:44:23 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ha, never mind, I see it works from a runtime Eclipse. Now I need to figure out why the test fails
Aug 24 12:44:49 <jjohnstn|wfh>	xcoulon: I am at home and forgot to shut down my work IRC
Aug 24 12:45:01 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: oh, you're on PTO ?
Aug 24 12:45:09 <jjohnstn|wfh>	xcoulon: no, just working from home
Aug 24 12:45:15 <xcoulon>	ha ok
Aug 24 12:45:29 <xcoulon>	so I should ping you on jjohnstn|wfh. got it
Aug 24 12:45:38 <jjohnstn|wfh>	yup
Aug 24 12:46:07 <xcoulon>	anyway, I'll try to see why it fails here. In the mean time, I'll push a patch on gerrit to see if the build succeeds
Aug 24 12:46:07 <jjohnstn|wfh>	xcoulon: the build should be aggregated from last night...do we need to update a JIRA?
Aug 24 12:46:26 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn|wfh: if you can update them, please, yes
Aug 24 12:46:46 <xcoulon>	I'm still connecting via my phone, so can you do it ?
Aug 24 12:48:32 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn|wfh: so from my understanding, we're good for Neon.1.RC1, right ?
Aug 24 12:51:09 <jjohnstn|wfh>	I'll let nboldt know...the docker stuff is found at: http://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools/update-neon-1-docker-rc1
Aug 24 12:51:32 <jjohnstn|wfh>	xcoulon: yes
Aug 24 12:53:01 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn|wfh: great ! so I'll logoff for today. spend a bit of time with wife and kids as they just came back from 4 days away from home ;-)
Aug 24 12:53:11 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn|wfh: I'll see you tomorrow
Aug 24 12:53:13 <xcoulon>	bye
Aug 24 12:53:48 <jjohnstn|wfh>	xcoulon: enjoy
Aug 24 12:55:58 <xcoulon1>	jjohnstn|wfh: thanks ! have a good afternoon
Aug 24 12:59:37 <nboldt>	jjohnstn jjohnstn|wfh contents are live and ready for me to mirror into JBT TP?
Aug 24 13:00:19 <nboldt>	p2browser shows contents built last night ~10pm. 
Aug 24 13:01:00 <nboldt>	jjohnstn jjohnstn|wfh: so just wanted to confirm the site won't be updated later today as you'd said 5pm was the cutoff time and it's only 1pm now :D
Aug 24 14:05:42 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: I'm going to assume your silence = my assumption is correct and the site is complete and ready for use
Aug 24 14:43:55 <jjohnstn|wfh>	nboldt: yes, sorry, I was afk and forgot to denote it
Aug 24 14:47:24 <jjohnstn|wfh>	nboldt: yes, sorry, I was afk and forgot to denote it
Aug 24 15:06:21 <jjohnstn|wfh>	nboldt: to confirm...last night's build is the one I aggregated
Aug 24 15:07:52 <nboldt>	jjohnstn|wfh: thanks, I'm mirroring it now
Aug 24 15:09:17 <nboldt>	jjohnstn|wfh: do you forsee another update next week?
Aug 24 15:10:13 <jjohnstn|wfh>	nboldt: we are on a weekly rc1 schedule...next week is RC2, then a week later RC3, then finally a week after that RC4 which will become our Neon.1 5.1.0 release
Aug 24 15:10:21 <jjohnstn|wfh>	nboldt: so yet
Aug 24 15:10:25 <jjohnstn|wfh>	nboldt: so yes
Aug 24 15:10:33 <nboldt>	jjohnstn|wfh: ok, thanks

Aug 24 18:25:54 <strykerawb>	however i'm not seeing it available in public api

Aug 25 09:38:33 <xcoulon>	but it is in spotify client's MANIFEST.MF: org.bouncycastle.asn1.pkcs;version="
Aug 25 09:38:35 <xcoulon>	 [1.51,2)
Aug 25 09:38:56 <xcoulon>	and org.bouncycastle.openssl;version="[1.51,2)
Aug 25 09:39:46 <rgrunber>	docker.core doesn't depend on bouncycastle.
Aug 25 09:39:52 <rgrunber>	only docker-client
Aug 25 09:40:06 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, my bad. I was too quick
Aug 25 09:40:48 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I was afraid that we missed something on the Docker tooling side, but I suspect the problem that our colleague has is related to his TP
Aug 25 09:41:33 <rgrunber>	i'd have to look into it but according to what i wrote 1.51 has PEMParser and we certainly require it according to that through docker-client.
Aug 25 09:41:42 <rgrunber>	perhaps they're using an older docker-client, or something..
Aug 25 09:42:05 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, there seems to be something wrong somewhere
Aug 25 09:47:22 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: btw, docker.editor is still in version 1.0.0 and docker.doc is in version 2.0.0. Maybe we should align them with the others (2.1.0) ?

Aug 25 10:56:19 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: .. aren't you on pto today ?
Aug 25 10:56:31 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: tonight
Aug 25 10:56:45 <xcoulon>	until next Thursday (Sept 1st)
Aug 25 10:56:57 <rgrunber>	ah ok.

Aug 25 12:16:00 *	Now talking on #eclipse
Aug 25 12:16:00 *	Topic for #eclipse is: Eclipse discussions
Aug 25 12:16:00 *	Topic for #eclipse set by akurtakov!~akurtakov@vpn1-5-170.ams2.redhat.com (Tue May 17 08:53:56 2016)
Aug 25 12:16:01 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: what do you mean ?
Aug 25 12:16:25 <nboldt1>	why is the new bundle called "jdk15on" ?
Aug 25 12:16:39 <nboldt1>	was it compiled w/ JDK 1.5 instead of perhaps something newer ?
Aug 25 12:16:52 <nboldt1>	is it possible the class is not accessible to JDK 8?
Aug 25 12:17:03 <xcoulon>	O_O
Aug 25 12:17:13 *	nboldt1 is speculating wildly
Aug 25 12:17:32 <rgrunber>	i believe they're both the same jdk15on..  just the bsn that is different from when it was originally in orbit.
Aug 25 12:17:49 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I can't update my TP here because my phone is my modem, so rgrunber could you try that ?
Aug 25 12:18:16 <xcoulon>	try to create a connection in the Docker tooling when bouncycastle 1.52 is used
Aug 25 12:18:24 <nboldt1>	but in the docker tools RC1 site, the bundles don't have -jdk15on suffix in them
Aug 25 12:19:10 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: https://issues.jboss.org/secure/attachment/12408773/RC1vs0825N_sorted.txt (on the left is RC1 < and on the right is nightly >)
Aug 25 12:19:32 <nboldt1>	< org.bouncycastle.bcpkix [1.51.0.v201505131810] 
Aug 25 12:19:36 <nboldt1>	> org.bouncycastle.bcpkix-jdk15on [1.52.0.v20160323-2125] 
Aug 25 12:19:40 <nboldt1>	< org.bouncycastle.bcprov [1.51.0.v201505131810] 
Aug 25 12:19:41 <nboldt1>	> org.bouncycastle.bcprov-jdk15on [1.52.0.v20160323-2125]
Aug 25 12:19:55 <nboldt1>	so it's not QUITE the same :D
Aug 25 12:20:35 <rgrunber>	no but docker-client does an import-package so it wouldn't matter they both Export-Package the correct content.
Aug 25 12:23:04 <rgrunber>	i'll try out a connection against 1.52 to see since that'll pretty much decide it.
Aug 25 12:23:09 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: would you please review https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79638/
Aug 25 12:23:15 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: yeah, that's what I was expecting... though I'm really curious why the suffix is there and what it means
Aug 25 12:24:35 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: https://twitter.com/akurtakov/status/768736440398118912 pretty much gives you what to expect
Aug 25 12:24:35 <rgrunber>	but from my investigation i couldn't see any reason why the update from 1.51 to 1.52 would fail.. docker-client import packages to bouncycastle would still support 1.52 and the classes are in the same location so nothing like that should happen..
Aug 25 12:24:42 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: ah about the suffix..
Aug 25 12:24:51 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html
Aug 25 12:25:22 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: if you test the additional css file path too and please test I haven't broke 3.18 and older :)
Aug 25 12:25:52 <rgrunber>	15on -> JDK 1.5 and onward.
Aug 25 12:26:40 <nboldt1>	maybe they're not declared as singletons so both 1.51 and 1.52 are present in devstudio?
Aug 25 12:27:27 <akurtakov>	why should they be singletons?
Aug 25 12:27:30 <rgrunber>	they probably wouldn't be singletons.. as libraries
Aug 25 12:28:05 <rgrunber>	yeah.. so if the same classloader tried to load 2 different ones.. that could cause it..
Aug 25 12:32:09 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: can you comment on https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-23043 ?
Aug 25 12:32:27 <xcoulon>	I have to go for errands but I should be back after dinner (in 2-3hrs)
Aug 25 12:32:48 <rgrunber>	k i'll try and see what's wrong.
Aug 25 12:35:23 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok

Aug 25 12:39:40 <mbenitez>	mbooth, do you have access to BZ1367019 ?
Aug 25 12:42:56 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: thanks
Aug 25 12:43:00 <xcoulon>	see you later
Aug 25 12:47:28 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I think so
Aug 25 12:48:02 <mbenitez>	I can't access that or a few others in Martin's testing results
Aug 25 12:48:37 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Oh, maybe I see the problem "Groups: Red Hat Quality Assurance (internal)"
Aug 25 12:49:06 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Try now
Aug 25 12:49:07 <mbenitez>	mbooth, that sounds promising
Aug 25 12:49:50 <lufimtse>	mbooth, what was the link to the Trello board again?
Aug 25 12:49:54 <mbenitez>	mbooth, you got it! it works now, can I ask you to please change a few more? since you have QA rights :)
Aug 25 12:50:03 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Sure
Aug 25 12:50:16 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Although, I expected you to have more rights than me!
Aug 25 12:50:44 <mbooth>	lufimtse: This is the board I was looking at: https://trello.com/b/yugU3B6P/team-code
Aug 25 12:51:34 <mbenitez>	mbooth, maybe as component owner you are more trustworthy than me :) if you can: 1367354 1367471 1367667
Aug 25 12:53:07 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I fixed the last two, but even I am not authorised for 1367354 :-(
Aug 25 12:57:09 <mbenitez>	mbooth, thanks! I'll ask vkadlcik_gone tomorrow
Aug 25 12:58:11 *	fuhbot2 gives channel operator status to ebaron
Aug 25 13:27:37 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: mbooth: what's a good way to test whether the rh-eclipse46-devstudio rpm works as expected? I can launch it but ... then what? Asking because I have two versions of it now - one is 300M and one is bloated up to 460M
Aug 25 13:28:11 <nboldt1>	hope the smaller one works just as well as the big one since difference is duplicate IUs already installed via RPMs (eclipse-* packages)
Aug 25 13:28:19 <nboldt1>	ldimaggi: ^ same question for you
Aug 25 13:28:23 <mbooth>	nboldt1: I guess you can see if all your bundles are loaded?
Aug 25 13:29:00 <nboldt1>	you mean osgi console?
Aug 25 13:29:04 <mbooth>	Sure
Aug 25 13:29:22 <mbooth>	I mean, I don't know what devstudio includes, so I can't say if there are missing perspectives, menus, etc
Aug 25 13:30:07 <nboldt1>	mbooth: fair enough ... that's why I'm asking. I don't have a good "smoke test" other than "does it start and can I see Central / install stuff from there" which I use for staging & releasing builds
Aug 25 13:30:13 <ldimaggi>	nboldt1, what is in the extra 160MB? any ideas?
Aug 25 13:30:43 <nboldt1>	ldimaggi: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-3981?focusedCommentId=13283931&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13283931
Aug 25 13:30:58 <nboldt1>	yes, I know exactly what the 160M are. See attachmetns on the jira ;)
Aug 25 13:31:13 <mbooth>	nboldt1: I usually check to see there are no bundles in the "INSTALLED" state (that could not be resolved)
Aug 25 13:31:51 <nboldt1>	mbooth: I haven't used osgi console in AGES. can you pastebin me some commands you use to do that?
Aug 25 13:32:04 <mbooth>	ss -s INSTALLED
Aug 25 13:32:07 <nboldt1>	other than `./eclipse -console -consolelog -debug`
Aug 25 13:32:12 <nboldt1>	I see
Aug 25 13:35:24 <nboldt1>	mbooth: hmm. not sure if the RPM actually installs anything. When I launch /usr/bin/eclipse I only see Eclipse + EMF installed :(
Aug 25 13:36:10 <mbooth>	/usr/bin/eclipse ... ?
Aug 25 13:36:24 <nboldt1>	yes, isn't that where the rh-eclipse36-base is installed?
Aug 25 13:36:27 <nboldt1>	46*
Aug 25 13:36:33 <mbooth>	No
Aug 25 13:36:37 <nboldt1>	ah
Aug 25 13:36:42 <nboldt1>	so... then... where?
Aug 25 13:36:52 <rgrunber>	 /opt
Aug 25 13:36:59 <mbooth>	You can use the launcher from the gnome menu
Aug 25 13:37:07 <mbooth>	Or from the command line:
Aug 25 13:37:17 <mbooth>	scl enable rh-eclipse46 eclipse
Aug 25 13:37:30 <mbooth>	IIRC
Aug 25 13:38:59 <mbooth>	What rgrunber says
Aug 25 13:39:18 <rgrunber>	mbooth: executing '/opt' won't do much :P
Aug 25 13:39:31 <mbooth>	I mean for location :-p
Aug 25 13:39:36 <mbooth>	scl enable rh-eclipse46 'which eclipse' might do it
Aug 25 13:39:50 <nboldt1>	yeah, I looked in there and found a whole ./root/subtree/madness
Aug 25 13:40:05 <rgrunber>	but yeah it's in /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/lib64/eclipse/
Aug 25 13:40:37 <rgrunber>	the scl stuff just sets things like PATH and other env needed to resolve things nicely
Aug 25 13:40:53 <nboldt1>	so... that last one worked
Aug 25 13:40:57 <rgrunber>	if you need to test things from cli, really useful to do something like 'scl enable rh-eclipse46 bash', then go from there.
Aug 25 13:41:00 <nboldt1>	scl enable rh-eclipse46 `which eclipse` 
Aug 25 13:41:36 <nboldt1>	but the eclipse that's launched only has RCP, platform, help, and emf.{ecore,common}
Aug 25 13:41:52 <nboldt1>	that's pretty BASE. why no devstudio, I wonder
Aug 25 13:42:44 <nboldt1>	should I be building this in another scl thing?
Aug 25 13:42:53 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Try what rgrunber suggests, do "scl enable rh-eclipse46 bash" and then launch "eclipse" from there
Aug 25 13:42:55 <nboldt1>	eg., not rh-eclipse46 but rh-eclipse46-devstudio?
Aug 25 13:43:06 <mbooth>	The SCL needs to be enabled when you launch it
Aug 25 13:43:32 <mbooth>	The gnome launcher hides this from you
Aug 25 13:45:17 <nboldt1>	/opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/lib64/eclipse/plugins contains no devstudio. also not in droplets, dropins, etc.
Aug 25 13:45:53 <nboldt1>	so... I feel like my build script is producing something that yum/dnf/rpm is not installing correctly
Aug 25 13:45:59 <nboldt1>	mbooth: rgrunber: ^
Aug 25 13:46:57 <rgrunber>	if you're installing an rpm, does rpm -ql $rpm say anything about where the contents are ?
Aug 25 13:48:05 <nboldt1>	/opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/eclipse/droplets/devstudio/...
Aug 25 13:48:34 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Hmm, and those dirs/files listed do not exist on disk?
Aug 25 13:48:42 <nboldt1>	it does. yes
Aug 25 13:49:07 <nboldt1>	 but /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/lib64/eclipse/ is not the same as /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/eclipse/
Aug 25 13:50:39 <mbooth>	Oh I see, usr/share is used for architecture independent droplets, usr/lib64 for dropins that contain architecture-specific bits
Aug 25 13:50:56 <mbooth>	s/dropins/droplets/
Aug 25 13:51:34 <mbooth>	So it seems installed correctly then
Aug 25 13:51:49 <nboldt1>	then why don't I see any of that when I fire up eclipse?
Aug 25 13:52:24 <mbooth>	nboldt1: I am just downloading your rpm from the jira ticket to see, is that correct rpm to test?
Aug 25 13:52:35 <nboldt1>	which one? there are 2 linked there
Aug 25 13:52:49 <mbooth>	Latest: http://wonka.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/RHDS/10.0/snapshots/builds/20160824-2319/
Aug 25 13:52:58 <nboldt1>	that's the bigger one at 460M
Aug 25 13:53:07 <nboldt1>	I'm hoping the 300M one will work too
Aug 25 13:53:18 <nboldt1>	http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.rpm_master/20160824-2110/ << from there
Aug 25 13:57:16 <mbooth>	nboldt1, rgrunber: Okay I will go for dinner while this downloads, if no-one has any ideas when I get back I will investigate further :-)
Aug 25 13:57:39 <rgrunber>	nearly done downloading.. 20s.
Aug 25 13:57:40 <nboldt1>	mbooth: all I get is the splash screen but it doesn't seem it's ever going to start
Aug 25 13:58:36 <mbooth>	rgrunber: You win the chance to investigate then, I think VPN is a bottleneck for me
Aug 25 13:58:40 <mbooth>	;-)
Aug 25 13:58:53 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: what version of 'eclipse-platform'
Aug 25 13:59:43 <nboldt1>	Installed Packages
Aug 25 13:59:43 <nboldt1>	Name        : eclipse-platform

Aug 25 13:59:44 <nboldt1>	Release     : 3.fc24
Aug 25 14:04:27 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: could you try against http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=793168 ?
Aug 25 14:04:41 <rgrunber>	i'llbe pushing that to bodhi very soon.
Aug 25 14:05:10 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: how do I make dnf find that version?
Aug 25 14:08:09 <rgrunber>	they're not in any repo even that koji would have so you'll have to manually download those.
Aug 25 14:14:55 <nboldt1>	all of them? ugh. 
Aug 25 14:15:05 <nboldt1>	anyway, after a few mins devstudio DID start up
Aug 25 14:15:14 <nboldt1>	rather, Eclipse started and it includes devstudio features
Aug 25 14:15:23 <nboldt1>	but I've found like 4 other problems :D
Aug 25 14:15:45 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: which ones ?
Aug 25 14:16:07 <nboldt1>	I'll open JIRAs
Aug 25 14:16:12 <nboldt1>	with screenshots n' shit
Aug 25 14:16:38 <rgrunber>	can you try -6 just to confirm they aren't solved by that ? are they only UI problems ?
Aug 25 14:30:18 <nboldt1>	they don't look like UI problems
Aug 25 14:30:28 <nboldt1>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-3982 contains 3 new subtasks, rgrunber

Aug 25 14:31:45 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: do you at least have a bash script to scrape the koji page for rpm links, and curl them all ?
Aug 25 14:48:39 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: there's 'koji download-build $buildid'
Aug 25 14:49:09 <rgrunber>	ughh one sec.

Aug 25 15:40:17 <xcoulon>	I see that you just merged https://git.eclipse.org/r/79650 ?
Aug 25 15:40:30 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: you mean JIRAs? I have

Aug 25 15:41:23 <xcoulon>	it's in another patch: 
Aug 25 15:41:30 <xcoulon>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/79699
Aug 25 15:41:44 <xcoulon>	that one you can review and merge as well
Aug 25 15:41:54 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: ok

Aug 25 15:42:15 <xcoulon>	s/greatm/great
Aug 25 15:42:42 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: anyway, if you can rebase any patches, it makes life easier for me to review
Aug 25 15:43:32 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: sure ! let me do that. Wasn't it the case for the one you just reviewed ? 
Aug 25 15:43:52 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: no, it applied cleanly
Aug 25 15:44:02 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok, cool
Aug 25 15:44:50 <xcoulon>	btw, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500298 should be fixed with one of today's patches
Aug 25 15:49:52 <xcoulon>	mmh, not sure…
Aug 25 16:35:17 <xcoulon1>	jjohnstn: I just pushed an update of the patch for BZ 500158
Aug 25 16:35:50 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon1: ok, thx
Aug 25 16:39:53 <xcoulon1>	jjohnstn: did you need my review on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79768/ or is it just a cherry-pick from my patch to apply on stable-5.1 ?
Aug 25 16:40:35 <jjohnstn>	it is a cherry pick
Aug 25 16:40:48 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon1: ^
Aug 25 16:52:40 <xcoulon1>	jjohnstn: ok, great

Aug 26 11:04:12 <mbenitez>	lufimtse, thank you for receiving the remaining stuff from the conference!
Aug 26 11:06:17 <lufimtse>	^.^, well, I actually stepped out for a bit to pay rent for the apartment I'm moving in to, but it made it here never the less.
Aug 26 11:30:20 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to mbenitez
Aug 26 11:36:13 <mbenitez>	lufimtse, give trello another try now
Aug 26 11:38:37 <lufimtse>	kk

Aug 26 11:42:33 <lufimtse>	mbenitez, that worked. I added a card for the webkit port.
Aug 26 11:42:45 <lufimtse>	Will post comments as I make progress.
Aug 26 11:43:08 <mbenitez>	lufimtse, good, and thanks for getting this started
Aug 26 15:03:55 <mbenitez>	nboldt, nice progress on the rpm, it's encouraging to see the changes
Aug 26 15:17:46 <nboldt>	mbenitez: thanks

Aug 29 09:37:52 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: can't you regenerate the mac/win files oyurself?
Aug 29 09:38:12 <akurtakov_>	if you use .classpath_win32/cocoa and rebuild?
Aug 29 09:45:29 <lufimtse>	hmm
Aug 29 09:45:39 <lufimtse>	I could probably
Aug 29 09:45:43 <lufimtse>	never thought of it
Aug 29 09:45:46 <lufimtse>	let me try
Aug 29 09:53:12 *	fuhbot gives channel operator status to patrickm
Aug 29 10:02:47 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, can't seem to get it to work. When using .classpath_cocoa, swt just throws lots of errors in my face and changes to OS.java on mac side don't seem to get the desired effect. Have you ever got it to work?
Aug 29 10:03:05 <akurtakov_>	never tried 
Aug 29 10:03:12 <akurtakov_>	just thought it should work :)
Aug 29 10:03:24 <lufimtse>	X-D
Aug 29 10:04:07 <lufimtse>	I could boot into my OS X os, (I still have OS X installed as fallback) and re-compile there, but I figured it might be easier for someone with Cocoa dev experience to refresh bindings.

Aug 29 12:37:07 <rgrunber>	akazakov: could you add jjohnstn@redhat.com to the developer group on trello ? (noticed you have admin perms on it)
Aug 29 12:44:42 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, just added him to the board, we'll need somebody with permissions to add Jeff and others as official team members
Aug 29 12:45:45 <rgrunber>	ah good call, seems any member can add someone to the board.. just the team needs probably admin or something.
Aug 29 12:47:48 <mbenitez>	exactly
Aug 29 16:34:18 <lufimtse>	@anyone: In eclipse, some folders can be marked as derived, so that they don't show up in searches. Is there a way to see all folders that you marked as derived?
Aug 30 09:56:56 <mbenitez>	lufimtse, we replied to Eric almost a t the same time :D
Aug 30 10:05:36 <lufimtse>	:-D
Aug 30 10:40:33 <mbenitez>	ipun, you should be able to access the trello board now
Aug 30 10:41:55 <ipun>	mbenitez: in now, thanks!
Aug 30 10:42:05 <mbenitez>	good, np!
Aug 30 12:03:48 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: on track for a release of Docker Tooling RC2 on/before tomorrow @ noon?
Aug 30 12:24:03 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: should be
Aug 30 12:27:36 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: great, thanks
Aug 30 16:20:10 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: running into problem running gerrit due to being unable to load the launchbar-master repo in linuxtools-e4.6.target...any ideas?
Aug 30 16:39:01 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: is gerrit hanging ?
Aug 30 16:39:31 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: no, it fails...now I am having trouble just connecting to hudson.eclipse.org via browser
Aug 30 16:43:55 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: browser is ok now
Aug 30 16:44:19 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: also about the e-mail, i'm not sure where those are coming from.. even the latest I-build from Orbit doesn't include jackson 2.6.0.
Aug 30 16:45:10 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: gerrit keeps getting no route to host for https://hudson.eclipse.org
Aug 30 16:45:52 <rgrunber>	yeah i would restar the build.. it failed with No route to host...
Aug 30 16:47:15 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I have restarted multiple times and still the same error
Aug 30 16:47:54 <rgrunber>	ah.. well https://hudson.eclipse.org/ definitely seems down to me.
Aug 30 16:48:20 <rgrunber>	even though the service itself is up
Aug 30 17:00:49 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: the 2.6.0 stuff is coming from the downloads/apitools/linuxtools-2.0.0.zip which is owned by you...any ideas?
Aug 30 17:04:39 <rgrunber>	ah linuxtools-docker-2.0.0.zip
Aug 30 17:05:40 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: can we remove it?
Aug 30 17:05:46 <rgrunber>	nothing in apitools is being shipped.. can we just get rid of them for now?... yeah..
Aug 30 17:07:16 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I can't remove it...it is owned by you with no group privileges
Aug 30 17:07:23 <rgrunber>	we will need uses-cqs for bounycastle 1.52.. unless i just patch linuxtools to use the older one
Aug 30 17:08:07 <rgrunber>	k i'll remove it then.
Aug 30 17:08:37 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: thx...regarding bouncycastle...your pick...I suggest opening the CQ...do you need me to do it?
Aug 30 17:09:37 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: if you can go ahead. it's only needed for bcprov and bcpkix.
Aug 30 17:13:37 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: k the file should be gone.
Aug 30 17:13:51 <jjohnstn>	ok, thx
Aug 30 17:16:14 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: oh and swtchart.. hmm
Aug 30 17:18:13 <rgrunber>	swtchart 0.10.0 is in Orbit now.. my guess is we grab it because our deps only specify a lower limit.
Aug 30 17:18:37 <rgrunber>	it's brough in by tracecompass not us but out target platform picks it up.
Aug 30 17:26:49 <jjohnstn>	I have opened USE CQs for bcprov, bcpkix, and swtchart
Aug 30 17:27:01 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: ^
Aug 30 17:32:18 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: 5.1.0 is based off of the stable-5.0 branch right ?
Aug 30 17:32:35 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: no, stable-5.1 branch
Aug 30 17:32:42 <rgrunber>	ah yes, that one.
Aug 30 17:34:35 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I can't even get to linuxtools dashboard anymore and no response on the mailing list or from emo
Aug 30 17:35:43 <rgrunber>	yeah good call on the explanation.. i couldn't understand why they're flagging bcprov, bcpkix, slf4j.api when those are only for oxygen.
Aug 30 17:35:58 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: we have some issues with our build...Hudson is not working...gerrit can't connect to one of the repos we access...I can't guarantee we will be ready by noon anymore
Aug 30 17:36:34 <rgrunber>	so slf4j.api is another but afaict only the nighlies pull from the Orbit I-build
Aug 30 17:37:25 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: do I need to do an slf4j.api CQ?
Aug 30 17:37:46 <rgrunber>	you would for oxygen, but that isn't going into Neon.1
Aug 30 17:48:56 <rgrunber>	welp.. apparently Doug says Marketplace is down too..
Aug 30 19:11:29 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: awesome. OK, thx for the heads up
Aug 31 10:34:08 <scela>	mbenitez: will this telephony problem going around impact our ability to hold the meeting?
Aug 31 10:34:40 <rgrunber>	hmm not if we do a pure bjn and skip phones..
Aug 31 10:34:57 <mbenitez>	scela, if you use the polycom phone yes, but bluejeans seems to be working
Aug 31 10:35:16 <scela>	mbenitez: i don't have polycom but i had the feeling you use them in the conference room
Aug 31 10:35:21 <rgrunber>	i prefer to dial in with the phone and use laptop only for video but we could try all from laptop.
Aug 31 10:35:28 <mbenitez>	what Roland says may be the only issue, we may have to use only computers
Aug 31 10:35:39 <scela>	also mbooth usually joins by phone
Aug 31 10:35:57 <mbenitez>	scela, we'll figure it out, we have a few laptops around to get around this
Aug 31 10:36:24 <rgrunber>	but it may be only the office phone networks affected.. the bjn call service infrastructure is on the blujeans side right ?
Aug 31 10:36:53 *	rgrunber dials 
Aug 31 10:36:55 <scela>	mbenitez: ok, just wanted to bring it up so we don't waste time while we're there
Aug 31 10:37:09 <mbenitez>	scela, thank you
Aug 31 10:38:47 <rgrunber>	fwiw the 1-888 dial-in code works so i expect the european one to as well.
Aug 31 10:38:53 <rgrunber>	(off my cell)
Aug 31 10:41:15 <mbooth>	Huh, I was wondering why my phone was displaying a danger sign...
Aug 31 10:41:46 <akurtakov>	wait am I late for the call?
Aug 31 10:41:52 <akurtakov>	it should bne in 20 mins, right?
Aug 31 10:42:03 <scela>	akurtakov: yep
Aug 31 10:42:12 <akurtakov>	ok
Aug 31 10:42:12 <scela>	that's exactly why i brought it up now :)
Aug 31 10:42:23 <rgrunber>	mbooth: oh crap.. you use the actual polycom ones..
Aug 31 10:42:40 <rgrunber>	ie.. on the network or something..
Aug 31 10:42:49 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I will have to slum it and use the laptop mic
Aug 31 10:42:51 <scela>	rgrunber: that's voip no?
Aug 31 10:43:13 <rgrunber>	mbooth: do you have some toll-free dial-in for bjn in your area ?
Aug 31 10:43:39 <mbenitez>	I should have the info around
Aug 31 10:44:13 <mbenitez>	you can try 08006948057 (UK)
Aug 31 10:44:42 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Maybe, but in the hierarchy of call quality, PSTN is right at the bottom
Aug 31 10:46:53 <mbenitez>	https://bluejeans.com/numbers
Aug 31 10:56:22 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: did you get my note regarding RC2 being built..docker stuff is at http://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools/update-neon-1-docker-rc2
Aug 31 10:56:35 <nboldt>	yes, jjohnstn. Will start the mirror shortly
Aug 31 10:56:38 <nboldt>	thanks!

Sep 01 08:49:05 <mbenitez>	mbooth, thank you for looking at the openshift account, I'll fwd your note to Carl, he may be able to help us get the account we need
Sep 01 10:26:37 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: who would I bug / where would I report the problem that webtools-javaee droplet has an old version of javax.servlet?
Sep 01 10:27:16 <rgrunber>	in rh-eclipse46 ?.. a rebuild might solve it.. /me looks
Sep 01 10:27:45 <nboldt1>	similarly, need to know who to bug / where to report problem where linuxtools-docker droplet has javax.ws.rs.api 2.0.99 but devstudio has javax.ws.rs 2.0.1
Sep 01 10:28:26 <nboldt1>	for the moment I'm removing bundles that conflict due to singleton (ie., two plugins that expose the same packages, but are singletons)
Sep 01 10:28:56 <nboldt1>	but thought maybe this should be solved in upstream from rh-eclipse46-devstudio (eg., in eclipse-* or rh-eclipse46-* packages)
Sep 01 10:30:28 <rgrunber>	/opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/eclipse/droplets/linuxtools-docker/eclipse/plugins/javax.ws.rs-api_2.0.99.b01.jar -> /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/java/glassfish-jax-rs-api.jar , which is from rh-eclipse46-glassfish-jax-rs-api-2.0.1-3.1.el7.noarch
Sep 01 10:31:11 <rgrunber>	Bundle-Version: 2.0.99.b01 but it's versioned as 2.0.1 .. i seem to remember this issue.
Sep 01 10:32:56 <rgrunber>	my guess is the content is likely the same.. just a matter of who decided to version it as 2.0.99.. i know in Orbit it's 2.0.1.
Sep 01 10:45:29 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: and yeah webtools-javaee is still using tomcat-servlet's 3.0 api
Sep 01 10:45:47 <rgrunber>	hmm i wonder if it's the same in fedora and upstream..
Sep 01 10:49:27 <rgrunber>	hmm in fedora we use glassfish-servlet-api (3.1) and in rh-eclipse46 its tomcat's.. might be a packaging bug on our end.
Sep 01 10:49:31 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: ^
Sep 01 10:50:40 <rgrunber>	yeah http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/rpms/eclipse-webtools/tree/eclipse-webtools.spec?h=rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7#n401 indicates we intend to use glassfish.. weird.. i'll look some more.
Sep 01 10:58:56 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: well here's why it's familiar : https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1227529
Sep 01 11:56:39 <xcoulon>	@rgrunber @jjohnstn hello ! I'm having test failures on the Gcov component of Linux Tools while verifying a patch for Docker tooling on hudson: https://hudson.eclipse.org/linuxtools/job/linuxtools-gerrit/11167/ (This is the 3rd time in a row that the build fails for the same reason). Any idea what I need to do to fix that or who I should ping ? 
Sep 01 11:57:38 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I am seeing the same error...no idea why it is cropping up now...will have to look into it...I am doing a retrigger and hoping it is a random error
Sep 01 11:58:43 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: well, I was also thinking about a random error but since I got it 3 times in a row, I stopped hoping
Sep 01 12:00:17 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: there haven't been any gcov changes since I did the RC2 build so I don't know why it is occurring...perhaps something has changed in the platform
Sep 01 12:02:10 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: argh. So we need to ask the developer(s) in charge of gcov to verify and update the tests against RC2, then
Sep 01 12:02:49 <akurtakov>	nboldt1: mbooth + bug against eclipse scl so we can get all the acks
Sep 01 12:03:22 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I don't think so...I also had a run last night against master and it succeeded...I don't think it is gcov...I think it is the Hudson environment some how or a timing issue
Sep 01 12:04:30 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ha ok
Sep 01 12:04:43 <akurtakov>	jjohnstn: xcoulon: note that yesterday hudson builder(at least one of them) was updated from sles 11 to sles 12
Sep 01 12:05:02 <xcoulon>	akurtakov: "sles" ?
Sep 01 12:05:22 <akurtakov>	SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
Sep 01 12:06:10 <akurtakov>	so it's a major change of the whole hudson environment when looked from gcc POV
Sep 01 12:12:35 <akurtakov>	jjohnstn:  my guess would be either some tweaks to the tests needed or some package missing on that builder now
Sep 01 12:13:27 <ericwill>	akurtakov which version of GTK is that for SLES 12? 3.10?
Sep 01 12:27:01 <xcoulon>	akurtakov: ha ok, I see. Indeed, that may be the reason for the test failures. (sorry for the delayed response, I was on a call)
Sep 01 12:34:13 <jjohnstn>	ericwill: is there some form of work-around we can do?
Sep 01 13:23:13 <ericwill>	jjohnstn workaround for?
Sep 01 13:23:24 <ericwill>	Gcov failures?
Sep 01 13:35:31 <jjohnstn>	ericwill: for any bugs introduced by 3.10 or is just that the test-case is flawed and 3.10 exhibits them
Sep 01 13:38:17 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: having an issue with loading e4.6 target...I get stalled at 25% (over 30 minutes so far) and the following console msg:
Sep 01 13:38:36 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: Artifact repository out of sync. Overwriting /home/jjohnstn/workspace-neon-devel/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/.bundle_pool/plugins/org.bouncycastle.bcprov-jdk15on_1.52.0.v20160323-2125.jar
Sep 01 13:45:59 <ericwill>	jjohnstn I was asking out of curiosity, I doubt the problems are related to GTK
Sep 01 14:02:41 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: there's a newer version of bcprov in a newer I-build for linuxtools.
Sep 01 14:03:30 <rgrunber>	the target platform pde stuff has always been a little buggy.. i would try re-generating it.
Sep 01 14:06:36 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i like your thinking :P and have nothing against the balance of members being in Europe :P
Sep 01 14:53:48 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I can't get it to regenerate...any suggestions?  It stalls computing prerequisite plan
Sep 01 14:54:52 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: can you try bumping the sequence number in the target file ? then try the same thing (i usually try reloading, or i unselect the target platform, and then reslect it)
Sep 01 14:55:32 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: ok, I have already tried reloading and unselecting the target platform
Sep 01 14:58:54 <nboldt>	rgrunber: so looking at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1227529 I see why we have the disconnect in versions but ... well, I guess I still need to remove/blacklist some plugins that are already installed
Sep 01 15:37:16 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: could not get it working so had to switch to new workspace
Sep 01 15:39:13 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: that should work for usre. though i'm pretty sure bumping the target platform sequence number in the file shuld also work.
Sep 01 15:39:37 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: it did not for me
Sep 02 09:01:32 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: will join the call in 1min
Sep 02 09:01:36 <rgrunber>	k
Sep 02 10:25:38 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I posted a sample patch at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/80308/1 as per instructions in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2276271/how-to-make-mock-to-void-methods-with-mockito
Sep 02 10:28:45 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok, let me try it now, then
Sep 02 10:29:09 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: thx
Sep 02 10:34:15 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: so you want to change the status in the MockContainerStatus when the container is restarted, right ?
Sep 02 10:45:59 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: so the tests will pass if you use this: 
Sep 02 10:45:59 <xcoulon>	.when(this.dockerClient).restartContainer(Matchers.anyString(), Matchers.anyInt());
Sep 02 10:46:49 <xcoulon>	unfortunately, Mockito does not accept the Matchers.eq() methods as args in the 'restartContainer()' method call.
Sep 02 10:55:31 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: ok, thx
Sep 02 11:19:49 <ipun>	is anyone haviong trouble with hudson building slow right now? My build started 25 minutes ago and its still not done
Sep 02 11:23:26 <jjohnstn>	ipun: not running gerrit right now, but take a look at the console log...if it doesn't move after a significant period of time, the job may be stalled and you will have to retrigger/rebuild...otherwise, just wait
Sep 02 11:24:43 <ipun>	jjohnstn it looks like it just finished, mustve been something bogging it down
Sep 02 11:25:50 <jjohnstn>	ipun: could be Hudson is being taxed today...there is a platform build due today
Sep 02 11:29:26 <ipun>	gotcha, thanks for letting me know

Sep 02 12:30:34 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn|afk: all my 3 patches built successfully on Gerrit/Hudson. You should have received notifications for the review, if you have time for that before RC3
Sep 02 15:44:19 <jjohnstn|afk>	rgrunber: I'm getting an abort error running oprofile with epp-cpp RC2...opreport process error output: warning: /no-vmlinux could not be found.
Sep 02 15:44:35 <jjohnstn|afk>	rgrunber: is this just AERI being overly sensitive to the word error as it is only a warning?
Sep 02 15:46:06 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn|afk: i think so.. i'm guessing it's logged in the error log and aeri picks it up.

Sep 06 03:21:10 <mistria>	scela: ah yeah, I didn't look carefully
Sep 06 03:21:29 <mistria>	scela: I just parsed the file names and didn't even look at the manifest...
Sep 06 03:21:36 <mistria>	scela: feel free to bash me on the bug :)
Sep 06 03:22:05 <scela>	mistria: no, I'll save the credit for when I make some similar thing :)
Sep 06 03:22:39 <mistria>	scela: hope I'll remember about it!
Sep 06 03:22:40 <scela>	mistria: i figured it's too much trouble ATM to get rid of it for the profit

Sep 06 03:23:17 <mistria>	scela: Activators are cool and useful
Sep 06 03:24:31 <scela>	mistria: your ECA has expired it seems, or you probably had the issue I had a week ago or so (when I asked you to push the example thing as I couldn't)
Sep 06 03:24:53 <mistria>	scela: yeah, I've added a note to the bug

Sep 06 08:36:10 <scela>	mbooth: remember our friend lucene the fast-releaser? I set up everything working fine with lucene 6.1. Now 6.2 asks for backward-codecs to read the 6.1 index
Sep 06 08:36:23 <mbooth>	Hah
Sep 06 08:36:24 <scela>	and causes 11 test failuers
Sep 06 08:36:33 <mbooth>	scela: Lucene is comedy gold :-)
Sep 06 08:38:27 <scela>	mbooth: i really can't imagine how people keep up with them

Sep 06 08:40:12 *	scela shakes fist at monitor
Sep 06 08:40:49 <mbooth>	scela: I think the short answer is: They don't keep up, probably just pick a version from Maven central and then leave it alone....

Sep 06 12:18:43 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff. I have 2 pending patches for review on Gerrit. Would you have time to review them before tonight's RC3 build ?
Sep 06 12:19:04 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I should be able to
Sep 06 12:19:44 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: great ! I have to go for errands but I'll be available later if you have any question or issue with the patches
Sep 06 12:19:56 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: ok
Sep 06 14:42:24 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: a colleague reported https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500933 earlier today while testing the OpenShift tooling. Basically, he had some images with a name but no tag in his Docker connection and they would not appear in the Docker tooling (but they do appear in the output of 'docker images'). We'll work further on this issue tomorrow, because for now I'm unable to reproduce the problem. I wonder if this could be included in 
Sep 06 14:42:28 <xcoulon>	wdyt ?
Sep 06 14:43:29 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: unless you have some images with no tag (ie, "<none>") on your machine ?
Sep 06 14:43:55 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: yes, we can make a last minute bug fix to RC4 if necessary
Sep 06 14:45:15 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: great ! I hope this will be a simple fix. Apparently, the images would appear if the filters are desactivated, so I assume it's a matter of setting the 'dangling' and 'intermediate' flags properly on this edge case. But so far, I could not see what's wrong in the code, so I need to investigate a little more with Marian tomorrow
Sep 06 14:45:23 <xcoulon>	I'll keep you updated
Sep 06 14:45:29 <jjohnstn>	ok
Sep 06 15:42:06 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff. Did you need my help for the remaining tasks for RC3 or are you good ?
Sep 06 15:42:15 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon
Sep 06 15:42:23 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: I'm fine
Sep 06 15:42:30 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: thx
Sep 06 15:42:38 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: great ! in that case, I'll just shutdown the laptop ;-)
Sep 06 15:42:41 <xcoulon>	thanks
Sep 06 15:42:55 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: bye
Sep 06 15:42:57 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: have a good evening
Sep 06 15:43:10 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: thanks ! samewise !
Sep 07 04:12:17 <xcoulon>	mistria: hello Mickael. I need your help on JBoss Tools: I have this error when I run an 'mvn clean verify' on JBoss Tools OpenShift repo: http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/409417
Sep 07 07:43:50 <akurtakov>	https://akurtakov.fedorapeople.org/buttoncss.webm :)
Sep 07 09:32:48 <ipun>	akurtakov, what tool do you use to make webms of your desktop for demonstrations?

Sep 07 12:08:48 <rgrunber>	mbooth: reproduced on f24 ?
Sep 07 12:09:10 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Yes
Sep 07 12:10:23 <akurtakov>	ipun: thanks
Sep 07 12:13:33 <rgrunber>	mbooth: also.. http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/409678
Sep 07 12:14:41 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Ah, that must be the convo I remember...
Sep 07 12:15:11 <rgrunber>	that was for fedora though.
Sep 07 12:16:04 <rgrunber>	i think what we concluded was that if cdt-parsers depends on cdt-core then it's ok.. because the symlink will resolve.. but you say that cdt-parsers can exist without core ?
Sep 07 12:18:09 <mbooth>	rgrunber: No, the opposite -- cdt without cdt-parsers -- the symlink will be installed by cdt but the req is from cdt-parsers
Sep 07 12:18:25 <rgrunber>	ahh..
Sep 07 12:19:03 <rgrunber>	hmm but if only cdt-parsers needs it.. it's technically just a packaging standards bug.
Sep 07 12:22:17 <mbooth>	Yeah, I guess it *should* be the case that the only breakage is a broken symlink...
Sep 07 12:24:07 <rgrunber>	still probably worth investigating..
Sep 07 12:31:07 <rgrunber>	mbooth: consider the docker bug taken off your hands :P
Sep 08 05:42:32 <scela>	mistria: i've actually no idea about what icon would make sense
Sep 08 05:42:40 <scela>	would be nice if there's one ready-made
Sep 08 05:43:11 <scela>	akurtakov: do you know of an icon that would fit our generic editor?
Sep 08 05:44:12 <akurtakov>	scela: hmm, where do you want to use it ?
Sep 08 05:44:49 <akurtakov>	I always connected icons in explorer with file type not with editor to use for it
Sep 08 05:44:58 <akurtakov>	or I'm misunderstanding the question
Sep 08 05:45:56 <scela>	akurtakov: i suppose it will be common and linked with the editor, rather than content type
Sep 08 05:46:25 <akurtakov>	in the package explorer?
Sep 08 05:46:38 <scela>	in the editor tab
Sep 08 05:47:17 <akurtakov>	ah now I get it :)
Sep 08 05:55:57 <scela>	akurtakov: fyi, about putting it in M2 dani says he's more worried about breaking releng stuff so late, rather than our stuff being broken
Sep 08 05:56:15 <scela>	akurtakov: by releng stuff he means https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497871#c11
Sep 08 05:56:15 <akurtakov>	hmm
Sep 08 05:57:11 <akurtakov>	hmm, I hate the way tests are run now
Sep 08 05:57:19 <akurtakov>	I can see his point
Sep 08 06:01:16 <akurtakov>	commented on the bug
Sep 08 06:01:53 <akurtakov>	although getting the code in even if tests not run or not in a feature shouldn't be an issue and will actualy only minimize the risk
Sep 08 06:28:21 <mistria>	akurtakov: instead of some complex XML, the test could be a single huge test bundle referencing all Test Suites
Sep 08 09:33:05 <scela>	mistria: I'm already trying to come up with the icon
Sep 08 09:33:20 <scela>	did you spend much effort on it or shall I go on?
Sep 08 09:33:40 <mistria>	scela: go ahead
Sep 08 09:33:57 <mistria>	scela: I spent some efforts thinking about it, but it was fruitless, I didn't start anything
Sep 08 09:34:38 <scela>	mistria: i asked lars about some details as he has quite some experience with this
Sep 08 09:34:46 <scela>	in the sense of multiple resolutions etc.
Sep 08 09:34:54 <scela>	but I can do the 'drawing'
Sep 08 09:40:47 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: on now call about what dev program leads discussed in Westford a few weeks ago / upcoming work
Sep 08 09:40:54 <mbenitez>	https://redhat.bluejeans.com/3801535957/
Sep 08 10:29:51 <rgrunber>	mbooth: the bug you pointed me to should be resolved.. the other (regarding unix sockets) is a bit more concerning now.
Sep 08 10:30:19 <rgrunber>	*by resolved i mean i'll push a solution soon..
Sep 08 12:16:15 <scela>	mistria: https://imgur.com/a/AL1Fo
Sep 08 12:16:34 <mistria>	scela: good enough for the moment
Sep 08 12:16:47 <scela>	yeah I think it's ugly but not enough ugly to be a blocker now
Sep 08 12:17:08 <scela>	i think I'll go with this one
Sep 08 12:17:13 <scela>	probably tonight I'll push it

Sep 09 11:51:46 <rgrunber>	mbooth: ping (re: eclipse branches on fedora)
Sep 09 11:56:46 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Hey
Sep 09 11:57:13 <rgrunber>	mbooth: for eclipse-linuxtools, any plans to update f24 to 5.1.0, or any of that stack ?
Sep 09 11:57:21 <rgrunber>	likely.. not ?
Sep 09 12:00:40 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Erm, since F24 has Neon, it probably makes sense to update to the neon point releases
Sep 09 12:00:45 <mbooth>	Once released
Sep 09 12:01:35 <rgrunber>	was asking because f24 branch is on the commit before 5.1.0 but i've added a docker tooling fix that applies to all so .. was curious if i should cherry pick or fast-forward.
Sep 09 12:31:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I found q fix for Bug 500969: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/80831/ the problem was that the 'passwords' collection was the same reference as the registry accounts, so the same registry account was added twice: once upon dialog completion and then once when all modifications where processed, when the preference page was closed. 
Sep 09 12:32:33 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I have to go now, but we can further discuss about the patch on Monday if you want to.
Sep 09 12:37:08 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: k sounds fine.
Sep 09 13:02:59 <rgrunber>	mbooth: sorry about not addressing some of those rhbz rhscl ones sooner.. i must have only been following things where the component was rh-eclipse46.
Sep 09 13:03:19 <mbooth>	rgrunber: No worries, thanks for taking a look :-)
Sep 09 13:03:27 <rgrunber>	and https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1368140 is kinda subtle... very stuble..
Sep 09 13:10:27 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: ping
Sep 09 13:21:12 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: nvm

Sep 12 12:48:19 <mloriedo1>	mbenitez: thanks ;-)
Sep 12 14:29:27 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i think i've found the issue in the cdt rhscl build. it does appear to be a cycle.. i have lpgjava symlink being created in cdt-parsers once i applied a fix (instead of current behaviour of core).. just wanna look at an rpmdiff to confirm nothing else is changing.
Sep 13 10:12:32 <rgrunber>	mbooth: any idea what's happening here ? http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=15615501
Sep 13 10:13:01 <rgrunber>	'Error: nothing provides osgi(org.eclipse.jdt.core) = 3.12.0.v20160903.1000 needed by eclipse-contributor-tools-1:4.6.0-7.fc26.aarch64.'
Sep 13 10:13:24 <mbooth>	Aye, rebootstrapping is occurring
Sep 13 10:13:34 <rgrunber>	yarr.. for yet another arch
Sep 13 10:19:27 <rgrunber>	mbooth: slight good news.. your dead symlinks in cdt-land should get resolved.

Sep 13 10:20:02 <rgrunber>	and now i'm thinking of making fp-p2 log a warning when there is a cycle.. because it can actually detect that..
Sep 13 10:20:31 <mbooth>	Might be a good idea :-)
Sep 13 10:43:08 <akurtakov_>	rgrunber: definetely go for it 
Sep 13 10:43:19 <akurtakov_>	we might consider even breaking the build if possible
Sep 13 10:44:35 <rgrunber>	akurtakov_: i thought about failing immediately.. but we probably want the option to "just build it" and if it's small enough of an issue.. fix it afterwards..
Sep 13 10:45:14 <akurtakov_>	ok, let it be a warning for now
Sep 13 10:45:35 <akurtakov_>	but if more similar issues appear we should bump it to break the build 
Sep 13 10:45:57 <rgrunber>	yeah, as for upstream.. i'll have to see if there's any reason for that to exist : http://git.eclipse.org/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt.git/tree/cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote-feature/feature.xml when source-feature should handle source bundles.

Sep 14 11:59:50 <nboldt>	it can wait. Just clarifying if the test is MEANINGFUL, given comments from Chris and the fact that to date, it's never caught a problem :D
Sep 14 11:59:53 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, wait - are we going live with the bits before the 21st?
Sep 14 11:59:53 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_: ^
Sep 14 12:00:00 <nboldt>	yes. that's the plan
Sep 14 12:00:22 <nboldt>	bits are needed to be live so that the devsuite online installer can be BUILT and then TESTED
Sep 14 12:00:42 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, the bits will be live - but we won't tell anyone until the 21st?
Sep 14 12:00:43 <nboldt>	it requires that openjdk, cdt, rhel, vagrant stuff, and devstudio all be LIVE in production download manager
Sep 14 12:00:57 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_: yes, just like in June. Release this week, announce next week
Sep 14 12:01:52 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, that's what I thought the plan was - if we can wait, I'd like to wait as I am buried and their test is running - and maybe change the test after it completes 
Sep 14 12:02:36 <nboldt>	You're delaying Denis' ability to build something. if he can't build it, he can't have it tested
Sep 14 12:03:13 <nboldt>	so... could mean that devsuite is pushed to prod on Monday (because generally siege won't push new stuff out on a Friday to avoid a "commit'n'run" problem over the weekend
Sep 14 12:07:51 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, OK - let me check the checksums - now
Sep 14 12:16:43 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_: I did that already :) see https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/RCM-6841
Sep 14 12:19:46 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, I just verified that you performed a redundant task - or maybe I did - OK to go live!

Probably for SSL connections to docker instances, I would guess. It seems unlikely that anyone is using these algorithms in SSL certificates so I'm happy to just remove them
Sep 14 12:20:27 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Is there a bug, or shall I file one?
Sep 14 12:20:34 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yeah iirc we mainly use PEMParser, PEMReader.. or something along those lines..
Sep 14 12:20:43 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, can I not go back to banging my head against a different wall?   ;-)
Sep 14 12:21:02 <mbenitez>	mbooth, good to hear, let's file a bug and go ahead with the removal you propose
Sep 14 12:21:10 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Yep, PEMParser and PEMKeyPair
Sep 14 12:21:11 <mbenitez>	thanks for looking at this so quickly!
Sep 14 12:21:13 <nboldt>	ldimaggi_: if you sign off in the RCM ticket, then yes
Sep 14 12:21:29 <ldimaggi_>	nboldt, just did - lata....
Sep 14 12:23:12 <ldimaggi_>	thx!
Sep 14 12:33:01 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, is it ok if I dev_ack this 1374634 ? says fix is in 5.1.0
Sep 14 12:33:47 <rgrunber>	yeah it should get pulled back into the rpm once we update.
Sep 14 12:34:40 <mbenitez>	great, thanks
Sep 14 14:55:13 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: for https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1374214 , should i be adding a 'Doc Type' of 'Known Issue' ?
Sep 14 14:56:07 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, yes, that makes sense
Sep 15 05:28:35 <akurtakov>	mistria: thanks for bringing the case for CWidgets
Sep 15 05:28:44 <akurtakov>	needles to say that I hate them :)
Sep 15 05:42:16 <mistria>	akurtakov: :)
Sep 15 09:03:22 <jkang>	lufimtse, ooc, do you still use trello?
Sep 15 09:06:41 <akurtakov>	mbooth: can you point me to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1367019 upstream clone ?
Sep 15 10:49:39 <nboldt>	akurtakov: rgrunber: what's the easiest way to inject a timestamp into the generated artifact filename when producing an rpm? 
Sep 15 10:50:02 <nboldt>	I could just rename stuff w/ shell script but was wondering if there was something I could do in the spec file
Sep 15 10:51:20 <nboldt>	eg., a self-contained way rather than a bolted-on way
Sep 15 10:51:50 <akurtakov>	by generated artifact you mean as in qualifier for bundles?
Sep 15 10:51:52 <rgrunber>	nboldt: this is for an osgi bundle, built by tycho ?
Sep 15 10:53:02 <rgrunber>	i'm guessing not because default for 'eclipse-plugin' is to have a build-qualifier set.
Sep 15 10:54:48 <rgrunber>	i guess to force your own you could try '-DforceContextQualifier=...'
Sep 15 10:55:19 <rgrunber>	ie.. what we do in eclipse spec..
Sep 15 10:55:53 <nboldt>	no, I mean when producing rh-eclipse46-devstudio-1.0-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
Sep 15 10:56:12 <nboldt>	would like each one to have a unique timestamp in the filename so they're easier to differentiate & know when it was built
Sep 15 10:56:41 <mbooth>	nboldt: Add something to the Release: tag is probably best
Sep 15 10:56:42 <nboldt>	instead of 1.0-1, want something like 1.0-1-20160915-1100
Sep 15 10:57:42 <nboldt>	ok, and how do I declare a variable in a spec file? (I could google this I guess...)
Sep 15 10:58:46 <nboldt>	can i pass things in to rpmbuild --define "something something" ?
Sep 15 10:59:10 <mbooth>	So at the top of the spec file you could put something like:
Sep 15 10:59:17 <rgrunber>	%global foo $(date ...)
Sep 15 10:59:17 <mbooth>	%{expand: %%global stamp %(date -u +%Y$m%d-%H%M)}
Sep 15 10:59:45 <mbooth>	Then in the Release: tag you can put %{stamp}
Sep 15 10:59:45 <nboldt>	and then ref it as %{stamp} ?
Sep 15 10:59:48 <nboldt>	nice
Sep 15 10:59:49 <mbooth>	Yeah
Sep 15 11:00:14 *	nboldt cheers for bash-like embedding
Sep 15 11:00:43 <mbooth>	Yeah, RPM has pretty ugly macro "language"
Sep 15 11:01:01 <nboldt>	meh, this works
Sep 15 11:06:11 <akurtakov>	nboldt: mbooth: you can always go for lua if you like it more 
Sep 15 11:06:14 *	akurtakov hides :)
Sep 15 11:09:12 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Lua Lua / oh no / it's gotta go ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PVoVRUrxVY
Sep 15 11:10:26 <akurtakov>	mbooth: btw, nice on putting neon.1 platform

Sep 15 16:04:47 <mbenitez>	jjohnstn|wfh, gold star for compass :) thanks
Sep 15 16:39:40 <jjohnstn|wfh>	mbenitez: np
Sep 16 07:43:39 <akurtakov>	mistria: reading ide-dev?
Sep 16 07:43:58 <akurtakov>	I can't make my mind do I care for dark theme or I'm totally ignorant :P
Sep 16 08:35:44 <mistria>	akurtakov: yeah, I'm following
Sep 16 08:36:03 <mistria>	akurtakov: It's a part of the debate I'm better out
Sep 16 08:36:15 <mistria>	akurtakov: I hate dark themes so much I prefer remaining silent
Sep 16 08:36:43 <akurtakov>	mistria: sure, I don't use them myself but they proved to be really good testcase for swt bugs :)
Sep 16 08:37:32 <mistria>	akurtakov: that's indeed a benefit we can find them
Sep 16 08:37:54 <mistria>	akurtakov: we have some UI bits in JBoss Tools which look very bad in dark theme
Sep 16 08:38:25 <mistria>	akurtakov: but it's some old Eclipse code that was copied... so I believe the UI itself is to blame more than the theme or the theming engine
Sep 16 08:39:04 <akurtakov>	someone once told me Ctrl+C/Ctrl+P should be forbidden in IDEs :)
Sep 16 08:39:40 <mistria>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-20045
Sep 16 08:42:43 <akurtakov>	mistria: ah, this is windows?
Sep 16 08:42:54 <mistria>	akurtakov: don't know
Sep 16 08:43:20 <akurtakov>	I came to that conclusion based on the scrollbar on one of the screenshots and button on the other
Sep 16 08:43:30 <mistria>	akurtakov: I think Fred uses Windows, but feel free to ask on the bug
Sep 16 08:47:07 <mistria>	akurtakov: one day, suddenly, Apple or Google or whatever company people trust blindly will make a statement that dark themes are bad
Sep 16 08:47:17 <akurtakov>	haha :)
Sep 16 08:47:26 <mistria>	akurtakov: and suddenly, all people will believe it and stop with their dark themes
Sep 16 08:47:49 <akurtakov>	one day MS will adopt gtk or qt as the way of doing UI :) 
Sep 16 08:48:43 <mistria>	akurtakov: well, with VSCode multi-platform, C# on Linux, SQL Server on Linux... I believe they're already adopting Linux as the developer environment.
Sep 16 08:49:04 <akurtakov>	yeah, final step is to give up on win32 :)
Sep 16 08:49:11 <akurtakov>	MFC :)
Sep 16 08:50:39 <akurtakov>	I'm eager to try running swt/gtk on windows
Sep 16 08:50:55 <akurtakov>	but first I must get rid of gtk2 support to be able to drop the X11 deps
Sep 16 08:51:05 <akurtakov>	but it's days are numbered :)

Sep 16 09:46:08 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: ping (re. stack overflow)
Sep 16 14:30:06 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: what's up ?
Sep 16 14:31:07 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: i tried reproducing in a mock environment.. but it succeeds.. diffing against the logs up until where you see the failure shows they're identical.. but no error for me.
Sep 16 14:31:38 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: ah, ok probaly it's my environment having some plugin installed causing it
Sep 16 14:31:42 <akurtakov>	never mind in this case
Sep 16 14:31:51 <rgrunber>	i *may* need your .m2 folder (or possible just .m2/p2/ and the metadata.. in case something fishy is happening with that.
Sep 16 14:32:38 <rgrunber>	also i had to patch eclipse-packagekit to pull from neon (it's not in master)
Sep 16 14:35:10 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: never mind as long as mock works it's fine :)
Sep 16 14:35:24 <akurtakov>	I don't have the powre to investigate it more :)
Sep 16 14:36:12 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: maybe back up your .m2 folder if you have time.. i'm fairly sure i know where the error is happening.. but without some more info it's hard to say why it happens.
Sep 16 14:36:22 <rgrunber>	:P.. it is intersting
Sep 16 14:36:47 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: it's 4 GB :)
Sep 16 14:36:56 <akurtakov>	I guess it's time ot delete it :)
Sep 16 14:37:01 <rgrunber>	haha
Sep 16 14:38:24 <rgrunber>	how big is your .m2/p2, .m2/.cache, .m2/.meta ? any better.. pretty sure it'd just be those needed.
Sep 16 14:48:25 <akurtakov>	p2 is 883
Sep 16 14:48:29 <akurtakov>	MB
Sep 16 14:48:38 <rgrunber>	yikes.. bah
Sep 16 14:48:57 <akurtakov>	:)
Sep 16 14:49:08 <akurtakov>	you see, too much bload
Sep 16 14:49:11 <rgrunber>	hmm maybe try just .m2/cache and .m2/.meta .. it's worth a shot in case i can actually reproduce off cached metadata..
Sep 16 14:49:18 <akurtakov>	le me remove it
Sep 16 14:49:27 <akurtakov>	cached is 21mb
Sep 16 14:49:58 <akurtakov>	meta is 112k single file
Sep 16 14:50:13 <rgrunber>	that sounds fine to me.
Sep 16 14:51:17 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: btw, have you looked at dbus-java ?
Sep 16 14:51:28 <akurtakov>	can we get it in orbit?
Sep 16 14:51:48 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: it's approved.. so i presume yes.
Sep 16 14:52:10 <akurtakov>	would we need to file packagekit cq first for linuxtools ?
Sep 16 14:53:05 <akurtakov>	anyway, it would be nice to see whether we can bulid eclipse-packagekit against it
Sep 16 14:53:18 <akurtakov>	if we can, I would start the contribution process for linuxtools
Sep 16 14:56:05 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: so the issue is with libmatthew-java
Sep 16 14:56:27 <akurtakov>	do we have dbus-java without libmatthew-java ?
Sep 16 14:57:37 <akurtakov>	I think I managed to get that CQ finished
Sep 16 14:58:40 <akurtakov>	https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4828
Sep 16 14:59:55 <rgrunber>	k so we have everything then. sorry a bit confused..
Sep 16 15:00:12 <rgrunber>	i though the issue was libmatthew but it's that dbus-java was initally Academic License or something.
Sep 16 15:00:50 <rgrunber>	but it was re-licensed https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=8063
Sep 16 15:02:55 <akurtakov>	yeah, long story 
Sep 16 15:04:22 <akurtakov>	I just lost patience with this one somewhere
Sep 16 15:04:54 <rgrunber>	so do you want to push eclipse-packagekit into eclipse foundation?
Sep 16 15:05:13 <rgrunber>	or just not have to build in a hacky way with only xmvn.
Sep 16 15:05:28 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: I want to push it to linuxtools
Sep 16 15:05:38 <akurtakov>	so it can be used in rpm tooling
Sep 16 15:05:42 <akurtakov>	and probably others
Sep 16 15:06:15 <akurtakov>	but proving it can be built with the jars from cqs
Sep 16 15:06:23 <akurtakov>	is a prereq for even trying :)
Sep 16 15:07:00 <akurtakov>	if you can investigate it and let me know next week, I would be reall thankful
Sep 16 15:07:05 <rgrunber>	yeah.. well from what i see only thing missing is ato-cqs and getting it in.. so it should be possible.
Sep 16 15:11:53 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: so please create rough orbit bundles and try packagekit build against them
Sep 16 15:11:58 <akurtakov>	if it works we proceed
Sep 16 15:12:14 <akurtakov>	time to go to bed
Sep 16 15:12:17 <akurtakov>	tty next week

Sep 19 09:56:14 <nboldt>	hey, any mock experts about? mbooth ? wondering if I can easily run two mock-based builds of rh-eclipse46-devstudio rpm in parallel without them accidentally using the same mock locations
Sep 19 09:57:21 <nboldt>	do I just use a different config_opts['basedir'] = '/var/lib/mock'
Sep 19 09:57:21 <nboldt>	for each run?
Sep 19 09:57:38 <nboldt>	or config_opts['macros']['%_topdir'] = '/builddir/build' ?
Sep 19 09:57:56 <nboldt>	do the config_opts['root'] = '${mock_cfg}' values need to be unique too?
Sep 19 09:59:08 <nboldt>	mbooth: looking in https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/build.sh#L270 for how to config so each version of the build (devstudio 10.1, 10.2) can safely run w/o crashing into each other
Sep 19 09:59:38 <jerboaa>	nboldt, you could create a dupe mock config with config_opts['root'] changed, perhaps?
Sep 19 09:59:54 <mbooth>	nboldt: Hey, using two mock roots simultaneously is normally fine -- you could probably just change the value of this var: https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/build.sh#L272
Sep 19 10:04:55 <nboldt>	mbooth: so it's only the 'root' that matters?
Sep 19 10:06:09 <nboldt>	they can share the same /builddir/build folder and use /var/lib/mock for both too? 
Sep 19 10:06:35 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yeah, they are basically chroot jails underneath, so each 'root' is isolated from one another
Sep 19 10:07:58 <nboldt>	sweet, thanks
Sep 19 10:07:58 <jerboaa>	don't think they share /builddir/build. AFAIK that's within /var/lib/mock/<root>/root/
Sep 19 10:08:36 <rgrunber>	they would share /var/cache/mock/$cfg ..
Sep 19 10:08:41 <nboldt>	thx, jerboaa, mbooth. will try it. results TBD in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4051
Sep 19 10:09:06 <rgrunber>	ahh.. multiple mock builds off same config?
Sep 19 10:09:17 <nboldt>	well, SIMILAR config. 
Sep 19 10:09:37 <nboldt>	two parallel builds using more or less the same config, but fetching p2 repo sources from different update sites
Sep 19 10:09:53 <nboldt>	one for devstudio 10.1 (stable build) and one for devstudio 10.2 (CI build)
Sep 19 10:10:03 <nboldt>	because, continuous delivery & stuff
Sep 19 10:10:41 <nboldt>	does the value of 'root' ever appear in the resulting RPM? could I use 'foo' and 'bar' ?
Sep 19 10:11:02 <nboldt>	or should I use something like rh-eclipse46-10.1 and rh-eclipse46-10.2 ?
Sep 19 10:11:04 <jerboaa>	its the folder in /var/lib/mock
Sep 19 10:11:37 <nboldt>	so it's irrelephant to installation of the rpm once it's built? never seen by an end user?
Sep 19 10:11:49 <nboldt>	(irrelephant = not relevant to elephants)
Sep 19 10:12:03 <nboldt>	:D
Sep 19 10:12:07 <jerboaa>	:) that's my understanding
Sep 19 10:12:11 <nboldt>	sweet, thx
Sep 19 10:12:28 <nboldt>	then I can just pass in the job name (which is unique within a Jenkins instance) and we'll be OK here
Sep 19 10:13:06 <jerboaa>	if disk space is of no concern ;-)
Sep 19 10:14:01 <jerboaa>	for an openjdk build that's ~4GB
Sep 19 10:14:31 <jerboaa>	(per mock root)
Sep 19 10:17:15 <nboldt>	jerboaa: yeah, I've got space on wonka
Sep 19 10:17:30 <nboldt>	... should I be purging mock roots when done?
Sep 19 10:17:35 <nboldt>	or do they clean themselves up?
Sep 19 10:19:44 <jerboaa>	not sure. It depend on how mock builds are triggered. there are a couple of options. e.g. --no-cleanup-after.
Sep 19 10:20:07 <jerboaa>	man page says: Don't clean chroot after building. If automatic cleanup is enabled, use this to disable.
Sep 19 10:20:40 <rgrunber>	well any new build son that chroot would clean before starting.. unless '--no-clean' is given.
Sep 19 10:20:45 <rgrunber>	builds on*
Sep 19 10:21:04 <jerboaa>	yes. same root. but if they don't get reused...
Sep 19 10:21:35 <jerboaa>	/var/lib/mock/jenkins-1 /var/lib/mock/jenkins-2 ...
Sep 19 10:21:51 <mbooth>	But they should get resused if nboldt is doing it per-job, not per-build...
Sep 19 10:22:16 <jerboaa>	right
Sep 19 10:22:55 *	jerboaa totally missed "per job name", sorry
Sep 19 10:23:01 <rgrunber>	yeah, i'm just thinking how much of a hit is going to be taken for a clean.. if that chroot needs to be set up once again.
Sep 19 10:23:50 <nboldt>	ah, seems my build.sh (which is derived from mbooth's original) uses mock --no-clean
Sep 19 10:24:24 <nboldt>	which makes subsequent rebuilds faster... but less "continuous integration/delivery" 
Sep 19 10:24:50 <nboldt>	so... I guess I should make that optional or remove it entirely? */me ponders*
Sep 19 10:25:56 <rgrunber>	seems like you want some kind of listener on the yum repos being used.. and only remove '--no-clean' if there's been changes..
Sep 19 10:26:32 <rgrunber>	might even be some yum plugin for this
Sep 19 10:31:52 <rgrunber>	or i guess you could just call mock -r .. --update 
Sep 19 10:32:30 <nboldt>	looks like the mock root for a devstudio rpm build is 3.2G
Sep 19 10:32:47 <nboldt>	so... definitely don't want to have to spool that up for EVERY ci build
Sep 19 10:33:37 <rgrunber>	so then --no-clean and maybe a --update prior to every build to make sure it's up to date.
Sep 19 11:35:00 <nboldt>	rgrunber: mbooth: hey, does rh-eclipse46-base.x86_64 need to require jdk 1.7?
Sep 19 11:35:25 <mbooth>	nboldt: No, you can assume jdk 8 is installed
Sep 19 11:35:26 <nboldt>	because I recently updated to java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel-1:1.8.0.102-1.b14.fc24.x86_64 in favour of java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel-1:1.7.0.91-2.6.2.3.el7.x86_64 and now I can't install rh-eclipse46-base.x86_64
Sep 19 11:35:52 <akurtakov>	we should req 1.8 IIRC
Sep 19 11:36:17 <nboldt>	http://pastebin.com/2CaVDU1Y
Sep 19 11:36:20 <nboldt>	akurtakov: ^
Sep 19 11:36:45 <akurtakov>	neon itself requires 1.8 so hard req 1.7 looks like plain bug to me
Sep 19 11:37:01 <akurtakov>	ah that's maven33
Sep 19 11:37:03 <mbooth>	nboldt: Hmm, mixing Fedora and RHEL RPMs?
Sep 19 11:37:24 <nboldt>	yeah. how else can I install-test the stuff I'm building?
Sep 19 11:37:36 <nboldt>	I don't have a RHEL7 license. CSP won't let me download it
Sep 19 11:37:56 *	akurtakov is leaving it to mbooth to handle now :)
Sep 19 11:38:07 <nboldt>	rh-eclipse46.repo with baseurl=http://download.devel.redhat.com/brewroot/repos/rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7-build/latest/x86_64 used to work until I installed jdk8
Sep 19 11:38:37 <nboldt>	so... seems like a bug in the rh-eclipse46-base package that it requires 1.7, not 1.7+
Sep 19 11:38:52 <mbooth>	nboldt: I use either a EL7 VM or install into a mock root
Sep 19 11:39:12 <mbooth>	nboldt: Installing el7 packages on fedora is not really supported
Sep 19 11:39:31 <nboldt>	hmm. can you explain how to do mock root install inside F24?
Sep 19 11:39:50 <nboldt>	or where I can get .iso for RHEL7 which won't tell me I need some entitlement?
Sep 19 11:39:56 <nboldt>	(Should I use centos vm?
Sep 19 11:40:40 <mbooth>	I thought all employees could get RHEL license, but CentOS will probably work
Sep 19 11:41:00 <mbooth>	To install an RPM directly into a mock root:
Sep 19 11:41:01 <mbooth>	mock -r ... --install /path/to/rpm
Sep 19 11:43:06 <mbooth>	nboldt: Thinking about it, I recall prodding mbenitez about getting RHEL entitlement, but the mists of time obscure what actually happened....
Sep 19 11:44:36 <mbooth>	But for the record, you can see we explicitly require java 1.8 here: http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/rpms/rh-eclipse46/tree/rh-eclipse46.spec?h=rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7#n118
Sep 19 11:48:39 <mbooth>	nboldt: BTW, what's the best way to propose blacklist additions? Github PR?
Sep 19 11:52:16 <nboldt>	mbooth: yes
Sep 19 11:52:54 <nboldt>	I just removed openjdk 1.8 and downgraded to 1.7, and rh-eclipse46-base is installing again in F24
Sep 19 11:53:02 <nboldt>	so... that's a feature-not-a-bug there
Sep 19 11:53:31 *	nboldt downloads the internet and 230 yum packages again...
Sep 19 12:02:04 <rgrunber>	if you've downloaded the internet.. what's another 230 yum packages added to the list.
Sep 19 12:03:39 <nboldt>	rgrunber: true
Sep 19 12:04:24 <nboldt>	so... ok. I have a jenkins rpm build working now for both master (devstudio 10.2) and 4.4.1.x branch (devstudio 10.1 sources). the master one fires every time upstream devstudio product build runs
Sep 19 12:04:58 <nboldt>	now we just need to ensure that we're not installing too much/too little (cc: mbooth) and that everything in devstudio Actually Works 
Sep 19 12:05:29 <mbenitez>	nboldt, from the developer program you should have access to a RHEL 7  subscription I think...
Sep 19 12:05:44 <mbenitez>	but send me a note if you need something else
Sep 19 12:06:07 *	mbenitez at full day PCP mtgs Mon-Wed thus slow responses
Sep 19 12:07:25 <nboldt>	mbenitez: PCP? Yeah, that would make you slow. :D https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine#Effects
Sep 19 12:07:43 *	nboldt wonders what PCP stands for (for real) in this context
Sep 19 12:07:50 <mbenitez>	haha different pcp performance co-pilot
Sep 19 12:08:35 <nboldt>	yeah, the drug's definitely not described as helping performance :D ... quite the opposite
Sep 19 12:10:26 <rgrunber>	blame fche
Sep 19 12:20:40 <mbooth>	nboldt: It's interesting that devstudio ships "org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility.auth" considering that bundle was deleted upstream years ago... http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.runtime.git/commit/bundles/org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility.auth?id=9c85295f0b0431a27bf4108ae28cf25fc3f7dec4
Sep 19 12:22:01 <fche>	WHAT WHAT WHAT ???!
Sep 19 12:22:23 <fche>	(re. 10 mins ago)
Sep 19 12:22:29 <fche>	(my minions informed me of my name being taken in vain)
Sep 19 12:24:20 <nboldt>	mbooth: maybe something depends on it. We generally don't carry obsolete  garbage along for no reason :D
Sep 19 12:24:49 <nboldt>	if I had to guess I'd say it's because of integration stack being 6-12 months behind us in moving to latest Eclipse
Sep 19 12:26:29 <nboldt>	fche: unclear as to the context for rgrunber's comment "blame fche". Riffing on South Park movieism?
Sep 19 12:26:48 <rgrunber>	nboldt: pretty sure he named PCP ..
Sep 19 12:26:56 <nboldt>	rgrunber: oic
Sep 19 12:27:00 <nboldt>	THAT context :D
Sep 19 12:27:30 *	fche didn't name pcp
Sep 19 12:27:41 <fche>	some boffins from sgi did some twenty years gao
Sep 19 12:27:42 <fche>	ago

Sep 20 11:03:06 <jorton>	mbenitez: mbooth: hi folks, can you get the rh-eclipse46 errata back on QE asap?  last one outstanding https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/24366
Sep 20 11:04:52 <mbenitez>	jorton, it's almost done, will be in QE before EOD no problem
Sep 20 11:07:04 <jorton>	mbenitez: great, thanks!
Sep 20 11:07:16 <mbenitez>	np!
Sep 20 11:16:14 <nboldt1>	mistria: mbooth: any topics for today's build.next call? if not I'll cancel it
Sep 20 11:17:01 <nboldt1>	only item left from last week is the one about setting up a user for generating and pushing PRs into jbdevstudio-website and jbosstools-download.jboss.org repos when it's time to push out a stage or release build
Sep 20 11:17:10 <nboldt1>	but that's not a discussion, it's an action item :D
Sep 20 11:17:25 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Nothing from me
Sep 20 11:18:01 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: mbooth: rgrunber: looks like all my subtasks/bugs with the rh-eclipse46-devstudio rpm are squashed/done. devstudio runs super slow on my machine when installed from rpm, but it works
Sep 20 11:18:25 <nboldt1>	could be memory setting defaults in the rh-eclipse46-base are too low for optimal devstudio performance
Sep 20 11:18:33 <nboldt1>	but for beta quality I'm happy
Sep 20 11:19:16 <mistria>	nboldt1: no topic for me
Sep 20 11:19:58 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, it is good to hear there's a working beta, nice job
Sep 20 11:21:09 <nboldt1>	mistria: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-23159 comments welcome
Sep 20 11:21:46 <nboldt1>	hey, is having a Trash folder in google calendar new, or has that always been there? 
Sep 20 11:23:06 <akurtakov>	ericwill: here?
Sep 20 11:23:19 <ericwill>	akurtakov hey
Sep 20 11:23:32 <akurtakov>	ericwill: seen my comment on the error handler?
Sep 20 11:24:30 <ericwill>	akurtakov just saw it, will revert the fix and allow Stefan to re-do
Sep 20 11:24:46 <akurtakov>	well, don't revert
Sep 20 11:24:48 <akurtakov>	this is ugly game
Sep 20 11:25:04 <akurtakov>	but be more careful when someone tries to expose api
Sep 20 11:25:20 <akurtakov>	as long as we get a buy in from Stefan soon we should be fine
Sep 20 11:25:33 <ericwill>	okay
Sep 20 11:25:36 <ericwill>	a buy in?
Sep 20 11:25:41 <akurtakov>	if no response from him in the next few days revert on Friday
Sep 20 11:26:04 <ericwill>	kk
Sep 20 11:27:08 <akurtakov>	ah, actually revert
Sep 20 11:27:14 <akurtakov>	he bumped the version too
Sep 20 11:27:33 <akurtakov>	and we already bumped in the oxygen train so definetely a no-go
Sep 20 11:28:30 <akurtakov>	ericwill: ^
Sep 20 11:28:47 <ericwill>	akurtakov will do
Sep 20 11:28:58 <ericwill>	akurtakov on master, does your SWT tools work?
Sep 20 11:29:03 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: so now I just need to figure out how to deliver it... have to publish in such a way it's installable from a yum repo
Sep 20 11:29:16 <akurtakov>	ericwill: what do you mean?
Sep 20 11:29:20 <akurtakov>	what issue do you see
Sep 20 11:29:27 <nboldt1>	eg., throw it up on devstudio.redhat.com/10.0/stable/yum_repo/ something something
Sep 20 11:29:43 <ericwill>	akurtakov the SWT tools plugin threw an error telling me that the JNI build failed
Sep 20 11:29:49 <ericwill>	also, I see an error in the SWT build path
Sep 20 11:29:51 <ericwill>	"Build path entry is missing: org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT Program/gnome"
Sep 20 11:30:08 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, agreed, I think both you and akurtakov were going to put together a not of the suggested solution to send out to rcm for agreement, then I could follow up with PM and anybody else required
Sep 20 11:30:08 <ericwill>	might be related?
Sep 20 11:31:11 <ericwill>	ah, removing that entry from the source seems to fix the problem
Sep 20 11:31:13 <akurtakov>	that should be fixed with tomorrows swttools
Sep 20 11:57:01 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: what do you know about repo.eclipse.org ? eg. login accounts.. ?
Sep 20 11:59:40 <rgrunber>	hmm nvm seems to be my committer id as opposed to email.
Sep 20 12:58:13 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I am now just waiting for errata waivers that cannot do my self (secalert and releng persmissions only) :-(
Sep 20 13:34:29 <mbenitez>	mbooth, that is great [your job, not the part about waiting]
Sep 20 13:35:22 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Security guys got back pretty quickly, just need releng now
Sep 20 13:35:32 <mbenitez>	nice!
Sep 20 13:36:20 <mbenitez>	mbooth, have you tried pinging #releng ? with easy waivers sometimes anybody there can help
Sep 20 13:36:41 <mbooth>	I will give it a try
Sep 20 13:51:09 <mbenitez>	mbooth, thanks, if not just send a note to jorton / vkadlcik_gone telling them that's the only bit missing [which should happen overnight] and consider the hand off done
Sep 20 16:06:43 <nboldt1>	dumb question for mbooth mbenitez akurtakov ... if we decide on a URL from which the devstudio rpm can be installed ... and that gets codified into rhscl somehow... what's the minimum that needs to be on that URL so as to NOT cause yum to barf an error?
Sep 20 16:07:02 <nboldt1>	want to preload some URL with an empty site, then later stick in the actual rpm content etc
Sep 20 16:07:17 <nboldt1>	once I've read thru https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CreateLocalRepos and started building it
Sep 20 16:09:17 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Can you install from this URL? http://wonka.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/RHDS/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.rpm_master/20160920.1853.3800af6/
Sep 20 16:09:22 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Looks like a valid repo
Sep 20 16:09:49 <nboldt1>	as opposed to http://wonka.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/RHDS/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.rpm_master/20160920.1853.3800af6/repodata/ ?
Sep 20 16:09:50 <mbenitez>	at least temporarily that could be the POC
Sep 20 16:10:20 <nboldt1>	well, then use http://wonka.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/RHDS/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.rpm_10.0.neon/20160920.1303.9afcc44/ since that has devstudio 10.1 in it, not 10.2
Sep 20 16:10:29 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, as per the minimum I think Alex mentioned the metadata
Sep 20 16:11:00 <mbenitez>	e.g. createrepo [may work even in an empty dir, I haven't tried]
Sep 20 16:11:00 <nboldt1>	mbenitez:  you mean an empty file with nothing in it, called http://wonka.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/RHDS/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.rpm_10.0.neon/20160920.1303.9afcc44/repodata/repomd.xml ?
Sep 20 16:12:41 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, not an empty file, just run createrepo in the dir you'll share and that will create the repodata dir & content
Sep 20 16:13:12 <nboldt1>	oic
Sep 20 16:14:20 <mbenitez>	I just tried and even for an empty dir it creates content, so that's what we'd need for an empty repo
Sep 20 16:55:21 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: akurtakov mbooth: looks like this works... repodata is already produced by the build and works. http://pastebin.com/QHyvg9ma
Sep 20 16:56:21 <nboldt1>	so we just need to agree on where we want the external-facing bits to sit and I need to generate a /latest/ symlink for each build, plus enable automated snapshot/CI cleanup
Sep 20 16:56:59 <nboldt1>	so these URLs look reasonable ? (see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4054 ) or are those a blasphemy in the rhel world?
Sep 20 17:00:19 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, excellent :)
Sep 20 17:01:47 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, I don't see anything shocking in those links
Sep 20 17:04:21 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: ok, then I'll follow the existing devstudio style of links/and/nesting/of/content
Sep 20 17:04:29 *	nboldt1 goes to make the automated magic happen
Sep 20 17:05:20 <nboldt1>	um, if we agree that we want to use https://devstudio.redhat.com/10.0/staging/builds/devstudio-10.1.0.GA-build-rpm/latest/x86_64/ for the latest build of the rpm that we're willing to suggest is "probably fine but needs QE approval"
Sep 20 17:05:59 <nboldt1>	... how do we get that URL into a /etc/yum.repos.d/something.repo file so it's part of rhscl ?
Sep 20 17:07:22 <nboldt1>	and then in December when we go better-than-beta, how do we put in the URL for 10.1 or 10.2 bits?
Sep 20 17:08:02 <nboldt1>	also I guess you'd want a URL that doesn't have to change w/ each release of devstudio, right? you want one URL that will provider endusers with 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, etc.  all from the same repo. correct?

Sep 21 10:21:24 <akurtakov>	serving similar purposes as dbus-java
Sep 21 10:21:50 <akurtakov>	but this is just smth in the would-be-nice-to-have-one-day-in-the-distant-future thing :)
Sep 21 10:22:05 <rgrunber>	so there are slight issues with libmatthew on maven central side.. afaict org.abstractj.libmatthew:libunix is only the 64 bit verison.
Sep 21 10:22:53 <akurtakov>	is it same for orbit?
Sep 21 10:23:06 <rgrunber>	i'd have to see who is using it.. it isn't in Orbit.
Sep 21 10:24:08 <rgrunber>	in Fedora we get lucky because we just place the .so on the jni path so System.loadLibrary works.. in eclipse upstream land we'll have to actually make it its own osgi bundle fragment most likely.
Sep 21 10:26:22 <rgrunber>	iot.smarthome might be using it.
Sep 21 10:26:37 <rgrunber>	just imagine libmatthew in a fridge..
Sep 21 10:31:40 <rgrunber>	well they definitely use the java side.. i don't see the native so though.. https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/tree/master/bundles/io/org.eclipse.smarthome.io.transport.dbus/lib
Sep 21 10:38:45 <rgrunber>	well its not used in any feature so maybe it doesn't even work..

Sep 21 12:07:25 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Sorry for forcing you to interact with your calendar, I know how it's your favourite kind of software ;-)
Sep 21 12:09:24 <akurtakov>	I have to learn it :)
Sep 21 12:17:44 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: mbooth so this is how/what is being excluding in orbit-recipes for bcprov http://git.eclipse.org/c/orbit/orbit-recipes.git/tree/bouncycastle/org.bouncycastle.bcprov_1.52.0/pom.xml#n15
Sep 21 12:37:04 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Interesting, what was the rationale?
Sep 21 12:40:08 <rgrunber>	they don't really mention in the cqs.. you'd think someone would have asked 'why'
Sep 21 12:40:53 <akurtakov>	mbooth: there is some noise but I'll learn how to deal with this stupid calendar
Sep 21 12:42:12 <nboldt>	akurtakov: only 4 emails to schedule a call. I've seen worse. :D
Sep 21 12:42:48 <akurtakov>	nboldt: I just got used to zimbra when the move happened
Sep 21 12:43:04 <rgrunber>	mbooth: I guess for IDEA it's because a swiss firm holds the patent and has only given permission for free noncommercial use.
Sep 21 12:43:11 <nboldt>	zimbra is the worst. only thing it had going for it is better filtering. gmail sucks for that
Sep 21 12:43:29 <akurtakov>	and google calendar is huge step back, thankfully there is gnome-calendar
Sep 21 12:43:54 <nboldt>	after 5+ years of thunderbird + zimbra, moving to gmail/gcal was like catching a perfect wave and not falling off into the rocks
Sep 21 12:44:56 <rgrunber>	hmm nvm.. looks like the patents expired.. still no idea then why it's excluded.
Sep 21 12:45:30 *	mbooth waits for worldwide patent reform....
Sep 21 12:45:35 <mbooth>	Life will be easier then
Sep 21 12:46:51 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yeah it's the patent issue..
Sep 21 12:47:34 <akurtakov>	nboldt: I simply can't get the ui of google calendar and it's so unnatural to me that I fail terribly at simplest things like figuring the next meetings, could be just me not getting it :)
Sep 21 12:47:55 <rgrunber>	'I may have been able to find a workaround to an issue with the previous version'
Sep 21 12:47:58 <rgrunber>	we reviewed.  Version 1.3.5 contained some algorithms, one of which is the
Sep 21 12:48:01 <rgrunber>	symmetric cipher IDEA, which is  still patented in some countries. And while
Sep 21 12:48:03 <rgrunber>	MediaCrypt wants to make this highly secure algorithm widely available, and the
Sep 21 12:48:06 <rgrunber>	non-commercial use of this algorithm is free, whenever you or your company
Sep 21 12:48:08 <rgrunber>	sells any products or use any application which includes the IDEA algorithm for
Sep 21 12:48:11 <rgrunber>	commercial activities, in any of the countries listed below, you require a
Sep 21 12:48:13 <rgrunber>	license granted by MediaCrypt.
Sep 21 12:48:47 <nboldt>	mbooth: can you open a subtask under https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-3982 listing the places where jbt/ds plugins should be using import-package instead of require-bundle?
Sep 21 12:49:12 <nboldt>	then I can start crackin' skulls to get that fixed in devstudio 10.2 / jbt 4.4.2
Sep 21 12:49:22 <mbooth>	nboldt: Sure, thanks
Sep 21 12:50:06 <nboldt>	akurtakov: it's not just you. saw recently that google calendar includes a trash function but can't for the life of me figure out where trashed calendar events are accessed. in theory you can recover them (undelete them)
Sep 21 12:50:44 <nboldt>	and the fact that gmail's filters are applied to ALL mail in a random order, with no "stop filtering" ability or filtering sequence ... serious flaw
Sep 21 12:56:56 <mbooth>	nboldt: Hmm, did you make that version number change before I commented on Jira? I probably should actually read code before I wade in with my opinions....
Sep 21 12:57:28 <akurtakov>	nboldt: you know we have http://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/SpecfileEditor/User_Guide 
Sep 21 12:58:06 <nboldt>	mbooth: Great Minds (Think Alike) :D
Sep 21 12:58:07 <akurtakov>	with shortcut to even generate changelog entry for you - coming from the commit I looked with fixes for the day of week
Sep 21 12:59:08 <nboldt>	akurtakov: that's cool. haven't used it in ages. forgot it exists. (I mostly work in Sublime these days.)
Sep 21 12:59:49 <nboldt>	does it handle properly inserting variables from commandline? been trying to pass through stuff from build.sh -> rpmbuild but spec file refuses to see my vars
Sep 21 13:00:29 <akurtakov>	no change in this area it calls rpmbuild underneat
Sep 21 13:00:38 <nboldt>	at the end of the day it doesn't really matter so I gave up. more important is making Eclipse + devstudio start up in less than 5 mins and actually work when it's started. Waiting full minutes for Red Hat Central to appear, load, and do anything is pretty weaksauce
Sep 21 13:01:59 <mbooth>	nboldt: FWIW, you should be able to pass vars into mock
Sep 21 13:02:25 <mbooth>	E.g.: mock -r ... --define "with_extra_cheese 1"
Sep 21 13:03:04 <nboldt>	yea, that's what I tried but the syntax to then make the value of the defined var appear was not working for me
Sep 21 13:03:28 <nboldt>	%{with_extra_cheese} became %{with_extra_cheese} instead of 1
Sep 21 13:03:48 <nboldt>	some doc said to use %{-with_extra_cheese*} but that failed too
Sep 21 13:04:13 <nboldt>	tldr, wasted time and got no where... just to see about embedding the github sha in the version string
Sep 21 13:05:15 <mbooth>	Pretty annoying, oh well
Sep 21 13:08:20 <nboldt>	mbooth: well, I could always just use bash to rename the .rpm files after they're built, right? 
Sep 21 13:08:40 <nboldt>	or wait, does the version get embedded in the repodata/* files? if so, that's a big nope.
Sep 21 13:09:30 <nboldt>	mbooth: one of these days when we're bored and have nothing to do, I'd like to come up to speed more on what you do releng-wise. Want to get my hands dirtier in rpm-land
Sep 21 13:10:02 <mbooth>	nboldt: Embedded in repodata, the rpm itself...
Sep 21 13:10:16 <mbooth>	Probably not safe to rename :-)
Sep 21 13:13:26 <nboldt>	mbooth: yep. figured

Sep 22 10:04:56 <scela>	mistria: I want to investigate a bit what they are doing with the reconcilers
Sep 22 10:05:17 <mistria>	scela: I believe it's an organizational reason
Sep 22 10:05:30 <mistria>	scela: it was done by people considering themselves WTP, not Platform
Sep 22 10:05:38 <scela>	mistria: and btw, the next important thing we need to add to the editor infra is the marker support (problem warning etc.)
Sep 22 10:05:43 <scela>	mistria: ok
Sep 22 10:05:54 <scela>	mistria: have you ever played with it?
Sep 22 10:06:26 <mistria>	scela: the issue with all those SSE editors is that they require a DOM, conforming to WTP APIs
Sep 22 10:06:42 <scela>	mistria: not sure what an xml editor means, if there is no DTD
Sep 22 10:07:06 <mistria>	scela: so they parse, they put "content-types" on the tokens of the files, and you hook features to "tokens"
Sep 22 10:07:42 <scela>	mistria: not sure what 'token' and 'feature' mean in that sentence
Sep 22 10:10:12 <mistria>	scela: DTD or xsd. When there's no such schema available, WebTools editor verified tag are properly open/closed, completes according to other existing tags (infer from existing document)
Sep 22 10:10:37 <mistria>	scela" a token ~= a word or a sentence; feature = completion, hover...
Sep 22 10:10:53 <mistria>	scela: about error markers, I'm not sure it has to be in the editor
Sep 22 10:10:57 <scela>	ok
Sep 22 10:11:06 <scela>	mistria: where do they lookup for dtd/xsd?
Sep 22 10:11:12 <scela>	mistria: do they have a kind of list?
Sep 22 10:11:28 <scela>	mistria: or just check header declaration?
Sep 22 10:11:39 <mistria>	scela: for the language server, I just hook a listener on file change (or this could be a builder), which takes care of that
Sep 22 10:12:26 <mistria>	scela: they either check in the header, or for specific files such as Maven, they have the schema hardcoded or stored somewhere
Sep 22 10:13:36 <scela>	mistria: not sure why people have to depend on WTP to get this functionality
Sep 22 10:14:28 <scela>	mistria: but anyway, I can start with something minimalistic targeting some well known DTDs
Sep 22 10:15:01 <scela>	mistria: do you have handy a git repo link where this WTP xml editor is hosted?
Sep 22 10:19:41 <mbenitez>	nboldt, hi Nick, would JBDS-3984 be the main jira to track for the RPM work?
Sep 22 10:24:58 <nboldt>	mbenitez: yes, that's the one in Trello too
Sep 22 10:28:26 <mbenitez>	nboldt, should have thought about trello... thanks!
Sep 22 10:29:48 <nboldt>	mbenitez: no, it's good. don't think about trello and it won't exist :D
Sep 22 10:30:13 <nboldt>	with CDK moving to JIRA there's pretty much no reason to use trello anymore, IMHO
Sep 22 10:30:48 <mbenitez>	haha wishful thinking may work :D
Sep 22 10:31:06 <nboldt>	well, consider all the people in here who are pretending that HipChat doesn't exist?
Sep 22 10:31:12 <nboldt>	it's working for them :D
Sep 22 10:31:22 <mbenitez>	in any case we'll be using almighty soon
Sep 22 10:31:29 <nboldt>	lol, "soon"
Sep 22 10:31:40 <mbenitez>	:)
Sep 22 10:32:01 *	nboldt is reminded of that time the official release of Windows 9x was due "Real Soon Now" .. for about 3 years
Sep 22 10:32:15 <nboldt>	the release that became known as '95
Sep 22 11:33:22 <nboldt>	... but sounds like Almighty is due a lot sooner than 3 yrs :D
Sep 22 11:33:50 <nboldt>	mbooth: rgrunber: question for you in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4059
Sep 22 11:34:04 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i'm just looking.. do we need xulrunner at all ?
Sep 22 11:34:11 <nboldt>	yes
Sep 22 11:34:15 <rgrunber>	i mean we should be using webkit
Sep 22 11:34:24 <nboldt>	unless you want no visual editor in the devstudio rpm version of devstudio
Sep 22 11:34:35 <nboldt>	talk to ilya buziak about that
Sep 22 11:34:46 <nboldt>	I don't know what the degraded/improved experience would be
Sep 22 11:35:01 <nboldt>	maybe we could change this in devstudio 10.2 ? finally drop xulrunner entirely?
Sep 22 11:35:33 <nboldt>	also wondering who/how/where to get something in a .repo file added to rh-eclipse46-base so rh-eclipse46-devstudio can be discovered by yum search
Sep 22 11:35:34 <rgrunber>	things like Orbit2, gnome-vfs ring a bell maybe from back when we used xulrunner in Fedora.. so if xulrunner is needed then seems sane-ish..
Sep 22 11:36:50 <nboldt>	re: .repo stuff... https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4054 < rgrunber 
Sep 22 11:37:01 <rgrunber>	also would this clash in any way with our webkit provider.. i mean iirc the Browser code needs to select one.. and we've always assumed xulrunner was disabled.
Sep 22 11:43:48 <rgrunber>	nboldt: should probably mention to Alex next week. I think the issue in the past was that xulrunner as updating so quickly that it became difficult to support a newer version between major eclipse releases.
Sep 22 11:44:29 <rgrunber>	but if others are maintaining the support or pushing the work upstream then maybe it can work.
Sep 22 11:51:17 <mbooth>	nboldt: Re shipping a yum repo file -- we talked about this previously, IIRC there will probably be some bureaucracy to clear for that since RHEL folks might not like us shipping third-party repos
Sep 22 11:55:41 <nboldt>	mbooth: third party ? jboss is a third party to rhel?
Sep 22 11:56:27 <mbooth>	nboldt: Well, by that I mean to say it is outside the control of RHEL rel-eng, not gated by errata tool, etc
Sep 22 11:56:42 <nboldt>	ah, fair enough. :D anyway just wanted to make sure I left the next step in the right hands so it gets worked efficiently
Sep 22 11:57:10 <nboldt>	would like to mark all my rpm stuff done and hand it over the wall to the nest person, which I guess might mean opening a RH BZ? 
Sep 22 11:57:23 <nboldt>	not sure what the process / next steps are
Sep 22 11:57:38 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I don't remember what needs to happen (who to speak to) to get approval for this sort of thing
Sep 22 11:58:11 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Re above conversation about shipping a yum repo file for getting devstudio
Sep 22 11:59:12 <mbenitez>	mbooth, I think we'll need to talk to releng and get approval from PM, if you guys put together a note about the situation I can then fwd it / discuss with PM
Sep 22 12:00:17 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Okay
Sep 22 12:00:54 <mbooth>	nboldt: In the worst case, you can ship the repo file in the devstudio rpm -- it requires the user to download manually once, but they'll get updates from then on
Sep 22 12:01:06 <mbooth>	I'll put this into an email
Sep 22 12:03:08 <nboldt>	mbooth: thanks. You can start from https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4054?focusedCommentId=13296665&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13296665 for content and sample .repo file
Sep 22 12:03:33 <mbenitez>	yes please, the more details you include the best 
Sep 23 09:03:46 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff. I can see you're logged in BJ but I can't hear/see you  
Sep 23 10:09:06 <mbenitez>	PSA: company meeting on now
Sep 23 11:26:18 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: could we discuss again about https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/68530/ ? I know the bug was fixed, but the goal of the rewrite of the DockerConnection#listImages was to have it aligned with the DockerConnection#listContainers and what I liked in this method is that the 'images' field of the DockerConnection is set in the 'finally{}' block at the end of the method, which means that we would not need the local 'latestImages' variable in Docke
Sep 23 12:06:52 <lufimtse>	I'm udating org.eclipse.jdt.ui. I'm adding a '@since' tag, do I use the "Version" field from plugin.xml for the version number?
Sep 23 12:08:06 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: i think.. sort of. for @since tag you generally only need to put '@since ${major}.${minor}'
Sep 23 12:08:29 <rgrunber>	where that is the development version under which the change was introduced..
Sep 23 12:08:54 <lufimtse>	Is there a away to auto populate that thing? I tried ctrl+space
Sep 23 12:09:04 <lufimtse>	But I know sometimes it fills it in
Sep 23 12:10:17 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: well if you use an api baseline (and have issues set to show as errors), it should show be possible to add the correct version.
Sep 23 12:39:29 <lufimtse>	Does anyone know how to get hold of Dani Mergert on IRC?
Sep 23 12:39:31 <lufimtse>	is he on irc?
Sep 23 12:53:30 <rgrunber>	doesn't seem to be on eclipse-dev (at least under an alias i recognize)
Sep 23 12:53:41 <rgrunber>	daniel_megert@ch.ibm.com ?
Sep 23 15:15:56 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, that I believe is his email.
Sep 23 15:16:10 <lufimtse>	need irc or some chat handle. I've asked him.
Sep 23 15:20:17 <lufimtse>	Hmm, seems like Eclipse can now show the return value of a method call
Sep 23 15:20:18 <lufimtse>	New Eclipse feature: See return value during debugging | Coffee Oriented Programming https://coffeeorientedprogramming.com/2016/09/23/eclipse-see-return-value-during-debugging/
Sep 23 15:20:27 <lufimtse>	new-ish feature
Sep 23 15:30:58 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: yeah i have to remember to browse the milestone N&N list every now and then to see what's new.

Sep 26 10:58:27 <scela>	rgrunber: hey, thanks
Sep 26 11:01:41 <rgrunber>	scela: regarding your upcoming lucene 6.x changes, code recommenders kind of latched onto 5.x and wanted lucene-queries added as well.. so when you propose 6.x, same may happen.
Sep 26 11:03:08 <scela>	rgrunber: there were quite some breaking changes from 5 to 6
Sep 26 11:03:12 <scela>	at least on platform level
Sep 26 11:03:29 <scela>	so not sure how that would work out
Sep 26 11:03:46 <scela>	i got swamped on some platform stuff today so couldn't make it to the lucene CQs
Sep 26 11:04:02 <rgrunber>	ah ok
Sep 26 11:04:07 <scela>	rgrunber: i'll definitely start them tomorrow and will ping you to discuss them
Sep 26 11:04:21 <rgrunber>	yeah should be easy to push them this time.. no giant wait.
Sep 26 11:04:58 <scela>	rgrunber: well you're the Orbit king now so it would be a shame to wait ;)
Sep 26 11:05:18 <rgrunber>	heh, love that title.

Sep 26 12:10:40 <nboldt>	... or something like that... need more coffee I think

Sep 27 11:26:00 <akurtakov>	mistria: ^
Sep 27 11:32:37 <mistria>	akurtakov: yes, it could be used for that purpose
Sep 27 11:32:48 <mistria>	akurtakov: I don't remember we already discussed it on bugzilla
Sep 27 11:33:05 <akurtakov>	ok, I needed an entry point for the whole thing
Sep 27 11:33:18 <mistria>	akurtakov: then this one could be fine I guess
Sep 27 11:33:34 <akurtakov>	yup, just fine
Sep 27 11:33:52 <mistria>	akurtakov: I can start the discussion here and include LSP4J project leads
Sep 27 11:34:04 <mistria>	akurtakov: would putting the LSP extensions in LSP4J work for you?
Sep 27 11:34:12 <akurtakov>	should be fine
Sep 27 11:34:45 <akurtakov>	only concern being implying xtext on everyone

Sep 28 10:37:39 <akurtakov_>	mistria: the one from swt
Sep 28 10:37:41 <akurtakov_>	:)
Sep 28 10:40:41 <scela>	mistria: CTabFolderRenderer IIRC
Sep 28 10:41:27 <scela>	rgrunber: so akurtakov_ is saying https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt and https://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt should be kind of equivalents to our CLAs
Sep 28 10:42:07 <rgrunber>	yes, but do contributors actually sign them ?
Sep 28 10:42:25 <akurtakov_>	rgrunber: it's a must have for apache projects
Sep 28 10:42:37 <akurtakov_>	in the same way eclipse cla is for eclipse projects IIRC
Sep 28 10:42:39 <rgrunber>	i mean even in their contribution guidelines i didn't see anything like 'please make sure you sign this'
Sep 28 10:46:08 <rgrunber>	k, you may be right..
Sep 28 10:46:10 <akurtakov_>	rgrunber: http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html
Sep 28 10:46:10 <rgrunber>	https://www.apache.org/licenses/
Sep 28 10:46:24 <akurtakov_>	from it A committer is a developer that was given write access to the code repository and has a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file
Sep 28 10:47:11 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I had to sign it at my previous job -- pretty sure its mandatory
Sep 28 10:47:51 <scela>	bottom line I include these two links in the box
Sep 28 10:47:59 <scela>	akurtakov_: rgrunber ^ ?
Sep 28 10:48:02 <rgrunber>	k then the option should be that is has one im place
Sep 28 10:48:15 <rgrunber>	in*
Sep 28 10:48:26 <akurtakov_>	I agree
Sep 28 10:48:53 <akurtakov_>	fwiw, everytime you face apache project and has question look for smth similar to eclipse :)
Sep 28 10:49:05 <akurtakov_>	for the organizational part I mean
Sep 28 10:49:43 <mbooth>	apache.org in some ways is worse for bureaucracy
Sep 28 10:50:03 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: hmm, how so ?
Sep 28 10:50:38 <mbooth>	Hmm, actually, that might not be true since I never served on PMC for eclipse.org project, I cannot compare
Sep 28 10:51:00 <mbooth>	I realised I compared apache PMC versus eclipse Commiter :-)
Sep 28 10:52:46 <akurtakov_>	well, apache pmc has the duti of eclipse pmc and project leads
Sep 28 10:52:49 <akurtakov_>	AFAIK
Sep 28 10:53:09 <akurtakov_>	but overall not much of a difference :)
Sep 28 10:55:05 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: are you still active on some apache project?
Sep 28 10:55:33 <scela>	rgrunber: so I filled up the whole thing, clicked submit and it said 'no logged in user'
Sep 28 10:55:46 <scela>	rgrunber: all filled data was also lost
Sep 28 10:57:01 <mbooth>	akurtakov_: I am on the pmc for one small and mostly inactive project. I keep trying to get it terminated since the sponsoring organisation lost interest in it and many of the original committers moved on
Sep 28 10:57:25 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: which one?
Sep 28 10:57:46 <mbooth>	akurtakov_: http://bloodhound.apache.org/
Sep 28 10:57:52 <akurtakov_>	ah the trac clone :0

Sep 28 13:07:32 <lufimtse>	Is the etherpad for agile thing up yet?
Sep 28 13:08:03 <lufimtse>	This guy? http://eclipse.etherpad.corp.redhat.com/sprint-planning
Sep 28 13:09:08 <rgrunber>	that's the one.
Sep 28 13:09:25 <lufimtse>	kk
Sep 28 13:53:18 <rgrunber>	mbooth: so with just installing devstudio + whatever else it depends on, and then removing bundles mentioned, it's down to 38s .. and according to profiler, 30s are just in reconciler's Activator.start.
Sep 28 16:04:50 <lufimtse>	@all, is there any code in platfom.ui that does different things depending on underlying OS?
Sep 28 16:04:57 <lufimtse>	(in general...)
Sep 28 16:05:06 <lufimtse>	or is there a rule to be consistent?
Sep 28 16:05:21 <lufimtse>	Well, I suppose there is the CSS engine... ?
Sep 28 16:07:02 <rgrunber>	well there might be to some extent.. i do see references to isLinux/isWindows
Sep 28 16:07:35 <rgrunber>	references to GTK
Sep 28 16:08:05 <lufimtse>	ok, thanks, that's what I was looking for.
Sep 28 16:09:13 <rgrunber>	just do a grep for GTK (or IS_GTK, WS_GTK for more specific things).. though honestly there aren't that many

Sep 29 03:08:31 <mistria>	scela: I don't know

Sep 29 03:08:53 <mistria>	scela: let him have a look
Sep 29 03:11:22 <mistria>	scela: I think the pattern of reports with this suite is <pluginId>.xml
Sep 29 03:11:32 <mistria>	scela: that's the JUnit report that seems missing
Sep 29 03:12:48 <scela>	mistria: but he's saying the tests weren't run at all

Sep 30 04:56:48 <scela>	https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.text.git/tree/org.eclipse.ui.genericeditor.tests/test.xml?id=4de07cf7328f19fab490c4c93b34aca5ef00c30b
Sep 30 04:56:57 <scela>	mistria: line 32
Sep 30 04:57:17 <scela>	should be org.eclipse.ui.genericeditor.tests.GenericEditorTestSuite
Sep 30 04:57:21 <scela>	this is probably the issue
Sep 30 04:57:24 <scela>	preparing a gerrit
Sep 30 04:57:32 <mistria>	scela: ok
Sep 30 04:57:42 <mistria>	scela: I did th epatch and Sravan approved it ;)
Sep 30 04:57:49 <mistria>	scela: so I'm half culprit
Sep 30 04:58:06 <scela>	mistria: haha it's fine, i'll wrap it up for good
Sep 30 04:58:49 <akurtakov_>	the whole test infra + tests needs an update to bring it back to sanity
Sep 30 04:59:01 <akurtakov_>	but this requires dedicated resourses which we don't have
Sep 30 05:14:50 <scela>	mistria: what do you mean by "* Content-type/editor association could be included in the template." in the pde template bug?
Sep 30 05:17:28 <mistria>	scela: the template should associate the content-type with the generic editor
Sep 30 05:19:01 <scela>	mistria: to open it by default with the generic editor you mean?
Sep 30 05:19:12 <mistria>	scela: yes
Sep 30 05:19:20 <mistria>	scela: I'm trying to find the extension point name
Sep 30 05:21:59 <scela>	mistria: in org.eclipse.ui.editors you can add a contenttypebinding to an editor
Sep 30 05:22:12 <scela>	mistria: the right-click-new way
Sep 30 05:22:42 <scela>	mistria: but the o.e.ui.editors is mostly for new editors
Sep 30 05:22:48 <mistria>	scela: yes
Sep 30 05:22:59 <mistria>	scela: there's an "overrideEditorAssociation" IIRC
Sep 30 05:23:29 <mistria>	scela: there it is: http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fextension-points%2Forg_eclipse_ui_ide_editorAssociationOverride.html
Sep 30 05:24:27 <scela>	mistria: then it needs an additional dep on o.e.ui.ide
Sep 30 05:24:46 <mistria>	scela: not very elegant as contributing directly an association, but it can be enough
Sep 30 05:25:33 <scela>	mistria: yeah but we need this way as our whole thing is based on not providing a separate editor, rather 'enriching' it with this stuff
Sep 30 05:25:59 <mistria>	scela: right
Sep 30 05:26:10 <mistria>	scela: i think that's the best we can do for now
Sep 30 05:26:27 <mistria>	scela: I'm opening the bug to just add a binding to org.eclipse.ui.ediitors
Sep 30 05:27:01 <scela>	mistria: but also that one needs a new editor to get there
Sep 30 05:28:32 <mistria>	scela: I don't think so, in IEditorAssociationOverride it's just returning EditorDescriptions, not necessarily creating some
Sep 30 05:29:33 <scela>	mistria: ok. we really need to simplify this. I'm even thinking whether it makes sense to include it like this in the PDE template.
Sep 30 05:30:06 <mistria>	scela: yup
Sep 30 05:30:24 <mistria>	scela: I think it makes sense for now
Sep 30 05:33:43 <mistria>	scela: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=502837
Sep 30 05:44:59 <scela>	mistria: will you be able to look at it?
Sep 30 05:45:11 <scela>	akurtakov_: ^ it's pretty important :)
Sep 30 05:45:22 <mistria>	scela: yes
Sep 30 05:45:32 <scela>	mistria: ok
Sep 30 05:45:55 <scela>	mistria: I'll take care of the other issues related to the template in the meantime. hopefully you'll be done by then and I can use the new way.
Sep 30 05:47:13 <akurtakov_>	scela: I hope I understand it :0
Sep 30 05:48:17 <mistria>	scela: I think you'll be much faster than me
Sep 30 05:48:20 <scela>	akurtakov_: basically now you can't redefine a contentType-Editor relationship without defining a new editor in the process
Sep 30 05:48:27 <mistria>	scela: the extension will require review and agreement
Sep 30 05:48:32 <mistria>	scela: as it's public API
Sep 30 05:48:42 <mistria>	scela: the template won't require much
Sep 30 05:49:00 <scela>	mistria: yeah probably
Sep 30 05:49:12 <mistria>	scela: IMO, you should go on with the editorOverride, and once there is the extension, we'll make another iteration to use it
Sep 30 06:51:44 <scela>	akurtakov_: do we have an IM channel on Sravan?
Sep 30 06:51:58 <akurtakov_>	scela: google talk 
Sep 30 06:51:59 <akurtakov_>	why?
Sep 30 06:52:57 <scela>	akurtakov_: ah, he just reacted https://git.eclipse.org/r/82245
Sep 30 06:53:16 <akurtakov_>	scela: https://plus.google.com/u/0/108469574010541799130
Sep 30 06:54:24 <akurtakov_>	I wonder can't this test stuff rely on some annotation and a procesor which gets what to run based on it instead of hardcoding that way in a place only releng can touch
Sep 30 06:56:37 <scela>	akurtakov_: oh there are many ways to do this better, once you have the resources for it :)
Sep 30 06:56:47 <scela>	akurtakov_: up to know it has been David's magic potion
Sep 30 09:03:37 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: i think he's saying it's a rhel7 issue :P
Sep 30 09:03:58 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, this happened last week too
Sep 30 09:04:05 <rgrunber>	[X] Add heavy wind effect to all voice conversations
Sep 30 10:21:34 <scela>	mistria: here it goes .. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=502565
Sep 30 10:24:03 <scela>	mistria: nice to see people are starting to consume and trying to improve it already
Sep 30 10:34:11 <mistria>	scela: so wha'ts missing to close thise bug, a N&N entrt?
Sep 30 11:42:29 <scela>	mistria: the one i referenced is a different one, it's a request from angelo zerr
Sep 30 14:52:56 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I am trying to use Docker exec to do a simple ls on an existing running Container...when I try and read the LogStream that execStart returns, I keep getting an exception on hasNext() because it reads a set amount of bytes and reaches EOF before the expected amount which is some ridiculous high number
Sep 30 14:53:15 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I believe you were seeing this with LogThread a long time ago...do you remember what the issue was?
Sep 30 14:53:54 <rgrunber>	yes, it was that there was no support in docker-client for using readFully() or something.. let me get the commit..
Sep 30 14:54:46 <rgrunber>	ahh .. is tty enabled when you do this ?
Sep 30 14:54:59 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: yes
Sep 30 14:55:10 <rgrunber>	https://github.com/spotify/docker-client/commit/824af851013d95ff5bdf26d05241c035191d496c
Sep 30 14:55:27 <rgrunber>	it made 3.6.0
Sep 30 14:55:36 <rgrunber>	but we'r still using an older version
Sep 30 14:56:34 <jjohnstn>	thanks for the info
Sep 30 14:56:57 <rgrunber>	a bit of a pain to get it working properly until we update.
Sep 30 15:48:05 <lufimtse>	I noticed that "Require-Bundle" has an upper version of '4.0.0'. Why is that?
Sep 30 15:48:07 <lufimtse>	ex:  org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor;bundle-version="[3.10.0,4.0.0)",
Sep 30 15:48:25 <lufimtse>	why not just ="3.10.0" and leave it open ended?
Sep 30 16:07:33 <lufimtse>	 Is it so that when api breakage occurs, the main author would know about it?
Sep 30 16:13:02 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: yeah, so major version changes are permitted to break API.. and it guards against that.
Sep 30 16:13:17 <lufimtse>	Ok.
Sep 30 16:13:19 <lufimtse>	Thansk.
Sep 30 16:14:22 <rgrunber>	if it were open.. ie 3.10.0 or above, people would see it as that bundle saying it commits to support other versions above.. so if it didn't people would complain/file bugs.

Oct 03 09:29:23 <scela>	mistria: any idea?
Oct 03 09:29:31 <scela>	akurtakov_: what gtk version does this instance have?
Oct 03 09:29:39 <mistria>	scela: nope
Oct 03 09:29:41 <akurtakov_>	I think 3.14
Oct 03 09:29:49 <mistria>	scela: didn't Dani just say tests are ok now?
Oct 03 09:29:59 <scela>	mistria: no
Oct 03 09:30:10 <scela>	mistria: he said the releng tests are ok
Oct 03 09:30:17 <scela>	mistria: the bundleshape dir thing
Oct 03 09:30:25 <mistria>	scela: "The Releng test no longer failed."
Oct 03 09:30:51 <scela>	mistria: he means https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497871#c46
Oct 03 09:30:59 <mistria>	ok
Oct 03 09:33:51 <xcoulon>	mistria: hello ! Do you know if it is possible to pgrammatically disable the launchbar ? I'm not sure how to use it with SWTBot so I'd rather use the standard/legacy toolbar instead.
Oct 03 09:34:38 <mistria>	xcoulon: I've never used the launchbar nor ever integrated it nor ever read its code... sorry I can't help
Oct 03 09:35:01 <xcoulon>	mistria: ok, thanks anyway
Oct 03 09:35:25 <mistria>	xcoulon: but if you look at the code of the Customize Perspective dialog, you may find out how to do it
Oct 03 09:35:38 <xcoulon>	mistria: ok
Oct 03 10:00:06 <scela>	lufimtse: would there be any important fix between gtk 3.14 and 3.20 related to hovers?
Oct 03 10:00:30 <scela>	lufimtse: we have a test failing in 3.14 but not in 3.20 which tests hovers
Oct 03 10:00:58 <lufimtse>	scela, hey
Oct 03 10:01:33 <lufimtse>	swt doesn't have hovers. Has tooltips?
Oct 03 10:01:51 <lufimtse>	there were lots of fixes, kinda hard to tell which could affect
Oct 03 10:01:54 <lufimtse>	which test case?
Oct 03 10:02:31 <scela>	lufimtse: yeah we call that hover in the p.ui/text level so it sticks to your mind
Oct 03 10:03:24 <scela>	lufimtse: can you access https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.text.git/commit/?id=5bcb7ac5045743f9ec17895a9a12318dd90ea4cb ?
Oct 03 10:03:33 <scela>	for some reason it says no repo found for me
Oct 03 10:03:38 <scela>	probably the infra is fried again
Oct 03 10:03:59 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.text.git
Oct 03 10:04:00 <lufimtse>	works ^

Oct 03 10:04:13 <scela>	lufimtse: ^

Oct 03 10:13:17 <lufimtse>	scela, for me, works on gtk3.18, Gtk3.16
Oct 03 10:13:22 <lufimtse>	test case
Oct 03 10:13:31 <lufimtse>	I can't seem to make it fail?
Oct 03 10:13:58 <lufimtse>	in gtk there were position fixes related to tooltips I think,
Oct 03 10:14:11 <lufimtse>	Lemme know.
Oct 03 10:16:10 <scela>	lufimtse: ok thanks for taking a look
Oct 03 10:51:54 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: hipp issue should be resolved.
Oct 03 10:52:36 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: great ! and I just realized that I opened the issue with my personal account, not Red Hat's one. Bah..
Oct 03 10:52:59 <xcoulon>	so how was the problem solved ? Did CDT just publish new artifacts ?
Oct 03 10:53:40 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: that's my guess. referencing something on a hudson hipp i still see as kinda dangerous.. especially because it can disappear from things like "clean workspace" or whatnot.
Oct 03 10:54:12 <rgrunber>	it didn't say 'repository not found' so it located it at some point.. and when it tried retrieving the metadata, it failed.. could have even been a networking issue.
Oct 03 10:54:15 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I agree, but I'm not sure how it happened at the beginning, to be honest
Oct 03 10:54:35 <xcoulon>	ha ok, thanks for the explanation
Oct 03 10:54:51 <rgrunber>	i don't know if cdt offers a nightly of launchbar.. but they do offer the feature for neon.1 and i've pointed to it in the bug.
Oct 03 10:55:45 <rgrunber>	but tbh, if the issue is back to normal and happens rarely i'm fine with keeping the repo, for now.
Oct 03 10:55:58 <rgrunber>	*offers a nightly of launchbar no on the hipp.
Oct 03 11:05:15 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, I think it's the first time this happens, actually

Oct 04 07:08:27 <akurtakov_>	mistria: hey
Oct 04 07:08:34 <akurtakov_>	it's the manifest editor I see it with
Oct 04 07:08:40 <mistria>	akuartkaov_: hi
Oct 04 07:08:46 <mistria>	akurtakov_: ok
Oct 04 07:09:00 <akurtakov_>	with and without theme engine enabled
Oct 04 07:10:03 <akurtakov_>	with swt examples too
Oct 04 07:27:50 <scela>	mistria: hey
Oct 04 08:13:29 <scela>	akurtakov_: how can I check what version of gtk i have on rhel
Oct 04 08:13:39 <akurtakov_>	rpm -qi gtk3
Oct 04 08:14:01 <scela>	3.14
Oct 04 08:14:05 <akurtakov_>	or you can look in the system properties in your eclipse
Oct 04 08:14:09 <akurtakov_>	it's reported there too
Oct 04 08:14:22 <scela>	ok
Oct 04 08:14:41 <scela>	akurtakov_: all tests succeed in rhel 7.2
Oct 04 08:16:04 <scela>	akurtakov_: I'm kind of on a dead end with this test thing
Oct 04 08:16:18 <scela>	akurtakov_: only thing that's left is actually install the centos version they have there
Oct 04 08:16:37 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: ^ can you help with testing on different versions
Oct 04 08:16:44 <akurtakov_>	scela: you can try that too
Oct 04 08:17:02 <akurtakov_>	but it also could be a matter of packages installed and etc.
Oct 04 08:17:43 <scela>	akurtakov_: I had this discussion with lufimtse yesterday http://pastebin.com/5H9auKh3
Oct 04 08:19:27 <akurtakov_>	so lufimtse haven't tested 3.14 or older?
Oct 04 08:20:04 <scela>	akurtakov_: hm yes
Oct 04 08:20:47 <scela>	akurtakov_: in the meantime do you have any idea where can I get the exact centos version they have on their build server?
Oct 04 08:21:04 <akurtakov_>	talk to sravan about that
Oct 04 08:21:14 <scela>	ok
Oct 04 08:25:02 <scela>	akurtakov_: sravan is saying it's stock centos 7
Oct 04 08:25:21 <akurtakov_>	scela: that is the reason for pushing so much for reducing the versions 
Oct 04 08:25:35 <akurtakov_>	it's plain impossible to keep it up with the manpower we have
Oct 04 08:25:41 <akurtakov_>	scela: try stock centos then
Oct 04 08:25:58 <akurtakov_>	it might contian some difference with rhel 
Oct 04 08:26:08 <scela>	akurtakov_: ok
Oct 04 08:26:17 <akurtakov_>	although it's supposed to be recompile only
Oct 04 08:28:40 <scela>	akurtakov_: yeah
Oct 04 08:28:51 <scela>	akurtakov_: but there's nothing else i can try so I'll go with that
Oct 04 08:29:13 <akurtakov_>	another option that came ot me is that it coule be stock centos but not fully uptodate
Oct 04 08:31:34 <scela>	akurtakov_: there's minimal, dvd and everyting ISO
Oct 04 08:31:42 <scela>	akurtakov_: with 'everything' being 14 GB
Oct 04 08:31:48 <scela>	akurtakov_: i'm getting the dvd one
Oct 04 08:31:59 <akurtakov_>	sorry, I've never tried centos so know nothing about it
Oct 04 08:32:27 <scela>	akurtakov_: same here. we'll see how it goes
Oct 04 08:35:16 <scela>	akurtakov_: so the N build didn't actually fail today, it was just the page that didn't get generated.
Oct 04 08:41:32 <mistria>	akurtakov_: I don't see an issue with the patch I suggest and the MANIFEST.MF editor, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place
Oct 04 08:41:34 <mistria>	?
Oct 04 08:41:55 <akurtakov_>	hmm
Oct 04 08:42:00 <akurtakov_>	gtk 3.22 on my side ?
Oct 04 08:46:26 <mistria>	akurtakov_: can you share a screenshot? and make sure you're using the latest patch I submitted?
Oct 04 08:47:03 <mistria>	gtk3-3.20.6-1.fc24.x86_64
Oct 04 08:47:08 <akurtakov_>	mistria: 82376/2 ?
Oct 04 08:47:35 <mistria>	yes
Oct 04 08:48:58 <akurtakov_>	mistria: https://ibin.co/2xJMjULhSagP.png
Oct 04 08:49:09 <akurtakov_>	no white background no matter what selected
Oct 04 08:49:31 <akurtakov_>	mistria: this time even I see the issue :)
Oct 04 08:49:38 <scela>	akurtakov_: :)
Oct 04 08:50:39 <mistria>	akurtakov_: ok... can you put a breakpoint and check whether the CTabFolder handles the "Activate" event?
Oct 04 08:52:05 <akurtakov_>	mistria: hmm, actually https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/82376/2/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT+Custom+Widgets/common/org/eclipse/swt/custom/CTabFolder.java
Oct 04 08:52:13 <akurtakov_>	onActivate is not called anywhere
Oct 04 08:54:10 <akurtakov_>	mistria:  I guess you forgot part of the patch 
Oct 04 08:54:46 <mistria>	akurtakov_: so I also found a bug in Git or Gerrit ;)
Oct 04 08:55:07 <akurtakov_>	I have enough bugs :)
Oct 04 08:56:26 <akurtakov_>	scela: maybe trying to run with tests.xml
Oct 04 08:56:38 <akurtakov_>	it might setup the workbench in some other way leading to the failure ?
Oct 04 08:57:55 <scela>	akurtakov_: it may be
Oct 04 08:58:05 <scela>	but running with test.xml is no easy task
Oct 04 08:58:19 <scela>	akurtakov_: or at least that's my feeling
Oct 04 08:58:31 <scela>	akurtakov_: sravan told me he spent whole day trying to make it work and still had issues
Oct 04 08:58:38 <akurtakov_>	damn
Oct 04 08:58:56 <akurtakov_>	we have to spend some time improving this or we would not have reliable tests ever
Oct 04 09:02:43 <scela>	akurtakov_: yeah, hopefully I'll figure out something with this centos
Oct 04 09:02:52 <scela>	akurtakov_: it just installed so I'm getting eclipse now
Oct 04 09:05:41 <mistria>	akurtakov_: Patch Set 4 should be fine
Oct 04 09:06:16 <mistria>	akurtakov_: I had a compile issue on the SWT project so it was still using the version with the Activate/Deactivate events, that were lost in the rebase
Oct 04 09:06:33 <mistria>	akurtakov_: so it's neither a Git nor a Gerrit bug, more a pebcak
Oct 04 09:07:43 <akurtakov_>	mistria: 2 issues
Oct 04 09:08:07 <akurtakov_>	start CustomControlExample before clickin in it the selected tab is not white
Oct 04 09:09:09 <akurtakov_>	in eclipse with theming engine disable - click on another ctabfolder while having manifest editor open than click back on one of the manifest editor tabs
Oct 04 09:09:42 <akurtakov_>	the main editor tab becomse white but not the tab inside the editor
Oct 04 09:09:45 <akurtakov_>	mistria: ^
Oct 04 09:11:38 <akurtakov_>	mistria: note that if you click on the editor tab the sub tab highlights proper
Oct 04 09:11:48 <akurtakov_>	but not if you click on the subtab directly
Oct 04 09:13:15 <akurtakov_>	mistria: and third issue - when another ctabfolder is active on mouse hover the already selected ctab in another ctabfolder doesn't react
Oct 04 09:58:15 <rgrunber>	akurtakov_: thanks. i would think it's strange for me to +1 my own cqs.
Oct 04 09:59:52 <lufimtse>	scela, let me know if you need anything tested on any other gtk version etc...
Oct 04 10:04:18 <scela>	mbooth: hey
Oct 04 10:19:03 <akurtakov_>	rgrunber: yeah, I always felt strange to self approve :)
Oct 04 10:19:21 <akurtakov_>	but after waiting few days I have no other option but to proceed 
Oct 04 10:19:38 <rgrunber>	yeah.. i guess exception would be.. no one cares enough.. i do.. +1
Oct 04 10:19:40 <akurtakov_>	now, that there are two of us it's easier :)
Oct 04 10:22:11 <rgrunber>	nboldt: just an fyi, my patch is https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/pull/406 . i'm only slightly confused about the format. you place things that are provided by other rh-eclipse46* rpms at the bottom.. but even some stuff at the top (nicely formatted comments explaining each bundle) are things that are provided by other rh-eclipse46 rpms.. but hey they're all listed ..
Oct 04 10:28:06 <nboldt>	rgrunber: I just documented how I found the stuff to exclude, so I would be able to remember it later 
Oct 04 10:28:36 <nboldt>	we can reorg the file if you want
Oct 04 10:29:30 <mbooth>	scela: Hi
Oct 04 10:30:35 <rgrunber>	nboldt: nah it's fine. i just didn't know whether to dump it at the bottom or use the nicer format.
Oct 04 10:31:11 <nboldt>	either or. If you can explain why they should be removed, do. if you can't, then a documentationless dump at the bottom works too :D
Oct 04 10:41:38 <mbooth>	nboldt: "documentationless dump" -- hey, keep out of my github profile :-p
Oct 04 10:42:50 <scela>	mbooth: was wondering if you ever got https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform-releng/Automated_Testing to work standalone
Oct 04 10:42:58 <scela>	mbooth: i tried and it's pretty outdated
Oct 04 10:43:53 <rgrunber>	isn't that what the eclipse-testing does ?
Oct 04 10:44:38 <scela>	yes
Oct 04 10:44:54 <rgrunber>	i mean we have it in Fedora and DTS.
Oct 04 10:45:05 <mbooth>	I don't think I've seen that document before, but I think rgrunber is right
Oct 04 10:45:08 <scela>	rgrunber: is that usable for upstream?
Oct 04 10:45:30 <scela>	i basically want to replicate what happens in the ecliopse.org build servers
Oct 04 10:45:32 <mbooth>	(Except I broke it in Fedora -- temporarily, I promise)
Oct 04 10:46:13 <mbooth>	scela: Hmm, I'm not sure if it can be usable with upstream bundles though
Oct 04 10:46:38 <rgrunber>	it was heavily modified to work for Fedora/DTS.
Oct 04 10:46:40 <scela>	mbooth: that's what I actually need
Oct 04 10:46:46 <rgrunber>	and with system dependencies.
Oct 04 10:47:02 <scela>	root issue is that there is a single test failing on eclipse.org which I can not reproduce in any way locally
Oct 04 10:47:17 <scela>	so only thing left is the setup that is done by the scripts over there in that guide
Oct 04 10:47:32 <mbooth>	Oh yeah, due to differences in BSN for many bundles in Fedora, you probably cannot mix and match Fedora and upstream stuff
Oct 04 10:47:41 <scela>	that's why I need to run the tests as identically as they are run on their build servers
Oct 04 10:47:46 <scela>	mbooth: rgrunber ^
Oct 04 10:47:49 <rgrunber>	wow.. that is one tricky setup..
Oct 04 10:47:51 <nboldt>	mbooth: lol, sorry, didn't mean to cramp your style
Oct 04 10:47:54 <scela>	mbooth: yeah so it's useless for my case
Oct 04 10:48:14 <rgrunber>	could you run the individual thing headless ?
Oct 04 10:49:01 <mbooth>	scela: Can you view the upstream HIPP job configuration to see how they run it?
Oct 04 10:49:02 <rgrunber>	scela: i mean i could point you to roughly what is run when a test suite is run... it's just an ant call to eclipse equinox launcher with some parameters for the right testrunner.
Oct 04 10:49:56 <scela>	mbooth: rgrunber https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/ep47N-unit-cen64/ws/workarea/N20161002-2000/eclipse-testing/results/html/org.eclipse.ui.genericeditor.tests_ep47N-unit-cen64_linux.gtk.x86_64_8.0.html is the actual test
Oct 04 10:50:07 <scela>	along with the hudson config
Oct 04 10:50:20 <nboldt>	mistria: anything you want on the agenda for today's build.next call?
Oct 04 10:50:36 <scela>	mbooth: i suppose this is the setup https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/ep47N-unit-cen64/
Oct 04 10:51:02 <mistria>	nboldt: nope, but where is the agenda?
Oct 04 10:51:26 <nboldt>	mistria: it's empty until someone adds something
Oct 04 10:51:55 <nboldt>	mistria: I link it from http://jbds-pm.etherpad.corp.redhat.com/build-next when I have something to link
Oct 04 10:52:02 <scela>	rgrunber: usually the 'just an ant call' requires some underlying configuration already present
Oct 04 10:52:10 <nboldt>	but if no one has topics, we don't meet. :D saves time/effort
Oct 04 10:52:22 <scela>	rgrunber: right now I'm testing something from sravan who already went through this
Oct 04 10:53:47 <nboldt>	mbooth: rgrunber: dumb question ... are the eclipse-* and rh-eclipse46-* rpms updated to Neon.1 yet?
Oct 04 10:54:03 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yes and no :-)
Oct 04 10:54:04 <rgrunber>	scela: i mean i would first try to just run that testsuite headless with the testrunner.. avoiding the whole ant stuff.. just to see if that's enough to reproduce.
Oct 04 10:54:12 <mbooth>	nboldt: The platform is
Oct 04 10:54:18 <mbooth>	nboldt: Others to follow shortly
Oct 04 10:54:37 <nboldt>	mbooth: cool, just checking on status so I can let akazakov know
Oct 04 10:55:06 <nboldt>	questions get asked in HC and I have to seek answers in IRC *shakes head at why we use two tools for one purpose*
Oct 04 10:55:16 <mbooth>	HC?
Oct 04 10:55:20 <rgrunber>	hipchat
Oct 04 10:55:22 <nboldt>	hipchat
Oct 04 10:55:28 <nboldt>	where the hip go to chat
Oct 04 10:55:32 <nboldt>	about their hips
Oct 04 10:55:37 <mbooth>	Oh, I don't think I'm hip enough
Oct 04 10:55:44 <nboldt>	and their french-speaking cats
Oct 04 10:56:38 <rgrunber>	most of my chats lately have been HIPP chats
Oct 04 10:56:43 <nboldt>	only thing it has going for it that IRC doesn't have is URL expansion (dumps a preview of links into the chat) and it'll email you a note if someone @mentions you while you're AFK
Oct 04 10:57:23 <mbooth>	rgrunber: You're so HIPP, I'm surprised you can see over your own pelvis :-)
Oct 04 10:57:32 <nboldt>	IMHO if you try to IRC @mention someone and they're afk, you can email them directly. achieves the same thing
Oct 04 10:57:59 <nboldt>	if anyone wants an hipchat invite I can send 'em out. you're not missing much
Oct 04 10:58:31 <mbooth>	nboldt: Does it have IRC bridge (a la slack)?
Oct 04 10:58:45 <nboldt>	nope
Oct 04 10:59:20 <nboldt>	but if you use freenode you can embed that + hipchat + slack + g+ + fb + .... Franz
Oct 04 10:59:31 <nboldt>	so at least all your bazillion chat tools are in the same window
Oct 04 10:59:55 <nboldt>	http://meetfranz.com/ ... doesn't work for private IRC yet
Oct 04 11:01:54 <mbooth>	Can it be a non-browser window?
Oct 04 11:02:09 <nboldt>	yes, ther's a hipchat app
Oct 04 11:02:23 <nboldt>	for windows and .deb -> alien -> .rpm
Oct 04 11:05:25 <rgrunber>	scela: does this help any ? https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/ep47N-unit-cen64/ws/workarea/N20161002-2000/eclipse-testing/results/ep47N-unit-cen64_linux.gtk.x86_64_8.0/org.eclipse.ui.genericeditor.tests.GenericEditorTestSuite.txt .. '!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: "Decoration Calculation".'
Oct 04 11:06:37 <scela>	rgrunber: should be helpful yes
Oct 04 11:07:17 <scela>	rgrunber: so the framework args huge line is basically how I could theoretically run it standalone right?
Oct 04 11:08:08 <rgrunber>	yes.. however i believe as part of the framework.. there is a p2 director call to setup the environment.
Oct 04 11:08:21 <rgrunber>	let me get you a full log of just the generic editor stuff.
Oct 04 11:10:54 <rgrunber>	scela: http://paste.stg.fedoraproject.org/5468/raw/
Oct 04 11:12:05 <rgrunber>	but yeah if the instance of eclipse is set up with the right plugins.. you should be able to just run it as there.
Oct 04 11:12:09 <rgrunber>	using uitestapplication
Oct 04 11:12:59 <scela>	rgrunber: yeah I see
Oct 04 11:34:01 <akurtakov_>	what's the genericeditor bundle name ?
Oct 04 11:36:20 <mistria>	akurtakov_ org.eclipse.ui.genericeditor
Oct 04 12:15:18 <rgrunber>	mistria: for p2iu.xml, have you tried specifying optional="true" as an attribute of the <required> element.
Oct 04 12:20:29 <mistria>	rgrunber: nope
Oct 04 12:28:04 <mistria>	rgrunber: I'm on it
Oct 04 12:33:09 <rgrunber>	.. and i guess greedy=false as well
Oct 04 12:47:03 <rgrunber>	yeah.. pascal confirms.
Oct 04 12:47:38 <rgrunber>	not very well documented on the wiki page but if you look inside a content.xml you'll see it.
Oct 04 15:18:54 <nboldt>	rgrunber: any idea why I'm getting three different timestamps when creating src.rpm and rpm files?
Oct 04 15:18:56 <nboldt>	http://wonka.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/jenkins/job/devstudio.rpm_master/161/console
Oct 04 15:19:18 <nboldt>	search for devstudio-10.2-0.20161004.184 and you'll see 1842, 1843, 1844 as the timestamp
Oct 04 15:19:39 <nboldt>	but the value passed to the .spec file is only defined ONCE... is mock supposed to be incrementing the version like that?
Oct 04 15:22:39 <rgrunber>	nboldt: https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/devstudio.spec#L11 .. it would be evaluated for every srpm creation afaict.
Oct 04 15:23:09 <rgrunber>	iirc mock re-generates the srpm doesn't it ?
Oct 04 15:23:27 <nboldt>	yes. but then the .rpm (not srpm) gets another timestamp too
Oct 04 15:23:49 <nboldt>	so, I need to generate the spec file with a static value in it, rather than passing one in
Oct 04 15:23:53 <nboldt>	#lame
Oct 04 15:26:23 <rgrunber>	_datetime is passed in by you to mock ?
Oct 04 15:26:30 <rgrunber>	.. i see it commented out in the spec..
Oct 04 15:27:42 <nboldt>	yeah, I'm now passing it in from build.sh
Oct 04 15:28:05 <nboldt>	figured that would help but I see it's not. so... I will generate a .spec file with hardcoded values and see if that helps
Oct 04 15:28:33 <rgrunber>	so then that should work.. i mean there's nowhere else to get the datetime.
Oct 04 15:29:34 <nboldt>	then why is mock incrementing the version?
Oct 04 15:29:41 <rgrunber>	^ yeah..
Oct 04 15:36:36 <rgrunber>	nboldt: are you passing just a literal ? the actual date ?
Oct 04 15:40:22 <nboldt>	I thought I was
Oct 04 15:41:05 <nboldt>	rgrunber: https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/build.sh#L274
Oct 04 15:41:36 <nboldt>	maybe that's not being evaluated before sending, but instead sending the expression to the spec file?
Oct 04 15:46:10 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i was thinking that..
Oct 04 15:46:29 <rgrunber>	i mean 'define' format is a MACRO and an EXPR...
Oct 04 15:46:42 <rgrunber>	but you'd still need %expand() to do the evaluation properly no?
Oct 04 15:47:15 <nboldt>	dunno. I'm kind of flying blind here. 
Oct 04 15:47:28 <rgrunber>	i mean no.. it's in "" .. the shell should definitely evaluate that.
Oct 04 15:47:46 <nboldt>	but as I'd like to have the rpm version tied to the pom.xml / devstudio version anyway, I'm rewriting this to pass in a static value
Oct 04 15:48:43 <nboldt>	which is pulled from the pom.xml version, and a static generated timestamp
Oct 04 15:52:44 <nboldt>	rgrunber: could the problem be https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/build.sh#L296 ? I've no idea where %%VERSION is defined
Oct 04 15:52:54 <nboldt>	or %%RELEASE
Oct 04 15:53:22 <rgrunber>	i assume they're taken from the rpmc istelf.
Oct 05 07:01:20 <akurtakov>	xcoulon: how was the issue with linuxtools hipp fixed ?
Oct 05 07:48:42 <xcoulon>	akurtakov: AFAIR, rgrunber kicked another build. 
Oct 05 07:48:56 <xcoulon>	you may want to ask him if he fixed something, too. 
Oct 05 08:19:37 <patrickm>	akurtakov: i seeded the SoS update page with the weekly status information... feel free to review and modify 
Oct 05 08:20:00 <akurtakov>	patrickm: hmm, wait, I updated it already
Oct 05 08:21:20 <patrickm>	akurtakov: what the?!  i did it last night
Oct 05 08:21:41 <akurtakov>	patrickm: and I saw that, and edited it an hour ago :)
Oct 05 08:21:50 <patrickm>	akurtakov: fantastic!
Oct 05 08:22:01 <patrickm>	and thanks
Oct 05 08:30:17 <scela>	mistria: I'm dropping the failing test effort for now 
Oct 05 08:30:19 <scela>	mistria: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497871#c58
Oct 05 08:40:03 <patrickm>	akurtakov: should we mention -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1380659 
Oct 05 08:40:14 <patrickm>	akurtakov: and by we... I mean you ;)
Oct 05 08:40:36 <akurtakov>	patrickm: we get all acks ?
Oct 05 08:40:51 <akurtakov>	I'll mention it but will not make it a blocker just as some risk
Oct 05 08:41:11 <patrickm>	we did, that's new ;)
Oct 05 08:41:24 <akurtakov>	patrickm: yes, mcermak added it an hour or so ago
Oct 05 08:41:39 <akurtakov>	and said that vkadlcik_gone expects the update so
Oct 05 08:43:53 <patrickm>	fantastic
Oct 05 08:44:07 *	patrickm has one less thing to complain about 
Oct 05 09:59:55 <mistria>	scela: you're right, the failing test isn't workable as long as we don't have a new nightly
Oct 05 10:10:07 <scela>	mistria: and it doesn't look like we'll have one soon

Oct 05 12:08:50 <rgrunber>	k sounds good.
Oct 05 12:40:36 <nboldt>	akurtakov: rgrunber: initial startup of rh-eclipse46-devstudio is way better now... but after migration, remediation, and install... it's a lot worse. :( https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4059?focusedCommentId=13303105&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13303105
Oct 05 12:42:03 <rgrunber>	nboldt: this is a fresh install ?
Oct 05 12:42:12 <rgrunber>	what would there be to migrate ?
Oct 05 12:42:26 <nboldt>	no, I did an update
Oct 05 12:42:40 <nboldt>	yum update rh-eclipse46-devstudio-10.2-0.20161005.1507.el7.x86_64.rpm
Oct 05 12:42:59 <nboldt>	I'll try a fresh install next
Oct 05 12:46:38 <rgrunber>	i'll have to reproduce it to see what it's doing this time for ~7min.
Oct 05 12:48:20 *	nboldt is reinstalling from scratch
Oct 05 12:48:32 <nboldt>	having deleted my ~/.eclipse/*

Oct 05 13:11:47 <nboldt>	https://wiki.eclipse.org/Oxygen/Simultaneous_Release_Plan#Schedule rgrunber <<
Oct 05 13:12:04 <nboldt>	everyone should have that calendar subscribed in their google calendar
Oct 05 13:12:12 <rgrunber>	yup :) 
Oct 05 13:12:23 <nboldt>	for great justice!
Oct 05 13:12:41 <rgrunber>	i imported it into the system one.. really useful.
Oct 05 13:18:15 <nboldt>	rgrunber: it's definitely faster to uninstall devstudio and reinstall it from scratch than to do migration/remediation. Details in JBDS-4059
Oct 05 13:19:31 <rgrunber>	k so i'll have a look at what migration is doing.
Oct 05 13:21:49 <nboldt>	cool, thanks

Oct 07 10:39:24 *	Now talking on #eclipse
Oct 07 10:44:13 *	irc.lab.bos.redhat.com has changed the topic to: Eclipse discussions
Oct 07 10:57:42 <nboldt>	akurtakov: mbooth: looks like after installing rh-eclipse46-devstudio then doing an install from within Red Hat Central... eclipse/devstudio becomes unusable
Oct 07 10:57:56 <nboldt>	throws NPE and won't start :(
Oct 07 10:59:41 <scela>	mistria: hi
Oct 07 11:01:21 <akurtakov>	nboldt: what's the NPE ?
Oct 07 11:01:55 <nboldt>	akurtakov: http://pastebin.com/Pd2R77S3
Oct 07 11:02:20 <akurtakov>	meh, meaningless
Oct 07 11:02:41 <nboldt>	comes after a f--kton of "could not resolve module" "another singleton selected"
Oct 07 11:03:16 <nboldt>	and a pile of constraint violations (2 chains of deps to the same bundle or package)
Oct 07 11:04:01 <nboldt>	for example;
Oct 07 11:04:02 <nboldt>	  org.osgi.service.resolver.ResolutionException: Uses constraint violation. Unable to resolve resource org.eclipse.m2e.jdt [osgi.identity; type="osgi.bundle"; version:Version="1.7.0.20160603-1933"; osgi.identity="org.eclipse.m2e.jdt"; singleton:="true"] because it is exposed to package 'org.slf4j' from resources org.slf4j.api [osgi.identity; type="osgi.bundle"; version:Version="1.7.2.v20121108-1250"; osgi.identity="org.slf4j.api"] and slf4j.api 
Oct 07 11:26:49 <nboldt>	mbooth: is there a plan in place for when fedora moves to Eclipse Oxygen?
Oct 07 11:27:11 <nboldt>	is it ... july 2017? or will Fedora get a pre-GA milestone of Oxygen earlier than that?
Oct 07 11:28:55 <mbooth>	nboldt: Rawhide usually gets M6 (ish)
Oct 07 11:30:20 <nboldt>	mbooth: cool. thanks
Oct 07 12:14:05 <patrickm>	akazakov: thanks for the weekly status
Oct 07 12:16:55 <akazakov>	patrickm, you are welcome but I guess you actually wanted to thank akurtakov 
Oct 07 12:19:48 <patrickm>	akazakov: i did... autocomplete is not my friend today
Oct 07 12:20:26 <akazakov>	and similarity of our names doesn't help ;)
Oct 07 12:48:29 <nboldt>	also doesn't help that both names (almost) start with "AKA", short for "also known as" :D

Oct 12 10:42:52 <rgrunber>	mbooth: that bug against eclipse f25, .. related to glassfish-el-api retirement ?
Oct 12 10:43:05 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I think so
Oct 12 10:43:18 <rgrunber>	i saw javax.el as a root cause of one dependency chain failure..
Oct 12 10:43:49 <mbooth>	The glassfish-el package was split into api and impl subpackages by gil
Oct 12 10:44:44 <mbooth>	So our build is using the wrong one of these (jboss version happens to be in the buildroot)

Oct 13 11:16:25 <rgrunber>	akurtakov_: hey
Oct 13 11:16:34 <akurtakov_>	have you seen lucene approvals?
Oct 13 11:16:52 <akurtakov_>	does it mean you can file ATO for lucene* ?
Oct 13 11:17:23 <rgrunber>	i never saw lucene 6 on tools-pmc.. /me looks
Oct 13 11:17:47 <akurtakov_>	not on tools
Oct 13 11:17:54 <rgrunber>	has checkin
Oct 13 11:18:01 <akurtakov_>	rgrunber: http://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12024
Oct 13 11:18:08 <akurtakov_>	http://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12060
Oct 13 11:18:14 <rgrunber>	yeah i have them

Oct 13 11:18:57 <akurtakov_>	rgrunber: so proceed for checking means ATO can be filed ?
Oct 13 11:19:14 <akurtakov_>	a bit unclear to me
Oct 13 11:19:31 <rgrunber>	yes, i think it's fine to file ATO CQs now. i would just maybe mention in the ATO that the CQ has 'checkin' status.
Oct 13 11:20:36 <akurtakov_>	in this case please do so 
Oct 13 11:20:50 <akurtakov_>	the sooner we get them in orbit the better
Oct 13 11:23:18 <rgrunber>	k, i'll file them.
Oct 13 11:30:01 <akurtakov_>	rgrunber: thanks
Oct 13 11:30:37 <akurtakov_>	rgrunber: I hope there will be clean path for Sopot to finally finish this one
Oct 13 11:30:38 <akurtakov_>	:)
Oct 13 11:30:43 <rgrunber>	i'll ask when it shows up on tools-pmc but if it would have been approved for the project itself to check in the code and distribute then i don't see why they couldn't do the same in Orbit while the approval comes..
Oct 13 12:06:52 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: what is the status of updating our version of docker-client?  I have an issue whereby the copyContainer method was deprecated and replaced by the archive method
Oct 13 12:07:21 <jjohnstn>	the 1.24 API removes the copyContainer API
Oct 13 12:08:28 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: waiting on some CQs to be approved before i can push this in.
Oct 13 12:09:04 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: what version of docker-client are you trying to get in?
Oct 13 12:09:55 <rgrunber>	3.6.8.. from there we could probably upgrade to pretty much anything.. even 6.x or whatever they're on now.
Oct 13 12:29:02 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: basically it's fine.
Oct 13 12:29:09 <rgrunber>	David responded.
Oct 13 12:33:35 <nboldt>	mbenitez: you mentioned there's an scl handoff today... how do I do that for the devstudio rpm? email a link to [someone] ?
Oct 13 12:37:34 <mbenitez>	nboldt, today's hand off is unofficial, I'd recommend checking with mbooth if it's happened already, other than that [for now] just talk to QE vkadlcik_gone does the scl side but can't remember who's the contact on the devstudio side
Oct 13 12:39:34 <nboldt>	ah, OK. vkadlcik_gone is the guy who's been QEing the rpm already so I can just let him know we have an updated version w/ new TP contents, etc.
Oct 13 12:39:59 <mbenitez>	yes, that should be fine
Oct 13 12:41:04 <nboldt>	thanks
Oct 14 09:19:36 <rgrunber>	so eclipse infra is running php < 5.4 and i got bit by https://wiki.php.net/rfc/functionarraydereferencing
Oct 14 11:05:57 <mbenitez>	mbooth, nice work with rhscl! great to see errata back in QE :)
Oct 14 11:11:48 <rgrunber>	akurtakov_: ping ?
Oct 14 11:13:16 <akurtakov_>	rgrunber: hey, what's up
Oct 14 11:13:57 <rgrunber>	akurtakov_: have you ever filed a bug against 'download.eclipse.org/tools/...' what component would it be under : Community -> ...
Oct 14 11:14:24 <rgrunber>	commiter tools, servers.. 
Oct 14 11:17:25 <rgrunber>	actually, maybe 'Servers', i did file one similar like it before..
Oct 14 11:19:36 <akurtakov_>	well, if it's download.eclipse.org/tools/ProjectA
Oct 14 11:19:43 <akurtakov_>	bug should be against ProjectA
Oct 14 11:19:53 <akurtakov_>	as projects has full control over their downloads
Oct 14 11:20:25 <rgrunber>	the bug is that i would like the web server to support a particular php module that .. say www.eclipse.org website seems to.
Oct 14 11:20:38 <akurtakov_>	ah, servers in this case definetely
Oct 14 11:20:50 <rgrunber>	yeah.. :\ debugging php has been a royal pain.
Oct 14 11:21:24 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: regarding bug https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1250859 , we fixed it in SWT would you please check whether it's in Neon.1 in scl 
Oct 14 11:37:50 <mbooth>	akurtakov_: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=1210589
Oct 14 11:37:58 <mbooth>	Menu still not very readable :-(
Oct 14 11:38:44 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: can you try with oxygen latest on the rhel7 box?
Oct 14 11:38:54 <akurtakov_>	I have managed to screw my rhel7 vm
Oct 14 11:39:01 <mbooth>	Sure, let me download it
Oct 14 11:40:07 <akurtakov_>	I hope it's not that we fixed it only for newer gtk versions
Oct 14 11:42:43 <mbooth>	FWIW I am testing on rhel 7.2 (gtk 3.14.13)
Oct 14 11:44:18 <akurtakov_>	that's good enough
Oct 14 11:44:36 <akurtakov_>	I just remember this being fixed and not seeing it on gtk 3.22 :)
Oct 14 11:46:37 <mbooth>	akurtakov_: Nope, not fixed in  N20161013-2000
Oct 14 11:46:54 <akurtakov_>	doh
Oct 14 11:51:14 <akurtakov_>	yeah https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=483097
Oct 14 11:54:01 <mbooth>	Speaking of SCL bugs, rgrunber did you see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1374634 ?
Oct 14 12:23:11 <rgrunber>	yeah i see it.
Oct 14 12:25:43 <rgrunber>	something weird happening when there's one image only.
Oct 14 12:36:15 <rgrunber>	i'll have a look to see what's wrong.

Oct 19 12:12:36 <nboldt>	mbooth: https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/pull/416 ?
Oct 19 12:13:20 <mbooth>	LGTM
Oct 19 12:14:10 <nboldt>	is usage plugin *already* in upstream?
Oct 19 12:14:34 <nboldt>	can't apply this PR until com.jboss.devstudio.core.usage.branding can resolve it from another pacakge

Oct 19 12:15:16 <nboldt>	mbooth: great, thanks. can just throw a comment in the jira saying the PR is safe to merge
Oct 19 13:24:20 <nboldt>	rgrunber: if you're wondering why rse gets dragged into devstudio installs... 
Oct 19 13:24:44 <nboldt>	look in org.jboss.ide.eclipse.as.jmx.integration.feature

Oct 19 13:25:31 <nboldt>	or org.jboss.ide.eclipse.as.rse.ui
Oct 19 13:26:22 <nboldt>	tl;dr, it's rawblem's fault
Oct 19 13:37:11 <rgrunber>	rawblem? is that Rob Stryker ?
Oct 19 14:02:33 <nboldt>	rgrunber: yes
Oct 19 16:18:45 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, looking at https://trello.com/c/GEBMEXsv/23-eclipse-upstream-migrate-orbit-project-to-using-orbit-recipes-for-3rd-party-library-contributions there are a couple of sub-tasks that can be marked complete right?
Oct 19 16:19:42 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: the first one is close but not entirely complete.
Oct 19 16:20:49 <mbenitez>	ok
Oct 19 16:21:56 <rgrunber>	i'll be generating the html page by the end of today on the nightlies .. but i'll still need to convert the old repository over as well.
Oct 19 16:23:17 <mbenitez>	sounds good, no pressure, I'm just going through the trello board
Oct 19 17:27:21 <rgrunber>	nboldt: around ?
Oct 19 17:36:39 <nboldt>	rgrunber: yep
Oct 19 17:36:49 <nboldt>	rgrunber: que pasa?
Oct 19 17:37:13 <rgrunber>	i think i know what was so fishy with that rse business.
Oct 19 17:37:47 *	nboldt listens
Oct 19 17:37:56 <rgrunber>	the reason rse/cdt and a few other packages were installed was because rpm never installed them to begin with.. so p2 just found the requirements, probably realized they weren't there, and did its job.
Oct 19 17:38:34 <rgrunber>	i mean i have tm terminal.. but no cdt...
Oct 19 17:38:51 <rgrunber>	.. or rse rpm.. so it's looking like an rpm requires is missing..
Oct 19 17:39:35 <nboldt>	you mean a missing dep from cdt -> rse rpm?
Oct 19 17:39:40 *	rgrunber tries cleaning mock and a fresh install to confirm it's still a problem..
Oct 19 17:39:43 <rgrunber>	yes
Oct 19 17:39:49 <nboldt>	should rse be in -base rpm?
Oct 19 17:39:53 <rgrunber>	sorry.. missing tm terminal -> rse/cdt
Oct 19 17:39:56 <nboldt>	since both cdt and devstudio need it?
Oct 19 17:40:26 <rgrunber>	i mean we build it https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/packageinfo?packageID=58570
Oct 19 17:40:34 <nboldt>	should tm.terminal and rse.shells.whatever.ssh.thing both be in rh-eclipse46-base?
Oct 19 17:40:39 <rgrunber>	hmmm i see what you're saying.. so the devstudio rpm doesn't require it ?
Oct 19 17:43:34 <rgrunber>	i mean we also ship tm terminal https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/packageinfo?packageID=58581
Oct 19 17:44:08 <rgrunber>	seems like a case of more duplicates but i'd confirm with mbooth tomorrow.
Oct 19 17:46:55 <rgrunber>	anyways, this is the list of things p2 installed from an update site likely due to it being missing from the rpm installation : http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/422716
Oct 19 18:03:10 <nboldt>	most of that is in the devstudio target platform
Oct 19 18:03:19 <nboldt>	just not the cdt.* bundles
Oct 19 18:03:25 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ^
Oct 19 18:04:11 <nboldt>	so, yes. there's a missing rpm dependency. I know the last time I installed devstudio from the rpm it didn't pull down the rse bundle for some reason
Oct 19 18:04:29 <nboldt>	which says to me the missing dep comes from rh-eclipse46-base
Oct 19 18:07:37 <rgrunber>	could be.
Oct 20 10:26:52 <rgrunber>	mbooth: ping (re: rh-eclipse46 base requires)
Oct 20 10:29:14 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Hallo
Oct 20 10:30:23 <rgrunber>	mbooth: those extra bundles (rse,cdt..) being installed that were unrelated might be happening because p2 finds requirements on the system that are unresolved and attempts to resolve them from update sites..
Oct 20 10:30:57 <rgrunber>	which makes sense because neither rh-eclipse46-eclipse-{rse,cdt}* were on my system. 
Oct 20 10:31:04 <mbooth>	So some missing deps from base?
Oct 20 10:31:37 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yes, maybe even related to tm-terminal.. i don't think that was on my system but the devstudio rpm has it.
Oct 20 10:32:10 <mbooth>	Is there a link to latest devstudio rpm?
Oct 20 10:32:27 <rgrunber>	hmm wonka is down..
Oct 20 10:32:40 <rgrunber>	might be dns issues on my end
Oct 20 10:33:22 <rgrunber>	mbooth: https://devstudio.jboss.com/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.rpm_master/latest/x86_64/
Oct 20 10:34:08 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yeah it definitely packages o.e.tm.terminal stuff.. so duplicates ?
Oct 20 10:37:35 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Hmm, probably -- I guess "eclipse-tm-terminal-connectors" should be pulled in by base
Oct 20 10:38:14 <mbooth>	This requires rse, remote and bits of cdt
Oct 20 10:38:54 <rgrunber>	yeah i'm gonna try an install to see.
Oct 20 10:42:02 <rgrunber>	mbooth: http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/422938 tm-terminal (non connector package) gets installed.. so no cdt,rse.
Oct 20 10:51:07 <mbooth>	rgrunber: And installing eclipse-tm-terminal-connectors before checking for updates (so that all requirements are resolved by system bundles) makes the problem go away?
Oct 20 10:52:04 *	rgrunber tries..

Oct 20 11:00:51 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yup it works.
Oct 20 11:01:05 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Okay I will file a bug for adding that package as a dep of (dist-git rules)
Oct 20 11:01:12 <rgrunber>	so the list of things installed goes from : http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/422716 .. to ..
Oct 20 11:01:15 <mbooth>	dep of base
Oct 20 11:01:31 <rgrunber>	http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/422955
Oct 20 11:02:05 <rgrunber>	(for a plugin that shouldn't be bringing in anything afaict..)
Oct 20 11:03:00 <mbooth>	javax.activation? That's part of JRE since what, java 1.5? Explicit deps on javax.activation should be killed...
Oct 20 11:03:24 <rgrunber>	also the "update time" has gone from 2 minutes to ~4sec .. i think.. but now i have no idea whether its because i shortened the list of plugins being pointlessly installed or because i disabled uses!! :(
Oct 20 11:05:45 <mbooth>	I would guess "javax.servlet" is due to some requires-bundle on javax.servlet because the bsn for the version we use is different. Upstream should import-package javax.servlet instead (I recall filing a bug upstream but I guess it did not get into this devstudio release)
Oct 20 11:06:11 <rgrunber>	mbooth: it must be coming from some requires in devstudio then ?.. and it's probably in the update site somewhere.. for neon ..
Oct 20 11:07:42 <mbooth>	rgrunber: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4055
Oct 20 11:08:18 <rgrunber>	ah..
Oct 20 11:08:42 <mbooth>	But devstudio rpm is 10.2, so maybe the fix is in? Let me see
Oct 20 11:09:16 <rgrunber>	o.e.jst.ws.jaxws.core, o.jboss.tools.ws.ui,o.e.wst.ws_core.feature.feature.group, o.glassfish.jersey.core.jersey-common all seem to require javax.activation.
Oct 20 11:10:43 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Which is unnecessary considering Eclipse requires java 1.8 these days
Oct 20 11:10:52 <mbooth>	Probably just old cruft
Oct 20 11:12:10 <mbooth>	Wait do they import-package or require-bundle javax.activation? The former is probably okay since the jre provides that package
Oct 20 11:12:25 <rgrunber>	i think one was require.. one sec..
Oct 20 11:12:55 <rgrunber>	everything requirs package javax.activation except :
Oct 20 11:12:55 <rgrunber>	IU: org.eclipse.wst.ws_core.feature.feature.group 3.7.0.v201505131719
Oct 20 11:12:56 <rgrunber>	-> javax.activation [1.1.0.v201211130549]
Oct 20 11:13:25 *	mbooth shakes fist at webtools
Oct 20 11:15:58 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I don't see it in: /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/eclipse/droplets/webtools-javaee/eclipse/features/org.eclipse.wst.ws_core.feature_3.7.0.v201610121400/feature.xml
Oct 20 11:16:32 <rgrunber>	yeah me neither.. weird..
Oct 20 11:17:00 <mbooth>	rgrunber: In fact: http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/rpms/eclipse-webtools/tree/eclipse-webtools.spec?h=rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7#n412
Oct 20 11:17:08 <mbooth>	We remove that dep before building
Oct 20 11:17:57 <rgrunber>	ok let me try some more thorough examining.. i was querying http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/pde.source.lookup/all/repo/ hoping the content was probably the same-ish..
Oct 20 11:21:51 <rgrunber>	mbooth: only other thing that stands out is everything requires package javax.activatio 0.0.0, except javax.mail which requires it at [1.1.0,1.2.0)
Oct 20 11:23:38 <rgrunber>	opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/eclipse/droplets/devstudio/eclipse/plugins/javax.mail_1.4.0.v201005080615.jar
Oct 20 11:35:39 <mbooth>	rgrunber: javax.mail from RPM seems to have versionless import of javax.activation (there is no RPM version of javax.activation) -- this differs of course from the orbit version of javax.mail :-)
Oct 20 11:36:32 <rgrunber>	heh.. also 1.5 and 1.4 are both there.
Oct 20 11:36:41 <rgrunber>	(rpm) and (orbit)
Oct 20 11:37:30 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Maybe short term fix is to not blacklist javax.activation here: https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/devstudio.blacklist.txt
Oct 20 11:38:40 <rgrunber>	yeah, i don't even know if both are needed..
Oct 20 11:38:44 <rgrunber>	(javax.mail)
Oct 20 11:38:56 <mbooth>	Since devstudio rpm contains the orbit version of javax.mail (I guess no other rpm package has a javax.mail symlink...)

Oct 21 10:43:23 <mistria>	scela akurtakov: I'll arrive at Ludwigsburg around midnight in the night between sunday and monday
Oct 21 10:43:38 <mistria>	scela akurtakov: so no dinner there for me
Oct 21 11:00:03 <akurtakov>	mistria: ok
Oct 21 11:00:22 <akurtakov>	so I need to coordinate with Jeff only for sunday :)
Oct 21 11:36:26 <nboldt>	rgrunber: mbooth_: so... looks like quorum decision is to just leave vpe in devstudio rpm. :( 
Oct 21 11:36:42 <nboldt>	which means we drag in xulrunner deps and it won't even really work OOTB
Oct 21 11:37:29 <mbooth_>	Boo hiss
Oct 21 11:45:22 <nboldt>	did rh-eclipse46* recently move to a newer version of com.google.guava?
Oct 21 11:45:39 <nboldt>	trying to figure out why we have https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4131 all o' a suddeb
Oct 21 11:45:47 <nboldt>	s/suddeb/sudden
Oct 21 11:46:19 <nboldt>	more importantly, where can I look up this information so I don't have to lazygoogle it from you guys? mbooth_ rgrunber ?
Oct 21 11:46:59 <rgrunber>	a bunch of stuff probably uses guava 18
Oct 21 11:47:06 <nboldt>	*grumble*
Oct 21 11:47:12 <mbooth_>	No guava did not change on our side
Oct 21 11:47:24 <nboldt>	yes, it's in 6 different droplets
Oct 21 11:47:35 <nboldt>	rgrunber: details in the above JIRA
Oct 21 11:47:47 <mbooth_>	Did it get added to blacklisted so that the only available version is the rpm supplied one?
Oct 21 11:47:49 <nboldt>	want me to open some RH bugzillae complaining about that?
Oct 21 11:47:59 <rgrunber>	we probably have latest guava i rh-java-common or wherever..
Oct 21 11:48:01 <nboldt>	prolly yes
Oct 21 11:48:39 <nboldt>	yep. https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/devstudio.blacklist.txt#L71-L73
Oct 21 11:48:53 <nboldt>	but when I added it, it was 15.0
Oct 21 11:49:01 <rgrunber>	ah that would be me
Oct 21 11:49:30 <nboldt>	correction, when rgrunber submitted PR to remove it, https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/commit/c57e4b292195361033c8546ff023feb0715037ca it was 15.0 in the comments
Oct 21 11:49:32 <rgrunber>	feel free to undo it.. i guess i tried to remove all duplicates but we can free those up
Oct 21 11:49:35 <nboldt>	that was 23 days ago
Oct 21 11:50:12 <nboldt>	I hope com.goog.guav isn't a singleton
Oct 21 11:51:08 <rgrunber>	nahhh ..
Oct 21 11:52:26 <rgrunber>	i didn't blacklist only singletons.. a few libraries where i figured the base rpm stack should have it.. i guess we only have guava 18 though.
Oct 21 11:52:53 <nboldt>	maybe there's a newer o.e.m2e ?
Oct 21 11:53:50 <nboldt>	hmm. 1.7.0 is latest from Neon.0
Oct 21 11:54:04 <nboldt>	but there's milestone for 1.8.0 in progress ... prolly for Oxygen?
Oct 21 11:56:05 <fbricon>	@nboldt tadaaa
Oct 21 11:56:13 <nboldt>	fbricon: welcome!
Oct 21 11:56:49 <nboldt>	so... the o.e.m2e milestones I found http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/milestones/1.8/ appear to align with Oxygen M1 and M2 dates
Oct 21 11:57:00 <nboldt>	which means not a solution for devstudio 10.2 :(
Oct 21 11:57:42 <nboldt>	so ... I can try adding a second version of guava into the devstudio rpm (the older 15.0 stuff) and having Eclipse just deal with two versions at startup (15 + 18)
Oct 21 11:58:56 <rgrunber>	i think that should be ok.. i mean osgi ought to be able to deal with multiple versions of same bundle.
Oct 21 11:59:05 <nboldt>	and looks like the latest m2e.core jar org.eclipse.m2e.core_1.8.0.20160921-2002.jar requires the same version of guava... com.google.guava;bundle-version="[14.0.1,16.0.0)"
Oct 21 11:59:11 <nboldt>	so we'll have this problem in Oxygen too :(
Oct 21 11:59:42 <nboldt>	yeah, it's just I don't like bloat where I can avoid it. and this might pull in MORE dupes and cause MORE slow startup time :(
Oct 21 12:01:35 <fbricon>	nboldt: that's weird. I opened m2e-core in oxygen and it works
Oct 21 12:01:57 <nboldt>	fbricon: yes, but you're probably not running the devstudio rpm
Oct 21 12:02:07 <nboldt>	fbricon: context: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4131
Oct 21 12:02:41 <nboldt>	rgrunber: where would I open a RH BZ for moving guava 18.0 out of 7 droplets and into a single shared location?
Oct 21 12:02:49 <nboldt>	rgrunber: or have you opened that already?
Oct 21 12:03:05 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i don't think it's a duplicate.. it's likely a symlink.
Oct 21 12:04:04 <rgrunber>	that points to /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/java/guava.jar or something
Oct 21 12:04:09 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ah, good call
Oct 21 12:04:18 <nboldt>	com.google.guava_18.0.0.jar -> ../../../../../java/guava.jar
Oct 21 12:04:45 <nboldt>	so no harm no foul, just a misleading `find` 
Oct 21 12:04:59 <rgrunber>	it *could* be possible to bundle guava (a library) as a droplet.. and then that'd avoid the symlinks.. but it's an interesting idea that we don't really do yet since i don't think the duplicate symlinks causes much overhead.
Oct 21 12:06:18 <rgrunber>	those droplets are able to coexist individually without the others so each symlink needs to exist or risk being broken.. but if they all depended on some 'guava droplet' a requires would be sufficient.. again not really a high priority issue given duplicate symlinks are ok.
Oct 21 12:07:56 <nboldt>	rgrunber: true but I've heard at least twice in Wed meetings something about "bad symlink in rpm, which we fixed..."
Oct 21 12:08:06 <nboldt>	so it's not a unique pain
Oct 21 12:08:26 <nboldt>	might be time to at least LOG the jira/bz so it's on the radar as something to fix on a rainy day?
Oct 21 12:08:39 <rgrunber>	if underlying rpm containing library changes location, then symlinks break and rebuild is required ?
Oct 21 12:10:36 <fbricon>	nboldt: changing the guava req for m2e would be for neon or oxygen?
Oct 21 12:16:55 <nboldt>	fbricon: neon if you wanted to do a 0.17.1, oxygen if for 0.18.0
Oct 21 12:17:42 <nboldt>	rgrunber: yes, I believe that's what I heard from lufimtse (?) 
Oct 21 12:17:54 <nboldt>	can't recall who was talking about it ... maybe 3 weeks ago?
Oct 21 12:17:59 <fbricon>	oxygen is doable. Neon I'm not too excited
Oct 21 12:18:15 <lufimtse>	hey
Oct 21 12:18:56 <lufimtse>	nboldt, what goes?
Oct 21 12:24:44 <nboldt>	lufimtse: just trying to remember who on a Wed call was talking recently about problems in rpms with symlinks to upstream/shared jars, when those jars are moved/renamed and the symlinks break.
Oct 21 12:24:56 <nboldt>	maybe in cdt? linuxtools? swt?
Oct 21 12:26:14 <lufimtse>	hmm, not me. I haven't worked much with RPM's yet.
Oct 21 12:30:03 <nboldt>	ah, ok. guess it wasn't you then *shurg*
Oct 21 12:30:11 <nboldt>	s/shurg/shrug
Oct 21 12:30:14 <nboldt>	lufimtse: ^
Oct 21 12:51:25 <nboldt>	akazakov: did you head back from mbooth about how to test the new usage tracking in rh-eclipse46* ?
Oct 21 13:03:38 <akazakov>	nboldt, I got a message that it's done. But I want to see the source code.
Oct 21 13:04:06 <nboldt>	akazakov: ok, me too :D
Oct 21 13:09:48 <rgrunber>	nboldt: ah, i think that would be me..
Oct 21 13:11:01 <rgrunber>	nboldt: so it was in the context of jackson-datatype-collections or something.. a bundle was moved into another rpm and it's location on the system changed.. requiring a rebuild of the plugin that used it.
Oct 21 13:11:49 <rgrunber>	this is still not a common occurence.. for a bundle's location to change like that.
Oct 21 13:28:11 <nboldt>	rgrunber: oic
Oct 21 13:28:34 <nboldt>	rgrunber: any one know who's doing any work (if any) with Eclipse and JDK 9?
Oct 21 13:28:52 <nboldt>	asking because https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22417 still hosed
Oct 21 13:31:43 <rgrunber>	nboldt: https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.6/platform.php#java-9

Oct 24 12:23:23 <nboldt>	freemarker.noarch or rh-eclipse46-freemarker.noarch
Oct 24 12:24:00 <nboldt>	once I install rh-eclipse46-freemarker.noarch the symlink is blue (instead of red/broken(
Oct 24 12:27:52 <nboldt>	want a bugzilla for this? rgrunber ?
Oct 24 12:37:13 <rgrunber>	hmm iirc there was one bug about this.. i think.. one sec.
Oct 24 12:37:44 <rgrunber>	actually this is a known bug.. the symlink is broken but its functionality isn't needed.
Oct 24 12:38:12 <rgrunber>	i believe it's cdt-arduino that needs freemarker, cdt itself does not.
Oct 24 12:38:34 <nboldt>	well, it causes an error on startup of devstudio

Oct 24 12:40:07 <nboldt>	so... since cdt requires it and devstudio requires cdt, therefore devstudio rpm spec now includes a requirement on it too :(
Oct 24 12:40:36 <nboldt>	https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/commit/1719d8b7e6f2ff522a7215367a3cef98b828fff6
Oct 24 12:41:59 <rgrunber>	ok this is weird.. https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/rpminfo?rpmID=4433760 we don't ship arduino in rh-eclipse46.. and cdt main requires freemarker..
Oct 24 12:42:39 <rgrunber>	under Requires: .. rh-eclipse46-osgi(org.freemarker.freemarker)
Oct 24 12:42:49 <nboldt>	curiously, rh-eclipse46-eclipse-tm-terminal-connectors requires rh-eclipse46-freemarker, but it wasn't installed when I installed devstudio.
Oct 24 12:45:22 <nboldt>	yeah so if you do: yum install rh-eclipse46-eclipse-tm-terminal-connectors it lists rh-eclipse46-freemarker as a requirement
Oct 24 12:45:38 <nboldt>	but then if you do yum install rh-eclipse46-devstudio it skips over that requirement
Oct 24 12:46:59 <rgrunber>	i don't believe tm-terminal-connectors gets installed with devstudio... only tm-terminal did last i tried.
Oct 24 12:47:06 <nboldt>	yeah, I'm adding it
Oct 24 12:47:44 <nboldt>	and since rh-eclipse46-cdt and rh-eclipse46-tm-terminal-connectors BOTH appear to depend on rh-eclipse46-freemarker... it's a bit wack that it doesn't get installed 
Oct 24 12:48:10 <nboldt>	but hey, when in doubt, list deps explicitly instead of assuming software can navigate the tree of deps for you
Oct 24 12:48:28 <nboldt>	thus, I've added freemarker dep explicitly into the devstudio.spec
Oct 24 12:49:04 <rgrunber>	i can take a look.. wasjust temporarily busy with some tycho p2 mirror stuff.. trying to combine 2 repos into a zip.
Oct 24 12:49:43 <nboldt>	one easy way is to just put each repo as a folder inside the zip and then add composite*.xml files to the root of the zip
Oct 24 12:49:47 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ^
Oct 24 12:52:26 <rgrunber>	yeah that could work. one of the repos is remote so it needs to be mirrored locally so i can generate a zip of everything.
Oct 24 12:53:07 <nboldt>	does the remote repo exist as a zip too? curling a zip is faster than mirroring via p2
Oct 24 12:53:16 <nboldt>	but that assumes you need the whole repo
Oct 24 12:55:06 <rgrunber>	the thing is.. i want to create one giant self-contained zip where the metadata/artifact repos list everything.
Oct 24 12:55:59 <rgrunber>	orbit builds product both a remote repo (now a composite) to use but we gave users the option to download a zip of everything so trying to preserve that.
Oct 24 13:01:42 <nboldt>	everything being sources and plugins alike?
Oct 24 13:02:33 <nboldt>	creation of the remote repo (unpacked update site) should also produce a zip at the same time if you[re using tycho
Oct 24 13:03:55 <rgrunber>	yes i have a zip for the individual repos as well so i'm basically running p2mirror only to "merge the p2 metadata"
Oct 24 13:05:06 <rgrunber>	i'm not sure how much it matters whether it be a single local repo.. otherwise your approach of creating a composite from those is nicer.
Oct 24 13:38:55 <nboldt>	rgrunber: yeah, merged metadata is probably more efficient than having a series of nested folders in the zip
Oct 24 13:40:46 <rgrunber>	slight disadvantage is the mirror goal still tries to resolve everything.. and if it fails, just skips it afaict.
Oct 24 14:03:50 <rgrunber>	nboldt: well i'm pretty confused now.
Oct 24 14:04:07 <rgrunber>	nboldt: no freemarker being installed... yet i clearly see it as a require in the rpm... what's satisfying it..
Oct 24 14:04:26 <nboldt>	no idea, man

Oct 24 14:14:17 <nboldt>	./share/eclipse/droplets/cdt/eclipse/plugins/org.freemarker.freemarker_2.3.23.jar
Oct 24 14:14:32 <nboldt>	./share/eclipse/droplets/devstudio/eclipse/plugins/org.jboss.tools.forge.runtime_2.0.102.v20161003-1654/addon-repository/org-jboss-forge-addon-templates-3-3-2-Final/freemarker-2.3.20.jar
Oct 24 14:14:39 <rgrunber>	yeah probably that.
Oct 24 14:15:05 <nboldt>	o.f.f in cdt depends on f.jar in shared libs
Oct 24 14:15:27 <rgrunber>	basically freemarker symlink isn't getting resolved because it's expecting it to come from the rh-eclipse46-freemarker location
Oct 24 14:15:36 <nboldt>	I see
Oct 24 14:15:40 <nboldt>	so that's wrong :(
Oct 24 14:15:43 <rgrunber>	but devstudio provides it
Oct 24 14:15:59 <nboldt>	well, not exactly
Oct 24 14:16:27 <nboldt>	sticking it inside a hibernate jar buried inside a droplet folder won't make it available for other plugins to resolve
Oct 24 14:16:48 <nboldt>	plus it's an old version
Oct 24 14:21:57 <rgrunber>	yeah so i guess if it's possible to either symlink that jar to the actual location that we'll use..
Oct 24 14:22:37 <rgrunber>	depending on wehther there's a bundle-classpath on it or not..
Oct 24 14:44:30 *	scox is away: hospital
Oct 24 16:37:04 <nboldt>	rgrunber: if I wanted to create a symlink from within devstudio rpm install to something like /usr/share/java/lucene3/lucene-core-3.jar ... what's the  syntax in specfile?
Oct 24 16:38:06 <nboldt>	i guess it's something like this? https://www.redhat.com/archives/rpm-list/2005-July/msg00125.html (but in %install not in %post)
Oct 24 16:39:59 <rgrunber>	yeah, in %install you'd just do an ln -s ${_javadir}/lucene3/lucene-core-3.jar %{buildroot}/path/to/symlink
Oct 24 16:41:00 <rgrunber>	%{_root_datadir}/java/lucene3/lucene-core-3.jar .. assuming that it is in fact located in the base system location and not some scl root.

Oct 25 10:52:25 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, is there a way to manually clone the jira issue to BZ?
Oct 25 10:53:40 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: you mean manually copying and pasting? yep, you can manually copy and paste :D
Oct 25 10:53:52 <mbenitez>	haha fair enough
Oct 25 10:54:06 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: or just open a new issue with minimal content, and use an Issue Link to simply link to the upstream one
Oct 25 10:54:33 <nboldt1>	eg., https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4136 has 3 upstream links
Oct 25 10:54:36 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, mind doing that for the rh-java-common one please?
Oct 25 10:55:01 <nboldt1>	you mean link the RH BZ to the JBDS JIRA? Already done
Oct 25 10:55:30 <nboldt1>	for reference, issue links are in Jira under the More button > Link 
Oct 25 10:55:45 <nboldt1>	if it's not a JIRA link, then use the "Web Link" option to link to any other tracker
Oct 25 10:56:10 <mbenitez>	ok, had not seen it in my search
Oct 25 10:56:12 <nboldt1>	otherwise it tries to resolve https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1388513 as if it's a JIRA ID, which doesn't work very well
Oct 25 10:56:52 <nboldt1>	mistria: any topics for http://jbds-pm.etherpad.corp.redhat.com/build-next ?
Oct 25 10:57:02 <mistria>	nboldt1: nope
Oct 25 10:57:17 <mistria>	nboldt: and since I'm at EclispeCon, I won't attend anyway ;)
Oct 25 10:57:48 <nboldt1>	mistria: oh, right. forgot you were afk this week
Oct 25 10:59:18 <mistria>	nboldt1: no pb. and I'm not that ffk (far from keyboard)
Oct 25 11:06:02 <nboldt1>	mistria: I expect you're travelling around the con w/ keyboard in hand :D
Oct 25 11:15:33 <mbenitez>	mbooth, fyi I emailed the contact mentioned in  BZ about bouncycastle to make sure he was aware of the issues
Oct 25 11:34:02 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Do you mind if I close EL6-specific bugs for Eclipse SCL? It should be safe to, now that we definitely definitely are an EL7-only collection, right?
Oct 25 11:34:50 <mbenitez>	mbooth, not at all, I was thinking about that last week, please go ahead
Oct 25 11:34:55 <nboldt1>	mbooth:  can you link to your patch/source/whatever in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4014 please?
Oct 25 11:35:02 <mbooth>	Cool, thanks
Oct 25 11:35:17 *	nboldt1 wants to learn where stuff is/exists
Oct 25 11:35:33 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Sure -- though it is going to change now of course :-)
Oct 25 11:35:56 <nboldt1>	yeah, understood
Oct 25 11:36:11 <nboldt1>	but I think akazakov wants to be able to see it 
Oct 25 11:40:01 <akazakov>	yep
Oct 25 12:09:25 <akazakov>	mbooth are you using some different sources of the usage plugin? Not from github repo?
Oct 25 12:10:01 <akazakov>	I wonder why these changes are not in github but in the fedora patch only
Oct 25 12:10:50 <mbooth>	akazakov: No, source is jbosstools-4.4.1.Final tag from github + patch
Oct 25 12:14:37 <akazakov>	mbooth, ok, but why not to change it in github directly?
Oct 25 12:15:15 <akazakov>	you have to use 4.4.1.Final ?
Oct 25 12:20:37 <mbooth>	akazakov: Well, even though it's functionally no different to use tarball from my own github fork, I am not the canonical source for the upstream project
Oct 25 12:20:55 <akazakov>	mbooth, nboldt I see that we include usage in devstudio rpm
Oct 25 12:21:27 <nboldt>	akazakov: yes, and in JBDS-4014 I said I was waiting until it was in rh-eclipse46-base to remove it from devstudio rpm spec
Oct 25 12:21:56 <nboldt>	but if you want me to remove it now and break more things that depend on it (there are many) I can do that :D
Oct 25 12:21:58 <akazakov>	but base will have 4.4.1.Final + this patch instead
Oct 25 12:22:14 <akazakov>	not 4.4.2
Oct 25 12:22:36 <nboldt>	wait, what?
Oct 25 12:22:44 <nboldt>	4.4.1.Final of what?
Oct 25 12:22:52 <akazakov>	the usage plugin
Oct 25 12:23:00 <akazakov>	http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/eclipse-usage.git/tree/rpm-usage.patch
Oct 25 12:23:05 <mbooth>	akazakov: I'm not sure what you mean? Is the devstudio rpm not shipping 4.4.1 of base?
Oct 25 12:23:13 <akazakov>	not
Oct 25 12:23:21 <akazakov>	it's shipping 4.4.2
Oct 25 12:23:31 <akazakov>	which is under development
Oct 25 12:23:41 <akazakov>	it's part of devstudio
Oct 25 12:23:59 <nboldt>	are you sure you don't mean 4.4.1 (Neon.1) ?
Oct 25 12:25:22 <nboldt>	oh, I see we did bump usage up to .2
Oct 25 12:25:26 <nboldt>	but it's 2.2.2
Oct 25 12:25:52 <akazakov>	i'm positive. nboldt we are working on releasing base 4.4.2 :)
Oct 25 12:26:27 <nboldt>	well, yes, base 4.4.2 but the plugin is 2.0.0. https://github.com/nickboldt/jbosstools-base/blob/master/usage/plugins/org.jboss.tools.usage/pom.xml#L8
Oct 25 12:26:44 <nboldt>	not sure where I saw 2.2.2... sorry
Oct 25 12:28:11 <akazakov>	nboldt, because this is your fork
Oct 25 12:28:20 <akazakov>	https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-base/blob/master/usage/plugins/org.jboss.tools.usage/pom.xml is the correct url
Oct 25 12:29:22 <akazakov>	mbooth, do you have to use something stable to use in eclipse-base? So you can't use devstudio part which we are going to release in one month?
Oct 25 12:30:12 <akazakov>	if so, then what if we just use 4.4.1.Final + patch for usage in eclipse-base but also include 4.4.2 in devstudio?
Oct 25 12:30:24 <akazakov>	so both plugins will be present if devstudio installed
Oct 25 12:30:30 <akazakov>	but the latest one will be loaded
Oct 25 12:30:38 <nboldt>	ah, right. oops. need moar cawfee
Oct 25 12:30:41 <akazakov>	nboldt, mbooth will it work?
Oct 25 12:32:28 <mbooth>	akazakov: If older one does not get loaded there is no point in it being there ;-)
Oct 25 12:32:42 <nboldt>	if you patch 2.2.1 and include 2.2.2 in the installed footprint, 2.2.2 will be loaded because that's how osgi rolls
Oct 25 12:33:32 <nboldt>	but considering the staggering changes that have happened between 2.2.1 and 2.2.2... https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-base/commits/master/usage/plugins/org.jboss.tools.usage
Oct 25 12:33:47 <nboldt>	I'm going to go ahead and say we'll be OK to just remove 2.2.2 and fall back on 2.2.1
Oct 25 12:34:35 <mbooth>	akazakov: I can package newer snapshot if you want, but nboldt makes a compelling point :-)
Oct 25 12:35:06 <nboldt>	in fact one could argue that we shouldn't have even upversioned the plugin because nothing changed in it and you're violating the jgit timestamp benefits by committing changes that do nothing
Oct 25 12:35:52 <akazakov>	so usage is not used by other plugins in dts?
Oct 25 12:35:57 <nboldt>	only thing we did in the whole jbosstools-base/usage tree since 4.4.1.Final was to fix some tests
Oct 25 12:36:03 <akazakov>	I thought we are going to use it 
Oct 25 12:36:07 <akazakov>	not only in devstudio
Oct 25 12:36:35 <akazakov>	so if devstudio is not used then 4.4.1.Fnail +patch is used
Oct 25 12:36:51 <akazakov>	if installed then 4.4.2 will be used
Oct 25 12:37:48 <akazakov>	but anyway, what ever we use, we need this change in github master
Oct 25 12:37:51 <akazakov>	not only in the patch
Oct 25 12:40:09 <nboldt>	can't this patch just be applied in jbosstools-base/usage, rather than being an rpm-only patch?
Oct 25 12:40:24 <akazakov>	it should
Oct 25 12:40:41 <nboldt>	then all that rh-eclipse46-base needs to do is include the compiled plugin
Oct 25 12:41:09 <nboldt>	and if there's a dupe version in base and in devstudio, I remove the one in devstudio and replace with symlink (or remove it entirely)
Oct 25 12:41:45 <akazakov>	are we using the usage plugin in eclipse-base or not?
Oct 25 12:41:57 <nboldt>	currently not
Oct 25 12:42:01 <nboldt>	because steps were:
Oct 25 12:42:07 <nboldt>	a) apply patch
Oct 25 12:42:09 <nboldt>	b) build it
Oct 25 12:42:21 <nboldt>	c) get it into rh-eclipse46-base [somehow]
Oct 25 12:43:00 <nboldt>	and we've only done step a-1) which is 'create a patch' and a-2) get it reviewed (about 3 hrs ago)
Oct 25 12:43:27 <nboldt>	so... unless there's a reason to not apply mat's patch in jbosstools-base, it should go there
Oct 25 12:43:39 <nboldt>	and we can build it as part of the jbosstools-base CI job
Oct 25 12:44:03 <nboldt>	then [packaging magic for rh-eclipse46-base] can happen to rebuild it from source and include it in *-base
Oct 25 12:44:17 <nboldt>	and when THAT is done, I can remove it from devstudio.spec file
Oct 25 12:45:07 <akazakov>	but why do we want to have usage installed as part of ecipse-base instead of devstduio?
Oct 25 12:45:25 <nboldt>	so that its magic can happen for rh-eclipse46 (the cdt stuff)
Oct 25 12:45:33 <akazakov>	I thought you guys wanted to track pure base or ds installations
Oct 25 12:45:54 <akazakov>	I'm OK to keep it in devstudio only because I want to track devstudio
Oct 25 12:46:03 <nboldt>	if we don't want it to work for eclipse, eclipse-cdt, AND devstudio then we might as well just fix it in the downstream jbosstools-base/usage/plugins/ and be done
Oct 25 12:46:21 <nboldt>	well, that's not the original design but *shrug emoji*
Oct 25 12:46:23 <mbooth>	akazakov: It has to be installed by RPM otherwise we cannot detect SCL (CDT and friends) installations
Oct 25 12:47:17 <akazakov>	mbooth, so you are planing to start using it in SCL too?
Oct 25 12:47:39 <akazakov>	you are not using it because it's not included yet but you are plannig to do so, correct?
Oct 25 12:47:51 <mbooth>	akazakov: It already reports startups of the product with no changes at all on our side
Oct 25 12:48:21 <mbooth>	akazakov: We have no plans right now to do anything more detailed
Oct 25 12:48:42 <akazakov>	ok, startups is enough for you. got it
Oct 25 12:49:35 <akazakov>	mbooth, nboldt so I suggest apply mbooth's patch (the new one we discussed today) and apply this patch on master in github as well
Oct 25 12:50:05 <nboldt>	akazakov: love to but I don't have push rights in jbosstools-base :D
Oct 25 12:50:33 <nboldt>	nor do I have any idea where to apply it in the scl code
Oct 25 12:50:41 <akazakov>	and let's include it in devstudio too. So if we change something in usage in the following weeks we will have it in devstudio rpm
Oct 25 12:50:56 <mbooth>	I will submit PR when I made the changes akazakov asked for
Oct 25 12:51:00 <akazakov>	nboldt, I would expect mbooth creating a PR against master
Oct 25 12:51:26 <nboldt>	akazakov: so I should NOT remove it from devstudio as proposed in https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/pull/416/files a week ago?
Oct 25 12:51:54 <akazakov>	nboldt, no you should not. Unless I'm missing something 
Oct 25 12:52:14 <mbooth>	nboldt: You should remove it, otherwise duplicated bundles
Oct 25 12:52:29 <akazakov>	and the latest one will be loaded, wont' it?
Oct 25 12:52:42 <akazakov>	4.4.2 instead of 4.4.1
Oct 25 12:52:48 <nboldt>	yes but there's more reconciler work to be done on startup
Oct 25 12:53:18 <nboldt>	I'm so confused why you think it'd be 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 when the source code from which Mat is building is patch is 2.2.2
Oct 25 12:53:50 <mbooth>	nboldt: It's the version in the release tag  
Oct 25 12:53:56 <akazakov>	which is 4.4.1
Oct 25 12:54:01 <nboldt>	oic, it's called 4.4.1 in http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/eclipse-usage.git/tree/eclipse-usage.spec
Oct 25 12:54:01 <akazakov>	4.4.1.Final
Oct 25 12:54:07 <nboldt>	that's hella wrong
Oct 25 12:54:18 <nboldt>	it should be 2.2.2 so it aligns with the source tree
Oct 25 12:54:20 <nboldt>	in github
Oct 25 12:54:52 <mbooth>	nboldt: Hey, I'm not in charge of tagging JBT releases :-p
Oct 25 12:55:04 <mbooth>	I use whatever version upstream uses
Oct 25 12:55:22 <nboldt>	oh, I see what you did ... you're including teh whole stack of deps not just the single plugin
Oct 25 12:55:23 <akazakov>	ok. if we want to avoid reconciling then we can actually update our master in github and include it in eclise-base without any patches
Oct 25 12:55:48 <akazakov>	and treat the usage 4.4.2 plugin frozen
Oct 25 12:56:40 <akazakov>	mbooth, we are working on releasing 4.4.2 so we do not have any 4.4.2 tag yet
Oct 25 12:57:41 <mbooth>	akazakov: I think you are worrying over nothing -- the code will eventually be upstream, it will be the same as what is shipped in the SCL "base"
Oct 25 13:00:20 <akazakov>	mbooth, we are for example working on replacing the Google Anylitics URL where we report the usage date to some new RH service for 4.4.2. We probably won't have time to do it but it may happen
Oct 25 13:00:53 <mbooth>	akazakov: Which is fine. This versioning issue is a "red-herring" -- whatever version it is, we still have to ship it as RPM in order for it to still be present when devstudio is not installed
Oct 25 13:02:14 <akazakov>	mbooth, what happen if we update our usage let say in two weeks?
Oct 25 13:02:21 <akazakov>	to include the new URL
Oct 25 13:03:36 <mbooth>	akazakov: Then we need ship an updated RPM -- but you guys upstream have the same problem, right? Not all your users are going to update immediately and at the same time...
Oct 25 13:04:42 <nboldt>	akazakov: why can't we just change the URL now? do we know what the new one should be? is it a secret? Is Google updating Analytics again to break old URLs?
Oct 25 13:04:55 <akazakov>	nboldt, we don't have any yet
Oct 25 13:05:24 <akazakov>	and probably won't have it by the time of 10.2 release
Oct 25 13:06:36 <nboldt>	well, there's a 10.3 coming in just a few months
Oct 25 13:07:07 <nboldt>	or we fix this later (as we had been discussing doing for slf4j.api jar) as an off-release patch fix
Oct 25 13:08:32 <akazakov>	mbooth, nboldt so are you suggesting to keep usage 4.4.1.Final + patch in eclipse-base and remove usage from devstudio? Then if we need update usage we will work on updating base-rpm?
Oct 25 13:09:37 <nboldt>	akazakov: I'm suggesting that since you don't have a fix for either rh-eclipse46-base OR for devstudio installer/site OR for devstudio rpm that we focus on what we CAN solve now
Oct 25 13:09:48 <mbooth>	akazakov: We will *always* need to update the RPM if we need to update the usage plugin -- don't forget we still want it to work for the SCL
Oct 25 13:09:58 <nboldt>	which is to get the plugin w/ mbooth's changes into rh-eclipse46-base
Oct 25 13:10:05 <nboldt>	and push teh same patch to jbosstools-base
Oct 25 13:10:34 <nboldt>	and then I can remove the duplicate usage plugin (v2.2.2) from devstudio if we decide we don't like having dupes for no good reason (which was the plan last week)
Oct 25 13:11:48 <akazakov>	we will push these changes to github master anyway. But what you want to include in eclipse-base? 4.4.1.Final + patch?
Oct 25 13:12:20 <akazakov>	or 2.2.2 from master?
Oct 25 13:12:29 <akazakov>	4.2.2 I mean
Oct 25 13:13:00 <mbooth>	akazakov: When the patch is upstream we can use an upstream snapshot, sure -- either way we are shipping identical bytecode ;-)
Oct 25 13:13:30 <nboldt>	hoorah for "it's not patched, it's just the same as the code in jbosstools-base github"
Oct 25 13:14:00 <akazakov>	i'm confused. 
Oct 25 13:14:51 <akazakov>	nboldt, you are talking about 1. Updating master, 2. Include it to eclipse-base. mbooth you are taling about creating patches
Oct 25 13:15:04 <akazakov>	or I got you both wrong?
Oct 25 13:15:12 <nboldt>	patch = PR = same thing
Oct 25 13:15:31 <mbooth>	akazakov: I mean there is literally no difference between 4.4.1 + unmerged patch and 4.4.2 + merged patch
Oct 25 13:16:05 <nboldt>	+1
Oct 25 13:16:07 <akazakov>	the only differnce is in the plugin version
Oct 25 13:16:38 <akazakov>	but it's Ok. I just want to know what we will do? 4.4.1 + unmerged patch or 4.4.2 + merged
Oct 25 13:16:54 <akazakov>	binaries almost the same
Oct 25 13:19:08 <mbooth>	akazakov: Since there is no difference other than version number, I wasn't going to elect to do extra work for no benefit ;-)
Oct 25 13:19:29 <akazakov>	mbooth, so 4.4.1 + unmerged patch then?
Oct 25 13:19:42 <mbooth>	Yes
Oct 25 13:20:10 <akazakov>	ok
Oct 25 13:20:37 <akazakov>	don't forget to crate a PR for master when you are done with the new patch ;)
Oct 25 13:20:54 <akazakov>	s/crate/create 
Oct 25 13:20:58 <mbooth>	Of course :-)
Oct 25 14:34:50 <scela>	rgrunber: hey
Oct 25 14:34:57 <rgrunber>	scela: hey
Oct 25 14:35:03 <scela>	rgrunber: i noticed your gerrit with the lucene
Oct 25 14:35:15 <scela>	rgrunber: i'll try to find it though it's pretty intensive here at eclipsecon :)
Oct 25 14:35:18 <rgrunber>	yeah i added you just now.. no rush though.. probaby busy with eclipsecon
Oct 25 14:35:26 <scela>	s/find it/find time for it/
Oct 25 14:35:44 <rgrunber>	worst case : i'll push it in at the latest opportunity.. which would be end of next week or something ?
Oct 25 14:36:08 <scela>	rgrunber: i should definitely be able to get back to you before that
Oct 25 14:36:21 <scela>	rgrunber: monday i'm working as normal and that's the first thing on my pipeline
Oct 25 14:36:28 <rgrunber>	scela: have you seen Jeff ?
Oct 25 14:36:32 <scela>	rgrunber: yes
Oct 25 14:36:40 <scela>	rgrunber: miss him already ;)
Oct 25 14:36:41 <scela>	?
Oct 25 14:36:53 <rgrunber>	bahah yes.. i demand to have him back :P
Oct 25 14:37:21 <scela>	rgrunber: yeah he's half jeff though, as he's badly jetlagged 
Oct 25 14:37:51 <scela>	rgrunber: did you see our picture on memo-list ?
Oct 25 14:37:58 <rgrunber>	so he's all Johnny Slacker.
Oct 25 14:38:22 <rgrunber>	hmm i saw something about people at eclipsecon... hmm
Oct 25 14:38:36 <rgrunber>	memo-list or devtools-internal
Oct 25 14:38:39 <scela>	rgrunber: we did a group picture with all of us
Oct 25 14:39:06 <scela>	rgrunber: memo-list, subject is: WARHW – Meanwhile in Ludwigsburg
Oct 25 14:39:24 <scela>	rgrunber: from Jens Reimann
Oct 25 14:39:34 <rgrunber>	nice..
Oct 25 14:39:36 <rgrunber>	haha
Oct 25 14:40:01 <rgrunber>	i particularly approve of the distance between you guys and Jeff :P
Oct 25 14:40:22 <rgrunber>	doesn't have time for your shenanigans
Oct 25 14:41:26 <scela>	rgrunber: no he was just slow in thinking what to do :)
Oct 25 14:41:33 <scela>	rgrunber: you can see he's thinking hard :)
Oct 25 14:42:38 <rgrunber>	if it weren't for the Red Hat cap you could swear someone just decided to photobomb all you attendees :P
Oct 25 14:45:20 <rgrunber>	scela: anyways have fun :) no huge rush on lucene6 testing.. i'm pretty much focused on some devtools stuff until the end of week.
Oct 25 14:46:09 <mbooth>	scela: Hehe, someone should reply to Max, "take the hint!"
Oct 25 14:55:33 <scela>	rgrunber: ok 
Oct 25 15:01:35 <fbricon>	rgrunber: can you check if https://hudson.eclipse.org/m2e/job/m2e-gerrit/ws/org.eclipse.m2e.site/target/repository/ fixes your rpm issue?
Oct 25 15:01:53 <fbricon>	it's m2e 1.8 here, but that should work
Oct 25 15:02:32 <fbricon>	rgrunber: see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/83893/
Oct 25 15:55:24 <rgrunber>	nboldt: did you see Fred's post ?
Oct 25 15:56:43 <nboldt>	rgrunber: above? yes, he also pinged on HC and I commented
Oct 25 16:32:09 <nboldt>	mbenitez: no meeting tomorrow? ¿por qué?
Oct 25 16:32:29 <rgrunber>	i guess because half the team is at eclipsecon..
Oct 25 16:32:43 <nboldt>	rgrunber: fair enough :D
Oct 25 16:33:03 <mbenitez>	nboldt, exactly! blame eclipseCon
Oct 25 16:33:21 <mbenitez>	plus the most urgent stuff we basically discussed today
Oct 25 16:33:39 <nboldt>	true enough
Oct 25 16:33:39 <mbenitez>	unless somebody wants the call, I could reinstate it
Oct 25 16:33:46 <nboldt>	nah, just curious
Oct 25 16:35:17 <mbenitez>	ok :)
Oct 25 17:36:51 <mbooth>	nboldt: How do I invoke build.sh these days to test build devstudio rpm?
Oct 25 17:38:19 <nboldt>	run it without params. it'll tell you how to use it
Oct 25 17:38:21 <nboldt>	mbooth: ^
Oct 25 17:38:35 <nboldt>	suggest you use either the staging or snapshot URL
Oct 25 17:38:58 <nboldt>	staging won't change (it's got AM2 bits in it) but if you want bleeding edge, use snapshots URL
Oct 25 17:39:05 <mbooth>	nboldt: Okay, the many examples scared me :-)
Oct 25 17:39:15 <nboldt>	well, it can be used in a number of ways :D
Oct 25 17:52:21 <akazakov>	nboldt, so we are updating m2e to 1.8 in our rpm?
Oct 25 17:53:25 <akazakov>	or 1.8 is for oxygen and we are waiting for 1.7.1 or whatever is for Neon
Oct 25 17:54:08 <nboldt>	akazakov: fred is waiting for approval from m2e to push his PR into 1.7.x as well as into 1.8
Oct 25 17:54:33 <akazakov>	ah ok. thought it's already merged
Oct 25 17:54:33 <nboldt>	then we can spin up a 1.7.1, pull that into devstudio target platform, respin, etc.
Oct 25 17:54:43 <nboldt>	maybe - you shoudl ask him
Oct 25 17:55:18 <nboldt>	at 2:49pm Fred said "if igor validates that, I will backport it"
Oct 25 17:55:25 <nboldt>	that was 3hrs ago
Oct 25 17:55:37 <akazakov>	ok
Oct 25 18:18:13 *	scox is away: 
**** BEGIN LOGGING AT Wed Oct 26 09:57:07 2016

Oct 26 09:57:07 *	Now talking on #eclipse
Oct 26 09:57:07 *	Topic for #eclipse is: Eclipse discussions
Oct 26 09:57:07 *	Topic for #eclipse set by akurtakov!~akurtakov@vpn1-5-170.ams2.redhat.com (Tue May 17 08:53:56 2016)
Oct 26 10:00:09 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Hi, when I update the builds in errata, I notice there is a new box for RHEL 7.3... Should I leave it empty? I've only been testing on RHEL 7.2
Oct 26 10:01:45 <mbenitez>	mbooth, good question, 7.3 is going GA next week I think... we'll need QE to confirm
Oct 26 10:02:03 <mbenitez>	they usually test new releases out of the normal cycle, not sure what's the case for this
Oct 26 10:02:32 <mbenitez>	we'll probably want to ship for 7.3 too since our GA is after it
Oct 26 10:03:42 <mbenitez>	mbooth, I just asked in #devtools
Oct 26 10:03:54 <mbooth>	Hmm, that thought occurred to me too
Oct 26 10:12:32 <mbenitez>	mbooth, Martin says we should be fine if we fill in builds for 7.3, not sure what would happen if we don't [because otherwise all the builds need to be added/waived there]
Oct 26 10:12:56 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I will fill it in then, "what could go wrong?" :-)
Oct 26 10:13:30 <mbenitez>	mbooth, don't jinx it :D
Oct 26 10:20:41 *	scox is back (gone 00:01:00)
Oct 26 10:27:20 <mbooth>	Not sure how I never accidentally discovered this before but if you put "~/workspace" into the workspace chooser dialog, Eclipse unhelpfully creates a directory called "~" in your home dir in which to put your workspace.... :-/
Oct 26 10:27:56 <mbooth>	I was too scared to remove it by typing "rm -r ~/~"
Oct 26 10:50:25 <rgrunber>	mbooth: makes sense :P .. the workspace chooser is not a bash shell :P
Oct 26 10:51:00 <rgrunber>	but yeah I hear ya.. RFE :D
Oct 26 10:57:43 <maxandersen>	rgrunber on OSX file dialogs translate ~ to your home dir. very useful ;)
Oct 26 11:00:05 <rgrunber>	there's gotta be a reason it never made it to Linux.. someone must have put their foot down :P
Oct 26 11:46:38 <maxandersen>	@rgrunber yeah, some crazy engineer not a ux person for sure ;)
Oct 26 11:46:59 <rgrunber>	http://git.eclipse.org/c/equinox/rt.equinox.framework.git/tree/features/org.eclipse.equinox.executable.feature/library/cocoa/eclipseCocoaMain.c#n144 .. though i don't see how that is used by the workspace chooser..
Oct 26 11:47:20 <maxandersen>	@rgrunber actually, probably got removed because couldnt find a way to resolve env variables and other bash like expressions ;)
Oct 26 11:48:06 <rgrunber>	mbooth: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=72607
Oct 26 11:50:05 <rgrunber>	ok nvm that source i referenced was only for cli arguments. everyone claims it worked at some point but have no idea where it is.
Oct 26 11:50:37 <mbooth>	maxandersen: "Full posix support or get out" -- someone with a longer, more grey beard than me? ;)
Oct 26 12:03:52 <msimacek>	nboldt: hi Nick, do you have time to discuss the slf4j BSN problem?
Oct 26 12:04:49 <rgrunber>	brb (lunch n learn).. (i'll be looking at the slf4j discussion later)
Oct 26 12:12:45 <nboldt>	msimacek: can we talk in 30 mins? have another call starting shortly
Oct 26 12:13:02 <msimacek>	nboldt: ok
Oct 26 12:13:55 <nboldt>	msimacek: feel free to ask questions on https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4136
Oct 26 12:31:51 <nboldt>	msimacek: ok, I'm free. what do you want to know?
Oct 26 12:34:29 <msimacek>	nboldt: we're not really sure how to address the problem - we cannot do the rename as you proposed, it would break packages from other collections that already depend on the name
Oct 26 12:34:44 <nboldt>	you have bundle-require dependencies ?
Oct 26 12:35:12 <nboldt>	msimacek: ^
Oct 26 12:35:54 <nboldt>	mbooth: have you had more think on the idea of postprocessing things in devstudio rpm to work around this snafu?
Oct 26 12:36:12 <msimacek>	nboldt: yes, some eclipse components have bundle dependencies, AFAIK
Oct 26 12:36:37 <nboldt>	crap. then those components TOO should be fixed to use package-import 
Oct 26 12:37:45 <msimacek>	nboldt: what components of devstudio would need to be changed to Import-Package?
Oct 26 12:38:54 <msimacek>	nboldt: mbooth pointed out that eclipse-m2e which you need was already fixed upstream, could you use it?
Oct 26 12:39:16 <nboldt>	well, we're already looking at fixing m2e, m2e-wtp, hibernate tools, red hat central, and livereload
Oct 26 12:39:31 <nboldt>	it's not fixed yet. it's BEING fixed
Oct 26 12:39:40 <nboldt>	we're waiting for 1.7.1 to be released
Oct 26 12:40:01 <nboldt>	and yes, we'd want to include that to fix its bundle-require on the other slf4j.api
Oct 26 12:40:36 <nboldt>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-3984 lists all the child issues related to import-package / bundle-require / uses-constraint violation
Oct 26 12:45:45 <nboldt>	msimacek: looks like you're right, the fix was merged to 1.7.x branch of m2e
Oct 26 12:45:54 <nboldt>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4136?focusedCommentId=13312233&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13312233
Oct 26 12:46:16 <nboldt>	but as akazakov says, we ought to fix this in the rh-* packages and their dependencies too
Oct 26 12:50:37 <mbooth>	nboldt: Re: post-processing, I would be doing what this m2e patch does, but with some shell script to edit the manifests in-situ. But if patch was merged, why not just use a snapshot of m2e?
Oct 26 12:51:22 <nboldt>	...because GA bits aren't built on snapshots
Oct 26 12:51:45 <nboldt>	we wait for milestones at the very least, or full Final builds when possible
Oct 26 12:52:01 <nboldt>	but for this urgent thing, yeah, we might make an exception
Oct 26 12:52:21 <mbooth>	... but I thought the devstudio rpm contained not GA bits anyway? Hence the 4.4.1 versus 4.4.2 discussion yesterday...
Oct 26 12:52:46 <nboldt>	well, yeah, that's the jbosstools stuff that we're still finalizing
Oct 26 12:53:09 <nboldt>	I'm talking upstream stuff from Eclipse which we use as a stable target platform against which to develop the jbt/devstudio stuff
Oct 26 12:54:24 <nboldt>	can't find any m2e 1.7.x builds available yet. https://otto.takari.io/content/sites/m2e.extras/m2e/1.7.0/N/ is the closest and that's from June 3 2016
Oct 26 12:57:10 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yeah this is the nice thing about building from source in RPMs, we can apply patches from upstream to fix critical bugs without having to wait for upstream release... :-)
Oct 26 12:57:40 <nboldt>	sure but if I rebuild it it'll have a different timestamp than the official one from eclipse
Oct 26 13:15:39 <msimacek>	nboldt: so do you think it would it be possible to solve the problem without changing rh-java-common?
Oct 26 13:16:21 <nboldt>	we're working on the problem from both ends
Oct 26 13:16:39 <nboldt>	fixing jbosstools and maven stuff fixes things for the immediate problem (devstudio)
Oct 26 13:17:02 <nboldt>	but as akazakov has said (and I agree) we really ought to fix this in rh-common-java AS WELL
Oct 26 13:17:15 <nboldt>	otherwise this problem could reappear in future for other stuff
Oct 26 13:17:28 <nboldt>	but it's not something that NEEDS to be fixed for SCL 2.3. Maybe 2.4?
Oct 26 13:18:43 <mbooth>	IMO, it really ought to be fixed in orbit -- upstream slf4j project clearly has a different preferred BSN -- but this is obviously not an immediate solution
Oct 26 13:19:18 <nboldt>	well, then we need to bug rgrunber ^
Oct 26 13:21:40 <msimacek>	mbooth: I've seen upstream slf4j bugreport requesting change to eclipse's BSN and they seemed to be willing to make the change
Oct 26 13:22:13 <mbooth>	msimacek: At a major version bump, but is that likely to ever happen?
Oct 26 13:23:02 *	rgrunber is reading..
Oct 26 13:24:28 <rgrunber>	so you'd propose Orbit should move to slf4j.api
Oct 26 13:25:33 *	mbooth dons his Linux integrator's hat
Oct 26 13:25:35 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Ideally orbit wouldn't deviate from the BSN that the upstream project uses...
Oct 26 13:25:46 <rgrunber>	true, it is what upstream uses..
Oct 26 13:26:18 <rgrunber>	the questin is did Orbit deviate or did it decide to make some reasonable choice when upstream made none.. and upstream went another way..
Oct 26 13:26:48 <mbooth>	Good question, I don't know the answer to that
Oct 26 13:27:01 <rgrunber>	well even 1.6.0 is slf4j.api so.. hmm
Oct 26 13:27:18 <msimacek>	mbooth: no idea
Oct 26 13:27:52 <akazakov>	http://jira.qos.ch/browse/SLF4J-262
Oct 26 13:28:07 <akazakov>	the issue is still open
Oct 26 13:29:33 <rgrunber>	ah good catch.. I see Gunnar's comment too.
Oct 26 13:32:21 <mbooth>	I'm sure that "because convention" is a great reason to change BSN when orbit contains bundles named like "cdi.api" "scannotation" and "jnr.ffi" ;-)
Oct 26 13:32:36 <mbooth>	s/sure/not sure/
Oct 26 13:33:58 <rgrunber>	jnr.* was named as such by me because upstream didn't own one and it seemed the most reasonable (ie. their packages all start as jnr/${pkgname})
Oct 26 13:34:21 <rgrunber>	now that upstream has accepted a bunch of my osgi patches.. they will be named com.github.jnr..
Oct 26 13:35:14 <rgrunber>	though in our case we're lucky that Linux Tools is the main (only?) consumer of that so it's a painless process as import-package is already the case for most/all things.
Oct 26 13:37:12 <nboldt>	 *meanwhile, at the m2e slf4j problem* I'm building m2e 1.7.1 in our jenkins because it's not building at eclipse (blocked by infrastructure issues w. their nexus proxy)
Oct 26 13:37:37 <nboldt>	https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/DevStudio/view/devstudio_10.0.neon/job/m2e-1.7.x/3/console ... once this is built I can suck it into the devstudio rpm build
Oct 26 13:37:56 <nboldt>	but m2e-wtp and m2e-apt will have to be rebuilt too (Fred's working on it)
Oct 26 13:44:40 <nboldt>	rgrunber: do you know how to inject a file from the local filesystem into the mock filesystem as part of the spec file?
Oct 26 13:45:03 <rgrunber>	nboldt: mock -r .. --copyin ?
Oct 26 13:45:18 <rgrunber>	mock  [options] --copyin path [path...] destination
Oct 26 13:45:29 <nboldt>	I've tried two approaches here, neither works.
Oct 26 13:45:30 <nboldt>	https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/devstudio.spec.template#L105-L120
Oct 26 13:46:06 <rgrunber>	or if you laugh at these puny mock options, you can just sudo cp $src /var/lib/mock/$config/root/
Oct 26 13:46:22 <nboldt>	I'd prefer to dynamically adjust the eclipse.ini file as part of the %install step
Oct 26 13:46:31 <rgrunber>	ahh in spec ?!
Oct 26 13:46:38 <nboldt>	maybe I should be doing this in the %build? 
Oct 26 13:46:51 <nboldt>	or %prep?
Oct 26 13:47:24 <rgrunber>	mock runs chrooted though.. so it wouldn't access the host filesystem..
Oct 26 13:47:51 <nboldt>	idea is that when installing rh-eclipse46-devstudio, we change the eclipse.ini file to increase memory (-Xms) and add some vmargs (-D...)
Oct 26 13:48:18 <nboldt>	but then on uninstall we should revert those changes to the default eclipse.ini that sits in /usr/lib64/eclipse/eclipse.ini (or /etc/eclipse.ini)
Oct 26 13:48:43 <rgrunber>	ahh..like the nashorn stuff for extended framework.. 
Oct 26 13:48:49 <nboldt>	YES! :D
Oct 26 13:49:04 <rgrunber>	that seems like  %postun/%post scriptlet thingie
Oct 26 13:49:06 <nboldt>	not sure if we need the equinox transforms stuff
Oct 26 13:49:33 <rgrunber>	i saw a bug in fedora about a user needing nashorn extension for eclipse-webtools functionality btw.. 
Oct 26 13:49:39 <nboldt>	ok, but how can I reference a file that isn't in the %files bucket?
Oct 26 13:49:59 <nboldt>	oh, so we could enable this extension on the eclipse-webtools package?
Oct 26 13:50:11 <nboldt>	and have IT add the -D flag ?
Oct 26 13:50:36 <rgrunber>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Scriptlets
Oct 26 13:50:54 <nboldt>	lol, JUST opened that link from a google search #greatMinds
Oct 26 13:50:56 <rgrunber>	basically they are segments in the spec that are triggered on package install/update/uninstall/etc..
Oct 26 13:51:23 <nboldt>	ok, so can't use %install because that's in ref to local files in the build
Oct 26 13:51:37 <nboldt>	but %post can ref things that are installed from depedent pacakges ?
Oct 26 13:51:40 <mbooth>	nboldt: rgrunber: I already added some nastiness to webtools rpm get the framework extension installed in the right place: http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/rpms/eclipse-webtools/tree/eclipse-webtools.spec?h=rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7#n488
Oct 26 13:53:01 <nboldt>	looks like you're just using symlinks to dedupe
Oct 26 13:53:31 <nboldt>	I see nowhere that you're editing eclipse.ini
Oct 26 13:53:41 <rgrunber>	it should be able to reference anything on the system.. but i haven't used it..
Oct 26 13:54:01 <rgrunber>	iirc most of the changes we've done to eclipse.ini we add at build time into eclipse.ini..
Oct 26 13:54:04 <rgrunber>	mbooth: ^ correct me if i'm wrong.
Oct 26 13:54:20 <mbooth>	Right, I didn't add that yet. Probably I would add eclipse.ini stuff to eclipse-platform package directly, if it's benign for the config to be there when the extension is not present
Oct 26 13:54:24 <rgrunber>	i don't think we carry any changes like "if this package is installed modify eclipse.ini with this extension"
Oct 26 13:54:47 <nboldt>	so posttrans is after install stuff is dropped to disk and postun is after the uninstall is done?
Oct 26 13:56:10 <mbooth>	Yeah. The problem with editing eclipse.ini from another package is that your changes will get blown away when eclipse updates
Oct 26 13:56:54 <nboldt>	true but updates to eclipse shouldn't happen until we have a new devstudio too... right?
Oct 26 13:57:18 <nboldt>	(or I can just ship a devstudio rebuild every time eclipse.ini is reverted by an eclipse update
Oct 26 13:58:06 <nboldt>	maybe we can use  %triggerin for eclipse packages that edit eclipse.ini ?
Oct 26 13:58:23 <mbooth>	And what the user does "yum update eclipse-platform" and does not recive your devstudio rebuild :-(
Oct 26 13:59:10 <nboldt>	I'd need to set an upper limit on teh version of eclipse-platform so update isn't possible?
Oct 26 14:02:12 <rgrunber>	not sure i like where this is going..
Oct 26 14:02:18 <mbooth>	Hmm, I think it would be better to just make the changes in the main eclipse package
Oct 26 14:02:42 <nboldt>	ok
Oct 26 14:03:41 <rgrunber>	can eclipse handle '-Dosgi.framework.extensions=org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.nashorn.extension' even when the bundle doesn't exist ?
Oct 26 14:03:52 <nboldt>	no idea
Oct 26 14:04:29 <mbooth>	I think it might moan about it the log, but should be benign
Oct 26 14:04:36 <nboldt>	is this the spec to edit ? http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/rpms/eclipse/tree/eclipse.spec?h=rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7
Oct 26 14:05:18 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yeah could add it around line 723
Oct 26 14:05:23 <nboldt>	http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/rpms/eclipse/tree/eclipse.spec?h=rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7#n717
Oct 26 14:05:26 <nboldt>	yep, just found it
Oct 26 14:05:38 <nboldt>	ok, I can submit a PR against this... 
Oct 26 14:05:49 <nboldt>	so I need a RH BZ ?
Oct 26 14:06:23 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yeah, current git rules require a three-acked bug
Oct 26 14:06:37 <rgrunber>	if it works in rh-eclipse46.. be sure to backport to fedora a it'd likely fix https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1380438
Oct 26 14:07:14 <nboldt>	then ... uh... https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Red%20Hat%20Software%20Collections -> rh-eclipse46 ?
Oct 26 14:10:06 <rgrunber>	^ i guess that was for mbooth ?
Oct 26 14:10:45 <mbooth>	version "rh-eclipse46", component "eclipse" would be the right params, yeah
Oct 26 14:11:13 <rgrunber>	the ack options should appear anyways when it's created.
Oct 26 14:11:17 <nboldt>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1389057 opened
Oct 26 14:11:40 <nboldt>	I'm reminded how much I hate BZ over JIRA. Can't edit descriptions? Is it 2016 or 1998? Geez
Oct 26 14:12:26 <mbooth>	Heh, I hate Jira cos no quote/reply button, is it 2016 or 1998? ;-p
Oct 26 14:12:59 <nboldt>	just use {quote} in the comment
Oct 26 14:13:04 <nboldt>	or {code}
Oct 26 14:13:41 <mbooth>	Ain't nobody got time to copy and paste chunks of reply with the mouse :-p
Oct 26 14:13:42 <nboldt>	can BZ do embedded images? can it do links to external trackers? can it nest issues (subtasks, epics) ?
Oct 26 14:14:11 *	rgrunber hates 2016
Oct 26 14:17:44 <nboldt>	mbooth: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=294877 looks closed, but I see http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/rpms/eclipse/tree/eclipse.spec?h=rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7#n722
Oct 26 14:20:04 <nboldt>	ok, dumb question... how do I submit a PR against git://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/rpms/eclipse ? do I need to clone a fork of that to github? Or is there some other way (like a patch instead of a pr) ?
Oct 26 14:20:14 <nboldt>	mbooth:  rgrunber: ^
Oct 26 14:21:02 <rgrunber>	nboldt: you need to make sure your commit references a 'rhbz#' that has received 'the 3 acks'.. if it's outside the devel phase.
Oct 26 14:21:23 <nboldt>	rgrunber: I see your words but they make not the sense
Oct 26 14:21:28 <rgrunber>	in essense the bug is the 'pr'.. but there's no other review system attached to the repo.
Oct 26 14:21:53 <nboldt>	are you saying the commit message has to start with rhbz#1389057 ?
Oct 26 14:22:20 <rgrunber>	or i believe the changelog of the spec needs to reference the bug.. yes
Oct 26 14:23:03 <nboldt>	ok, I can add that to the commit
Oct 26 14:23:11 <nboldt>	but again, how do I submit it?
Oct 26 14:23:18 <nboldt>	patch attached to bz?
Oct 26 14:23:22 <nboldt>	1998-style?
Oct 26 14:23:45 <nboldt>	in jira-world I submit a pull request and it automatically attaches itself to the JIRA
Oct 26 14:24:13 <rgrunber>	no.. i think in the BZ, the acks merely confirm that this is important to fix/there are resources for qe to test this..
Oct 26 14:24:45 <rgrunber>	the server on which the git instance runs checks your commit for a bug # that has 3 acks approved.
Oct 26 14:24:59 <rgrunber>	and pushes/rejects it depending on that.
Oct 26 14:25:07 <rgrunber>	no need to attach patch
Oct 26 14:25:33 <nboldt>	so I push the commit directly to origin?
Oct 26 14:25:37 <nboldt>	I don't have push rights
Oct 26 14:26:18 <rgrunber>	does your kerberos account have 'devel' permissions ?
Oct 26 14:28:20 <nboldt>	I have no idea. how do I check?
Oct 26 14:28:35 <rgrunber>	ugh one sec.. can't remember that command to list all the accounts.
Oct 26 14:28:43 <nboldt>	klist -a
Oct 26 14:28:43 <nboldt>	 ?
Oct 26 14:29:15 <rgrunber>	you could try id ${kerberos_username}
Oct 26 14:30:10 <nboldt>	1070(devel) ?
Oct 26 14:30:15 <rgrunber>	yes
Oct 26 14:30:23 <nboldt>	mmkay, so then ... ?
Oct 26 14:30:50 <nboldt>	$➔ git push origin rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7
Oct 26 14:30:50 <nboldt>	fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Oct 26 14:30:50 <nboldt>	Please make sure you have the correct access rights
Oct 26 14:30:50 <nboldt>	and the repository exists.
Oct 26 14:31:20 <nboldt>	I should push to git://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/rpms/eclipse ? or some other variable (ssh? https?)
Oct 26 14:31:28 <rgrunber>	url = ssh://nboldt@pkgs.devel.redhat.com/rpms/eclipse
Oct 26 14:42:07 <nboldt>	ok, so I can't push the commit to my fork (url above) because no acks on the bz
Oct 26 14:42:14 <nboldt>	but at least I can push :D
Oct 26 14:42:20 <nboldt>	(just not successfully)
Oct 26 14:43:35 <rgrunber>	yay.. so one of those acks should come from mbenitez iirc..
Oct 26 14:44:39 <nboldt>	mbenitez: care to ack this? https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1389057
Oct 26 14:44:51 <rgrunber>	iirc you set the devel_ack to '?' ..
Oct 26 14:45:04 <mbenitez>	nboldt, was just looking at it, mat dev_ack'd I'll ask the other two
Oct 26 14:45:14 <nboldt>	woo, thanks
Oct 26 14:45:47 <nboldt>	what an odd process: approve the IDEA of doing a fix before the suggested solution can even be reviewed. seems very PgM-like
Oct 26 14:46:03 <nboldt>	rather than solution-driven
Oct 26 14:46:14 <rgrunber>	psht.. I remember when dts had that in-place even during the devel-phase.
Oct 26 14:46:18 <nboldt>	*shrug* too many years of github have corrupted me :D
Oct 26 14:46:24 <mbenitez>	:)
Oct 26 14:46:28 <rgrunber>	and we did the ol.. create one dummy bug and everyone use it.
Oct 26 14:46:37 <nboldt>	oh, this is harder because code freeze? it's not like this all the time?
Oct 26 14:46:52 <rgrunber>	yeah.. so during development you can push without this.
Oct 26 14:46:58 <nboldt>	rgrunber: lol, where there's an onerous process, there's a hackaround :D
Oct 26 14:47:06 <nboldt>	and it goes live w/o review? 
Oct 26 14:47:06 <mbenitez>	it's an attempt to contain the amount of work that makes it into every phase, righn now we're on RC so every fix has to be reviewed by all teams involved
Oct 26 14:47:42 <nboldt>	why can't there be a "push as suggestion to be reviewed" ?
Oct 26 14:47:43 <mbenitez>	no
Oct 26 14:47:57 <mbenitez>	a bug will go into errata and qe reviews each bug there
Oct 26 14:48:17 <nboldt>	oic, so once acked it DOES go in as possible (but not merged) until someone approves the diff?
Oct 26 14:49:09 <mbenitez>	well, the build is done, it just can't be released until QE finishes
Oct 26 14:49:38 <mbenitez>	for now the acks are to prove each team agrees on taking the risk of the fix
Oct 26 14:50:59 <nboldt>	does this count as a blocker? without this (or a downstream hack instead in rh-eclipse46-devstudio) jsdt won't work in devstudio installed via rpm
Oct 26 14:51:15 *	nboldt is looking at hte list of available flags on the bz
Oct 26 14:52:33 <mbenitez>	nboldt, is there a fix now?
Oct 26 14:52:53 <mbenitez>	short answer is yes this is a blocker for devstudio
Oct 26 14:53:16 <nboldt>	mbenitez: well, the fix is in the patch on the bz
Oct 26 14:53:32 <mbenitez>	ok
Oct 26 14:53:54 <nboldt>	and if I fix this in the devstudio rpm instead of in eclipse, then the fix will be unfixed if the eclipse package is updated 
Oct 26 14:54:18 <mbenitez>	nboldt, I'd say let's leave it without the blocker flag for now
Oct 26 14:54:19 <nboldt>	which means a devstudio user who has jsdt working ootb will break it as soon as he `yum update eclipse` 
Oct 26 14:54:28 <mbenitez>	oh right, saw that in your earlier conversation
Oct 26 14:54:46 <nboldt>	workaround there would be to simply reinstall rh-eclipse46-devstudio AFTER the eclipse update
Oct 26 14:55:09 <nboldt>	but that's a pain in the a$$ as it's like 500M of crap to redownload just to hack one text file :D
Oct 26 14:55:48 <mbenitez>	no kidding!
Oct 26 14:56:09 <nboldt>	and having to have a readme/known issues doc for this would be kinda embarassing :D
Oct 26 14:56:38 <mbenitez>	agreed
Oct 26 14:57:10 <mbenitez>	nboldt, missing ack should come shortly, already requested
Oct 26 14:59:03 <nboldt>	cool, thanks. learning this new process & all the steps/interlocks required
Oct 26 15:00:46 <nboldt>	anyone know what "-Dosgi.bundles=org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator@1:start,org.eclipse.equinox.transforms.xslt@1:start,org.jboss.tools.equinox.transforms.xslt@1:start" is useful for on eclipse.ini startup?
Oct 26 15:01:12 <mbenitez>	don't worry, it takes us all a while :P too many variants
Oct 26 15:01:15 <nboldt>	that's in the devstudio.ini from the installer'd product, but not in default eclipse.ini... wondering if that's useful for us for performance reasons
Oct 26 15:02:02 <nboldt>	it's been in there for YEARS so don;'t know if it was a juno/kepler hack or if it's still relevant
Oct 26 15:12:15 <nboldt>	nm, not sure where I saw that. seems obsolete/removed
Oct 26 15:12:30 <nboldt>	anyway, pr pushed on https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1389057
Oct 26 15:12:42 <nboldt>	thx, mbenitez mbooth rgrunber for your help
Oct 26 15:13:44 <mbenitez>	glad this is moving fwd :)

Oct 31 09:58:34 *	Now talking on #eclipse
Oct 31 09:58:34 *	Topic for #eclipse is: Eclipse discussions
Oct 31 09:58:34 *	Topic for #eclipse set by akurtakov!~akurtakov@vpn1-5-170.ams2.redhat.com (Tue May 17 08:53:56 2016)
Oct 31 10:23:40 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: i had a patch i was working on to temporarily get gerrit passing but hipp issues all of friday.
Oct 31 11:08:50 <nboldt>	rgrunber: any more thoughts on your patch to disable the constraint checker?
Oct 31 11:09:12 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i'm testing it now on the latest devstudio
Oct 31 11:09:20 <nboldt>	rgrunber: sweet, thanks
Oct 31 11:10:35 <rgrunber>	from past testing it improved initial startup to around 40s but again i wasn't on the latest devstudio. also startup time after installing from an update site was still quite bad.. only disabling the reconciler would fix that.
Oct 31 11:12:38 <nboldt>	rgrunber: if we disable the reconciler... would people have to restart with -clean to force reconciliation to occur?
Oct 31 11:13:08 <nboldt>	worried that people will install stuff in dropins or from update sites, and stuff won't be activated because no reconciler
Oct 31 11:13:22 <rgrunber>	there's issues with disabling it.. or at least how i would do it.. i see deadlocked threads.
Oct 31 12:27:59 <scela>	@eclipse-interested-people: i put the minutes of our platform summit held during ECE in https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform/summitece2016
Oct 31 14:38:06 <rgrunber>	nboldt: sorry for giant delay.. testing a couple of things and rebuilds take a while :(
Oct 31 14:39:21 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i was getting ~18 seconds with disabling uses (needed an extra part to the patch to disbale the old uses logic as well).. it even worked after installing bundles.. problem is i had yet another patch on top which i believe didn't affect things but now i really wanna confirm.
Oct 31 14:40:03 <rgrunber>	also i think your fixing of broken requirements may have improved things in some way..
Oct 31 16:52:22 <nboldt>	rgrunber: cool. so we can get this pushed into rh-eclipse46-base? (once it's confirmed) ?
Oct 31 16:52:46 <nboldt>	I guess the good news is that we were seeing 7 mins and now it's only 4... so it's better, but still terrible. :D
Oct 31 16:53:49 <rgrunber>	yeah.. afaict this works.. and maintains initial startup at no more than 18s.
Oct 31 16:54:18 <rgrunber>	so i will push.. we still retain the ability to disable uses for debugging purposes..
Oct 31 16:55:22 <rgrunber>	s/disable/enable/
Oct 31 16:55:23 <nboldt>	\o/ cool. let me know when I can start playing with it here :D
Oct 31 16:55:43 <nboldt>	(I presume it'll take a few hours/day(s) to trickle down
Oct 31 16:55:45 <nboldt>	.)
Oct 31 16:56:18 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i'll push a scratch build to brew.. i wouldn't mind someone else confirming.
Oct 31 16:59:02 <nboldt>	ok
Oct 31 17:00:39 <rgrunber>	nboldt: when https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/taskinfo?taskID=11988484 finishes the rpms should be under that task.
Nov 01 05:46:03 <akurtakov>	mbooth: msrb: https://apps.fedoraproject.org/koschei/package/eclipse?collection=f26 maven-compiler-plugin breaks ecj resolution?
Nov 01 05:47:18 <msrb>	msimacek, ^ :)
Nov 01 05:49:17 <msimacek>	akurtakov: looking
Nov 01 05:51:06 <msimacek>	akurtakov: but it breaks more packages so I'll untag it for now
Nov 01 05:57:20 <akurtakov>	msimacek: I see, I just wanted to give early heads up cause ecj is kind of hacky too :)
Nov 01 06:55:06 <akurtakov>	mistria: hey
Nov 01 06:55:16 <mistria>	akurtakov: hi
Nov 01 06:55:29 <akurtakov>	I have removed surefire skipTests false
Nov 01 06:55:38 <akurtakov>	as it breaks when doing aggregator build
Nov 01 06:55:53 <mistria>	yes, I saw it
Nov 01 06:56:01 <mistria>	however I don't know how it breaks
Nov 01 06:56:02 <akurtakov>	we should do that only for build-individual-bundles profile
Nov 01 06:56:17 <mistria>	why would it break in aggregator and not in individual?
Nov 01 06:56:28 <akurtakov>	when doing releng.aggregator there is no previous p2 repo
Nov 01 06:57:03 <akurtakov>	it fails like before that with NoClassDef
Nov 01 06:57:20 <akurtakov>	which makes me think that the feature is not resolving fragments properly
Nov 01 06:57:25 <akurtakov>	but anyway
Nov 01 06:57:30 <mistria>	ok
Nov 01 06:57:53 <akurtakov>	we should not override this way as tests should not run when someone specifies -DskipTests on command line
Nov 01 06:58:02 <mistria>	right
Nov 01 06:58:31 <mistria>	It's also a reason why I suggest to backport
Nov 01 06:58:42 <mistria>	if we backport, then we can remove the "skipTests" on the job
Nov 01 06:58:51 <mistria>	and not have to override it to run only on master
Nov 01 07:41:24 <akurtakov>	mistria: probably yes, only thing that bothers me is stability of webkit tests on 4_6
Nov 01 09:10:18 <patrickm>	mbooth: i don't know if this is yours, but i certainly know it's not mine -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1367922
Nov 01 09:11:04 <mbooth>	patrickm: Thanks, I'll take a look
Nov 01 09:34:07 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: hi Mat, do you have by any chance some time for https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1376095#c9 (the EC point compression thing)?
Nov 01 09:34:34 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Sure, looking
Nov 01 09:34:42 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: thanks
Nov 01 10:19:03 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: please request review for the build.sh 
Nov 01 10:41:04 <akurtakov>	mistria: what do you think about making surefire config only for build-individual-bundles profile ?
Nov 01 10:41:32 <akurtakov>	that should be good enough for both hudson and releng.aggregator
Nov 01 10:41:52 <akurtakov>	after that we can backport but keeping it off
Nov 01 10:42:07 <akurtakov>	and finally enable in master?
Nov 01 10:52:52 <nboldt>	rgrunber: to test your patch https://issues.jboss.org/secure/attachment/12411604/12411604_disable-uses-by-default.patch I just need to install http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/brewroot/work/tasks/8485/11988485/rh-eclipse46-eclipse-platform-4.6.1-2.4.el7.x86_64.rpm correct?
Nov 01 10:53:48 <rgrunber>	nboldt: yes.. it should work fine as it'll be seen as an update if you already have platform stuff in your vm .. or mock chroot.
Nov 01 11:39:17 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ok, have to reinstall everything but work in progress now... #downloadTheInternet
Nov 01 11:40:07 <nboldt>	rgrunber: btw if I wanted a RHEL7 iso which I could install and which wouldn't complain about entitlements/licenses... where would I get that? Or is centos7 better?
Nov 01 11:40:48 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i would use just the isos off of engarchive2
Nov 01 11:40:55 <nboldt>	link?
Nov 01 11:41:04 <rgrunber>	i mean none really complain once you say 'no thanks' and just add your own yum repos.
Nov 01 11:41:16 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ok, cool. URL?
Nov 01 11:41:34 <nboldt>	for the ISOs, I mean, not for .repo files
Nov 01 11:41:56 <rgrunber>	you can mount as nfs : vtap-eng01.storage.rdu2.redhat.com:/vol/engarchive2
Nov 01 11:43:18 <rgrunber>	and then under released/RHEL-7/
Nov 01 11:43:43 <nboldt>	read: Connection reset by peer
Nov 01 11:43:43 <nboldt>	^ rgrunber ... maybe I'm not auth'd ?
Nov 01 11:44:33 <rgrunber>	ah.. are you wfh .. on .. vpn?
Nov 01 11:44:37 <nboldt>	oh, wait. nfs mount, not sshfs mount. /me goes to figure out how to do an nfs mount
Nov 01 11:44:45 <rgrunber>	mount -t nfs
Nov 01 11:46:08 <nboldt>	thanks. so ... 7.3RC3 ? or stick with 7.2?
Nov 01 11:46:52 <rgrunber>	the mock chroots are configured with 7.2.. so i would use that for now..
Nov 01 11:46:59 <nboldt>	and then ... Workstation? Client? Server? 
Nov 01 11:47:24 <rgrunber>	chroots are server but.. hmm workstation ought to work also.. it shouldn't make a difference.
Nov 01 11:50:54 <nboldt>	cool, thanks. fetching RHEL-7.2-20151030.0-Server-x86_64-dvd1.iso
Nov 01 12:10:19 <nboldt>	rgrunber: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4150?focusedCommentId=13315033&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13315033 seems we have an interloper. two versions of the same jar, but one is missing classes
Nov 01 12:16:33 <nboldt>	rgrunber: unless I installed it incorrectly, I still get a 4 min startup time after your patch
Nov 01 12:18:18 <nboldt>	yep, seems I still have the 2.3 versions of the rpms, not 2.4 :(
Nov 01 12:18:45 <rgrunber>	ah.. phew.. just try a yum update on the 2.4 ones.. it should just take them.
Nov 01 12:20:19 <nboldt>	when I did the update it uninstalled rh-eclipse46-devstudio.x86_64 and rh-eclipse46-base.x86_64 :(
Nov 01 12:21:04 <rgrunber>	didn't you have those already ? also the scratch built rpms are newer.. so it shouldn't override with older ones..
Nov 01 12:21:29 <nboldt>	it uninstalled due to dependency conflict
Nov 01 12:21:33 <rgrunber>	ahh.. i c
Nov 01 12:21:53 <rgrunber>	do devstudio and base hardcode the version-release ?
Nov 01 12:21:56 <rgrunber>	in their requires ?
Nov 01 12:22:41 <nboldt>	no, but that's what yum did
Nov 01 12:22:53 <nboldt>	https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/taskinfo?taskID=11988485 ... those files, right? (under Output)
Nov 01 12:23:20 <nboldt>	might be because I didn't install the new pde bundle too
Nov 01 12:23:29 <nboldt>	will pull that down too, and try again
Nov 01 12:23:41 *	nboldt hates it when steps to reproduce are "just install it" :(
Nov 01 12:23:52 <rgrunber>	you would probably need to install equinox-osgi, jdt, p2-discovery, pde, platform, and swt
Nov 01 12:24:30 <rgrunber>	ie. you can't have 4.6.1-2.3 of some of those, and 4.6.1-2.4 of others
Nov 01 12:25:15 <nboldt>	this I've learned :) but the pde one didn't seem to be needed since your patch only affected the single package 
Nov 01 12:25:42 <nboldt>	rpm deps dragged in the rest when I tried to install just one, but it didn't ask for PDE - just uninstalled devstudio instead
Nov 01 12:25:57 <rgrunber>	nboldt: yes, they're not but the requires among those eclipse rpms include the version-release so update can't happen through yum/dnf unless they're the same.
Nov 01 12:28:47 <rgrunber>	nboldt: oh and another fun thing to remember.. if you ever do want to get around issues like that cause you know you're right and that yum/dnf is too picky, you can do 'rpm -Uvh --nodeps $rpms' , specifically the --nodeps tells dependency metadata to be ignored.
Nov 01 12:29:33 <mbooth>	rgrunber: doing that voids your warranty though ;-)
Nov 01 12:29:52 <rgrunber>	it leaves the rpm install in a bad state.
Nov 01 12:34:00 <akazakov>	trying to install rh-eclipse46-devstudio-10.2 on my fedora and got:
Nov 01 12:34:02 <akazakov>	Error: Error downloading packages:
Nov 01 12:34:02 <akazakov>	  Cannot download toplink/packages/rh-java-common-apache-commons-collections/3.2.1/21.13.el7/noarch/rh-java-common-apache-commons-collections-3.2.1-21.13.el7.noarch.rpm: All mirrors were tried
Nov 01 12:34:11 <akazakov>	any idea why?
Nov 01 12:36:55 <mbooth>	akazakov: The software collections are built to run on RHEL, Fedora is not really supported
Nov 01 12:38:13 <akazakov>	it worked a week ago... Any workaround? I don't have RHEL available to try the devstudio rpm :(
Nov 01 12:39:35 <mbooth>	akazakov: I don't know. If it worked at all, it was by accident -- I never actually tried it on Fedora
Nov 01 12:40:21 <akazakov>	nboldt, are you using RHEL too?
Nov 01 12:44:24 <rgrunber>	mbooth: did you see nboldt's post about httpclient class missing ?
Nov 01 12:44:58 *	mbooth reads back
Nov 01 12:48:38 <rgrunber>	oh i think i know why
Nov 01 12:49:15 <rgrunber>	nboldt: mbooth http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/rpms/httpcomponents-client/tree/httpcomponents-client.spec?h=rhscl-2.3-rh-java-common-rhel-7#n48 .. the path is ./httpcomponents-client-4.3.6/httpclient-cache/src/main/java/org/apache/http/client/cache/HttpCacheStorage.java .. so it looks like it doesn't get built.
Nov 01 12:52:22 <rgrunber>	hmm but should it really be in httpclient main package ?
Nov 01 12:52:42 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Looks like it built as a separate jar in Fedora. Does orbit do some kind munging?
Nov 01 12:53:28 <rgrunber>	eve maven central doesn't have it in the main jar
Nov 01 12:53:35 *	rgrunber checks orbit
Nov 01 12:54:23 <rgrunber>	bingo.. Orbit to blame.
Nov 01 12:56:57 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Probably the solution would be get that jar built in the SCL (bug on rh-java-common) and then devstudio should import-package httpcomponents stuff
Nov 01 12:58:17 <mbooth>	And of course next version of httpcomponents in orbit should be made to DTRT :-)
Nov 01 12:59:05 <rgrunber>	so orbit shipped some horrible fusion of cache + client + (i don't wanna think about it) and called it httpclient.
Nov 01 12:59:41 <rgrunber>	mbooth: oh it will be.. because i'm pushing it in :P
Nov 01 12:59:47 <rgrunber>	(for docker-client)
Nov 01 12:59:48 <mbooth>	\o/
Nov 01 13:10:38 <akazakov>	it's not actually devstudio. Thym is in Eclipse. It's our upstream. And it requires the httpclient bundle 
Nov 01 13:10:54 <akazakov>	so we can't fix it in devstudio only
Nov 01 13:12:37 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: mbooth: make sure that ecf pulls latest/fixed httpclient
Nov 01 13:12:48 <akurtakov>	that would ensure that everyone else will get it :)
Nov 01 13:14:09 <mbooth>	Sure
Nov 01 13:17:57 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: spit package question..
Nov 01 13:18:56 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: how does a bundle make use of classes from both parts of a split package ?.. do i basically need an additional bundle that combines them all and import from that one ?
Nov 01 13:20:25 <akurtakov>	no
Nov 01 13:21:15 <akurtakov>	they will be merged at runtime
Nov 01 13:21:50 <akurtakov>	let me look for the post from chris daniel after the mylyn fiasco
Nov 01 13:22:33 <akurtakov>	http://eclipseandlinux.blogspot.bg/2013/04/on-evilness-of-split-packages-in-osgi.html
Nov 01 13:28:00 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: i have a bundle that exports a part of a split package and is exposed to the other part through a different import.
Nov 01 13:42:14 <nboldt>	akazakov: i'm on F24 for now but am trying to get a copy of RHEL7.2 I can use as well
Nov 01 13:42:39 <nboldt>	akazakov: look in your .repo files and see if you're excluding the rh-common or rh-java packages.
Nov 01 13:43:19 <nboldt>	akazakov: eg., use includepkgs=rh-* or omit the line entirely
Nov 01 14:02:08 <nboldt>	rgrunber: verified, your patch reduces rh-eclipse46-devstudio  start time from 4 mins to under 30 seconds. 
Nov 01 14:02:37 <rgrunber>	nboldt: gooood. i'd confirm with installing from update sites as well though from my testing that works too.
Nov 01 14:03:03 <nboldt>	now trying to reinstall devstudio ... seems the test I just ran was only Eclipse, not devstudio :( *sigh*
Nov 01 14:03:31 <nboldt>	wish there was a way to make rpm reinstalls not require downloading everything all over again :(
Nov 01 14:03:40 <nboldt>	isn't it supposed to cache the packages somewhere?
Nov 01 14:06:09 <rgrunber>	nboldt: no idea about yum.. but dnf probably would..
Nov 01 14:09:23 <nboldt>	seems to only cache if the install is interrupted. once it succeeds, it purges the cache. might be a setting I have to find /set to make them retained longer
Nov 01 14:16:22 <nboldt>	rgrunber: seems I'm hitting https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4151 :( can't start devstudio
Nov 01 14:17:29 <rgrunber>	nboldt: can you start with '-clean' flag ?
Nov 01 14:18:51 <nboldt>	sure, but I bet it'll be the same problem since the version of slf4j installed from rh-java-common-slf4j is 1.7.4 and he error is...
Nov 01 14:19:02 <nboldt>	  Unresolved requirement: Fragment-Host: org.slf4j.api; bundle-version="[1.7.2,1.7.3)" 
Nov 01 14:19:10 <nboldt>	https://issues.jboss.org/secure/attachment/12411818/eclipse.log
Nov 01 14:22:14 <nboldt>	yes, -clean fixes this problem. WEIRD.
Nov 01 14:22:17 <akazakov>	nboldt, I just ran a fresh installation. Can't reproduce this problem
Nov 01 14:22:20 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ^
Nov 01 14:22:26 <nboldt>	akazakov: I can. :D
Nov 01 14:22:50 <nboldt>	but only with Roland's patch applied. never saw it before that
Nov 01 14:23:05 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i've run into it before.. it might have something to do with mixing different versions of Eclipse on the same workspace..
Nov 01 14:23:27 <nboldt>	nope, I run with a new workspace every time for every startup
Nov 01 14:23:27 <rgrunber>	or different versions of eclipse with .eclipse/
Nov 01 14:23:45 <nboldt>	could be eclipse then devstudio w/ the same ~/.eclipse folder
Nov 01 14:24:24 <nboldt>	but yeah, this last time I didn't remove ~/.eclipse between the eclipse install and the devstudio install on top
Nov 01 14:24:29 <nboldt>	so could be ~/.eclipse problem
Nov 01 14:24:37 <rgrunber>	yet another problem to investigate :P
Nov 01 14:26:07 <nboldt>	I've left ideas in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4151 ... have to go afk for a bit but will be back online later
Nov 01 14:26:12 *	nboldt is afk
Nov 01 14:50:18 <akazakov>	so, rgrunber akurtakov any idea what we can do about that httpclient issue?
Nov 01 14:52:22 <rgrunber>	akazakov: probably what mbooth mentioned. we should file a bug in rh-java to include httpclient-cache as well.
Nov 01 14:53:26 <akazakov>	rgrunber, as a separate bundle?
Nov 01 14:53:57 <rgrunber>	seems like it'd have to be.. at upstream, it is part of a separate bundle.. just in Orbit it seems it was packaged together under httpclient.
Nov 01 14:54:17 <rgrunber>	then whatever is requiring the HttpStorageCache can just use import-package.
Nov 01 14:55:36 <akazakov>	rgrunber, when can httpclient-cache be included in rh-java? 
Nov 01 14:56:10 <akazakov>	will be it available by devstudio 10.2 release?
Nov 01 14:56:27 <akazakov>	end of November
Nov 01 14:57:22 <mbenitez>	doubt it, RC freeze was last week
Nov 01 14:57:46 <nboldt1>	akazakov: hard deadline for us is Nov 23
Nov 01 14:58:00 <akazakov>	mbenitez, so we have a blocker for mobile tooling
Nov 01 14:59:47 <akazakov>	nboldt1, could you please update the jira with all details and we need to discuss it with Gorkem to see what else can be done on thym side
Nov 01 15:10:48 <nboldt>	akazakov: the decision was to fix the jar in scl and in orbit?
Nov 01 15:11:08 <nboldt>	then use import-package instead of require-bundle in thym?
Nov 01 15:13:11 <rgrunber>	nboldt: in Orbit it won't be fixed until a newer version is out..
Nov 01 15:14:10 <nboldt>	rgrunber: so... not until the next Neon.2 or Oxygen.m4 milestone?
Nov 01 15:14:43 <rgrunber>	that's when I plan to get it in along with newer version of Docker Tooling bundles dependencies.
Nov 01 15:15:27 <nboldt>	so... Nov 11?
Nov 01 15:15:36 <nboldt>	which is Neon.2.RC1 +0 day
Nov 01 15:17:11 *	nboldt can't stop laughing at the Karate Kid reference that Max's IRC client makes every time he enters/leaves the room... "Max on? Max off."
Nov 01 15:30:56 <rgrunber>	nboldt: max-imum effort... max powers..
Nov 01 16:05:21 <akazakov>	rgrunber, so when are we going to get the cache bundle available for thym to import its packages?
Nov 01 16:11:39 <nboldt>	rgrunber: wait, you're moving up to newer Docker Tooling from Neon.2 this month? that means we'll have to do the same in devstudio TP :(
Nov 01 16:12:00 <nboldt>	any chance you could NOT update to docker from neon.2 until after devstudio 10.2 goes GA in Dec?
Nov 01 16:12:16 <rgrunber>	akazakov: mbooth or I can file the bug and see what owners say about it.
Nov 01 16:12:42 <rgrunber>	nboldt: that's most likely.. i mean i intended to get it in for M4.. Neon.2 next week is a bit tight.
Nov 01 16:13:20 <rgrunber>	i did consider spinning a new orbit R build for Neon.2 based on what we have but that would not contain any of the new docker stuff.
Nov 01 16:14:28 <nboldt>	hmm. so either way we'll have an S build of Orbit we can use for the devstudio 10.2 TP by the end of next week? or are you thinking Dec 9, the Oxygen M4 +0 date?
Nov 01 16:15:30 <rgrunber>	i intended for M4.. but seems like Neon.2 will be finalized well before M4.
Nov 01 16:15:31 <rgrunber>	ugh
Nov 01 16:15:52 <nboldt>	well, yes
Nov 01 16:16:28 <rgrunber>	basically there are people who want to use the new orbit-recipes stuff for Neon.2 .. and they would like a more persistent location.. ie.. an R-build.
Nov 01 16:16:48 <nboldt>	neon.2.RC1 +0 is nov 11, rc2 is nov 18, rc3 is nov 25, rc4 is dec 2, and oxygen M4 +0 is dec 9
Nov 01 16:17:37 <nboldt>	ah, so we can plan to get new apache.whatsit.httpthingy by end of next week? 
Nov 01 16:18:11 <nboldt>	I guess really it would be Nov 10 since Nov 11 is a holiday :D
Nov 01 16:18:52 <rgrunber>	nboldt: no that would have been part of what I'd want for M4. to fix that issue we can always file a bug in rh-java and ask them to build that component too.
Nov 01 16:19:36 <nboldt>	rgrunber: just need to know when you think it'll be done so we can tell akazakov and he can tell Tim
Nov 01 16:19:54 <nboldt>	pick a date, throw a dart. :D
Nov 01 16:24:26 *	rgrunber looks at rhscl planning dates
Nov 01 16:25:33 <akazakov>	gercan_, There is a problem with thym when installed as a part of devstudio via RPM - https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4150
Nov 01 16:26:34 <akazakov>	gercan_, It requires org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient bundle. Orbit (and or TP) actually includes some aggregated httpclient jar. Which includes packages from the cache jar.
Nov 01 16:27:36 <akazakov>	the problem is that when installed via RPM there is another bundle (not from orbit). Which doesn't include the cache packages.
Nov 01 16:27:56 <gercan_>	so file a bug to Orbit mark Jira as upstream and it will get resolved after we all retire as wont_fix
Nov 01 16:28:37 <gercan_>	ahh. and the plot 
Nov 01 16:30:02 <rgrunber>	nboldt: are the 2 versions of httpclient identical in bsn and version ?
Nov 01 16:30:08 <patrickm>	mbooth: thanks for handling the bz i mentioned
Nov 01 16:30:16 <akazakov>	gercan_, if we want to get this fixed a bit earlier than when we are retired then we could switch thyme to import-package instead of Required-bundle
Nov 01 16:30:50 <nboldt>	rgrunber: nope, one is 4.3.6 and one is 4.3.6.v20151117...
Nov 01 16:31:02 <nboldt>	see pic on https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4150
Nov 01 16:31:22 <gercan_>	akazakov: sure but isn't that the band-aid solution? until another bundle does the same 
Nov 01 16:33:12 <akazakov>	gercan_, yes it is. But we can request to fix the orbit too. But it will take longer. Just thinking about what we can do for devstudio 10.2
Nov 01 16:34:10 <akazakov>	but even if we switch thyme to import-package we will need that cache bundle available in rh-scl rpm anyway
Nov 01 16:34:15 <nboldt>	rgrunber: but the Bundle-SymbolicName: org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient is the same for both
Nov 01 16:36:32 <gercan_>	nboldt: also since the version difference is superficial they are the same from OSGi perspective
Nov 01 16:36:47 <nboldt>	gercan_: well, kinda. only one will be activated
Nov 01 16:37:05 <nboldt>	seems to be the BAD one (with no qualifier) which is being activated
Nov 01 16:37:23 <nboldt>	or else the WEIRD one (from orbit with qualifier) which is being ignored
Nov 01 16:37:45 <gercan_>	akazakov: are you trying to ask me to do a Thym release :)
Nov 01 16:38:34 <nboldt>	gercan_: we'll need a fix from thym, yes, but it doesn't have to be a GA release. we've been rolling with your snapshots for what, 6 months now?
Nov 01 16:40:16 <gercan_>	akazakov: nboldt: not a problem.. when do you need it.
Nov 01 16:40:40 <akazakov>	and this new thyme with import-package from gercan_ will help us if we have that cache bundle available in rh-java, but we didn't get an answer when it can be done. mbenitez?
Nov 01 16:40:53 <nboldt>	target platform freeze for this milestone is tomorrow. how does EOD tomorrow sound?
Nov 01 16:40:57 <nboldt>	gercan_: ^
Nov 01 16:41:16 <gercan_>	nboldt: Thym is not on TP 
Nov 01 16:41:33 <nboldt>	gercan_: then I just need it before GA code freeze in 3 weeks and 1 day
Nov 01 16:42:10 <gercan_>	nboldt: 3 weeks 23hrs later than :)
Nov 01 16:42:54 <nboldt>	gercan_: how about 2weeks so there's time to fix bugs?
Nov 01 16:43:11 <mbenitez>	akazakov, we don't own rh-java-common, and since we're past the RC deadline as mentioned... if accepted it'd be a z-stream, could you please send an email? to jorton, java-maint and eclipse-team like last time
Nov 01 16:44:18 <gercan_>	nboldt: ok, will do a release as soon as I remember how to make one 
Nov 01 16:47:54 <nboldt>	gercan_: cool. then you can be in Neon.2 or Oxygen.M4, too!
Nov 01 16:54:19 <gercan_>	nboldt: I will bump the version to 2.1 while I am at it. 
Nov 01 16:54:46 <gercan_>	nboldt: you did not like 2.0
Nov 01 16:55:56 <rgrunber>	nboldt: filed https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1390760 to see what'll happen on rh-java end.
Nov 01 16:58:14 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, thanks
Nov 01 16:59:27 <mbenitez>	akazakov, actually with the BZ above I can bring this up at tomorrow's rhscl call
Nov 01 17:01:33 <rgrunber>	so options are, fix in rh-java-common, ensure import-package is used and maybe even blacklist the orbit one from devstudio.. or only other option would be to bump version on Orbit upstream side so it's newer and use that in the TP.. and pending a CQ of httpclient-cache.
Nov 01 17:03:42 <akazakov>	mbenitez, please bring this up! And btw I was about to send that email you asked for...
Nov 01 17:03:58 <akazakov>	mbenitez, do you need me send it?
Nov 01 17:04:50 <mbenitez>	akazakov, I think we don't need the email, I updated the BZ requesting a zstream and I can talk to Joe tomorrow during the call
Nov 01 17:05:03 <akazakov>	good. thanks!
Nov 01 17:05:14 <mbenitez>	they were open to this when we talked about slf4j before, this should be easier since nothing depends on it
Nov 01 17:05:22 <akazakov>	I also will mention it on devtools SoS tomorrow 
Nov 01 17:09:02 <mbenitez>	sounds good
Nov 02 06:19:56 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: hi Mat, do you have any opinion on the EC point compression problem (bz1376095)?

Nov 02 09:30:46 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: mbenitez: I'm open to further changes but I'd like to hear your opinions b/c I'm not exactly very sure in that :-(
Nov 02 09:32:44 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Sure, I'm still trying to understand what is happening because my patch should cause attempts to set compression to be ignored :-(
Nov 02 09:33:11 <mbooth>	But I am also no crypto expert :-/
Nov 02 09:37:47 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: good, i mean good that you are looking :-)
Nov 02 09:42:43 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: are you thinking about making it in RHSCL 2.3? that would be awesome but i'm not that optimistic...
Nov 02 10:34:01 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, missed my msg earlier, there's an update to  BZ1390760 httpclient let me know how that sounds / if we need anything else there
Nov 02 10:35:41 <rgrunber>	nboldt: any idea on https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1390760#c1 .. specifically does Thym, or whatever is using HttpCacheStorage care what backend is being used ?
Nov 02 10:37:02 <rgrunber>	(basically rebuilding and using default memory backend is easy and requires no additional deps.. things get complicated when you want a particular backend with additional deps needed)
Nov 02 10:41:21 <nboldt>	"Thym has its own HttpCacheStorage implementation  it is not using any of the ready backends so my guess is default should be sufficient. OTOH, I have not done any testing. If you need a tested answer that is gonna take at least half my day" - gercan (who isn't on IRC)
Nov 02 10:42:47 <nboldt>	rgrunber: I've pinged gorkem to join here since you're not on hipchat
Nov 02 10:42:56 <rgrunber>	great, so i'd say memory would suffice.. what they really need is just the classes to implement..
Nov 02 10:43:08 *	nboldt wonders why we ever thought having two different chat methods was a good idea
Nov 02 10:43:21 <rgrunber>	i used to be hip
Nov 02 10:43:44 <nboldt>	you could be hip again
Nov 02 10:45:30 <rgrunber>	i'll wait for gercan to confirm but seems like default of memory is fine .. but meeting in 15min.. 
Nov 02 10:46:04 <rgrunber>	msimacek: ^ (and i'll post on the rhbz soon as well)
Nov 02 10:46:58 <rgrunber>	nboldt: oh great.. an invite to be hip
Nov 02 10:47:27 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ask and ye shall be cursed
Nov 02 10:48:11 <nboldt>	it's not that terrible. you can use a browser or run it inside Franz for a better experience
Nov 02 10:49:24 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i don't object to it, i object to having multiple chat mediums.
Nov 02 10:49:41 <rgrunber>	(i mean ignoring email, in-person :P )
Nov 02 10:52:36 <nboldt>	rgrunber_mtg: I agree... but at least Franz lets you collect all the blahblah into a single window. So... HC, FB, G+, Skype, and even freenode IRC in once place
Nov 02 10:52:49 <akazakov>	rgrunber_mtg, it will take for us some time to test. And Gorkem is pretty busy right now so not sure when we can do this testing. But in theory we should be good with the default stuff only
Nov 02 10:52:59 <nboldt>	can't stop the proliferation, but can at least use tools to make it less painful to manage 'em

Nov 02 12:07:45 <rgrunber>	however for now i'm keeping that split package attribute solution.. because adding another bundle seems .. meh
Nov 02 12:09:36 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Also that extra bundle won't exist in downstreams (see the million or so times where we "s/org.hamcrest/org.hamcrest.core/" in Fedora)
Nov 02 12:09:37 <nboldt>	rgrunber: more weirdness in an orbit bundle: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4149?focusedCommentId=13316240&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13316240
Nov 02 12:09:52 <nboldt>	this time for javax.servlet(-api)
Nov 02 12:14:46 <rgrunber>	nboldt: are they identical in classes proivded.. ie.. is the devstudio one (from orbit ? ) both api and impl while the one in rh-java-common is api.
Nov 02 12:15:02 <rgrunber>	i mean if it's in rh-java-common and no issues with it then the orbit one ough to be blacklisted.
Nov 02 12:15:34 <nboldt>	but with two different B-SN values we need to once again force upstream consumers to switch to import-package
Nov 02 12:15:48 <nboldt>	and yeah, another orbit bundle that needs to be fixed :(
Nov 02 12:20:02 <mbenitez>	painful right now, but good thing we have the Orbit king to help
Nov 02 12:20:56 <rgrunber>	nboldt: if people are using import-package it won't need a fix :P
Nov 02 12:21:01 <mbenitez>	mbooth, this is the JIRA we'd use for the infocentre https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DEVELOPER-3394

Nov 02 13:22:43 <rgrunber>	nboldt: were you able to reproduce the error with respect to httpclient ?
Nov 02 13:22:48 <rgrunber>	cnfe
Nov 02 13:23:43 <nboldt>	rgrunber: which one? 
Nov 02 13:24:08 <nboldt>	been on the planning council call and now just writing up notes... so no, haven't done any debugging yet
Nov 02 13:25:39 <rgrunber>	k, i'll try to reproduce to see if httpcache will actually fix that issue..
Nov 02 14:01:52 <nboldt>	rgrunber: https://issues.jboss.org/secure/attachment/12411970/12411970_eclipse_10.2-0.20161101.1258.log ... seeing constraint violations from jgit now. and that's not something devstudio rpm contains -- it's in upstream rpm :(
Nov 02 14:03:07 <rgrunber>	yeah so one of those should be blacklisted i would think..
Nov 02 14:07:50 <nboldt>	well, seems I added javax.servlet back into the rpm to fix JBDS-4131 ... but i guess we can remove it again and see what else in devstudio upstream jbosstool projects break due to require bundle :(
Nov 02 15:21:56 <rgrunber>	nboldt: so using httpclient-cache, and only adding 'org.apache.http.client.cache,org.apache.http.client.cache' to Import-Package is enough to fix things.. Require-Bundles can stay the same.
Nov 02 15:26:54 <nboldt>	rgrunber: the same package twice?
Nov 02 15:27:22 <rgrunber>	where is the 2nd httpclient though ? 
Nov 02 15:27:41 <nboldt>	you said "org.apache.http.client.cache,org.apache.http.client.cache" 
Nov 02 15:27:48 <nboldt>	did you mean something else?
Nov 02 15:27:50 <rgrunber>	umm...
Nov 02 15:27:58 <rgrunber>	oops org.apache.impl.http.client.cache
Nov 02 15:28:04 <nboldt>	mwaha
Nov 02 15:28:53 <nboldt>	ok, so a one-line change to thym.core?
Nov 02 15:29:25 <rgrunber>	yeah in manifest.. actually now i'm curious why it needs impl.http.client.cache.. hmm
Nov 02 15:29:43 *	nboldt is fetching a clone so I can throw a PR at gercan
Nov 02 15:33:32 <nboldt>	attempting to import thym plugins into devstudio installed via rpm
Nov 02 15:39:20 <nboldt>	rgrunber: does impl.http.client.cache provide HttpParams ?
Nov 02 15:39:44 <nboldt>	can't resolve import org.apache.http.params.HttpParams;
Nov 02 15:40:00 <rgrunber>	no, it does not.
Nov 02 15:40:58 <rgrunber>	org/apache/http/params/HttpParams.class is in httpcore
Nov 02 15:41:15 <rgrunber>	opt/rh/rh-java-common/root/usr/share/java/httpcomponents/httpcore.jar
Nov 02 15:41:33 <nboldt>	I"m getting this/l http://pasteboard.co/muCTnGjxk.png 
Nov 02 15:42:10 <nboldt>	after removing require bundle on org.apache.httpcomponents.httpcore;bundle-version="[4.2.5,4.4.0)
Nov 02 15:42:54 <rgrunber>	because httpcore bundle is provided those.
Nov 02 15:44:06 <rgrunber>	we're not getting rid of httpcore, or httpclient.. we're simply adding yet another one httpclient-cache.
Nov 02 15:44:37 <nboldt>	ah, ok so the PR I'm working on won't work until the rpm is available and installed locally, correct?
Nov 02 15:44:44 <rgrunber>	yes.
Nov 02 15:47:15 <nboldt>	fwiw, I found why org.apache.http.impl.client.cache is needed
Nov 02 15:47:40 <nboldt>	it's in thym/plugins/org.eclipse.thym.core/src/org/eclipse/thym/core/plugin/registry/CordovaPluginRegistryManager.java
Nov 02 15:48:26 <nboldt>	and thym/plugins/org.eclipse.thym.core/src/org/eclipse/thym/core/internal/util/BundleHttpCacheStorage.java
Nov 02 15:49:36 <rgrunber>	yeah i saw.. some Default cache used..
Nov 02 15:49:40 <rgrunber>	and some factory
Nov 02 15:49:46 <nboldt>	yep
Nov 02 16:04:44 <nboldt>	rgrunber: https://github.com/eclipse/thym/pull/68/files something like this? I feel like I'm still missing some imports
Nov 02 16:06:17 <rgrunber>	nboldt: you don't have to convert everything to imports. you could actually keep the httpcore,httpclient requirebundles and only add Import-Package for the stuff in httpclient-cache.
Nov 02 16:06:31 <nboldt>	yeah, but why not?
Nov 02 16:06:50 <nboldt>	might as well migrate everything over now so we don't get bitten again later
Nov 02 16:07:04 <rgrunber>	sure :P i'd just verify you're not forgetting any..
Nov 02 16:07:04 <nboldt>	what packages are in httpclient-cache?
Nov 02 16:07:33 <rgrunber>	any Class.forName anywhere that would get http* ?
Nov 02 16:08:01 <rgrunber>	other than that you would only know when it breaks :P
Nov 02 16:08:32 <nboldt>	hey, found another solution.... forge just bundles shit under the covers:
Nov 02 16:08:33 <nboldt>	./rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/eclipse/droplets/devstudio/eclipse/plugins/org.jboss.tools.forge.runtime_2.0.102.v20161003-1654/addon-repository/org-jboss-forge-addon-git-3-3-2-Final/httpclient-4.3.6.jar
Nov 02 16:08:33 <nboldt>	./rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/eclipse/droplets/devstudio/eclipse/plugins/org.jboss.tools.forge.runtime_2.0.102.v20161003-1654/addon-repository/org-jboss-forge-addon-git-3-3-2-Final/httpcore-4.3.3.jar
Nov 02 16:08:53 <nboldt>	but that no es bueno. another thing to fix eventually :D
Nov 02 16:09:27 <rgrunber>	yeah i saw that.. meh.. Eclipse-BundleShape: dir + Bundle-ClassPath: lib/...
Nov 02 16:09:35 <rgrunber>	kinda common
Nov 02 16:11:44 <nboldt>	yuck
Nov 02 16:26:24 <mbenitez>	nboldt, rgrunber before you leave for the day could you please send a short note on httpclient / lucene status CC akazakov
Nov 02 16:26:42 <mbenitez>	we need this to update people in the morning 5x5
Nov 02 16:26:50 <nboldt>	mbenitez: ok
Nov 02 16:26:56 <rgrunber>	ah, you've got it ?
Nov 02 16:27:21 <mbenitez>	thanks! nothing fancy just a brief explanation on whether we have a fix/workaround or we're blocked
Nov 02 16:27:23 <rgrunber>	nboldt: feel free to reference anything i wrote in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1390760#c2
Nov 02 16:27:24 <nboldt>	rgrunber: I've got nothing exciting happening tonight so I can write up the summary of what's in the various JIRAs
Nov 02 16:27:38 <nboldt>	hell, I can add it to the 5x5 agenda directly and save a step :D
Nov 02 16:28:00 <mbenitez>	nboldt, don't overdo it, don't want you to work extra hours
Nov 02 16:28:13 <mbenitez>	nboldt, great idea that works
Nov 02 16:55:46 <nboldt>	rgrunber: did your patch to disable reconciler on start up get into rhscl yet? or is it only in a scratch build?
Nov 02 16:56:43 <rgrunber>	nboldt: no.. wouldn't have worked. the patch to disable 'uses' which seems to be good isn't in yet either.. we'd need a bug for it + approval as possible z-stream.
Nov 02 16:56:53 <nboldt>	ah, boo
Nov 02 16:57:03 <nboldt>	could we do this patching in the devstudio.spec instead ?
Nov 02 16:58:51 <nboldt>	rgrunber:  and for  JBDS-4150 and RHBZ 1390760 (HttpCacheStorage problem) ... that jar will be in something that rh-eclipse46-base depends on by tomorrow?
Nov 02 16:59:23 <nboldt>	wondering if we'll be able to fix this before EOD tomorrow (code freeze in devstudio)
Nov 02 17:00:56 <rgrunber>	nboldt: the patching for uses-constraint stuff needs to touch platform code so has to be there.
Nov 02 17:01:57 <rgrunber>	for the HttpCacheStorage .. if msimachek does a build it should be in.. not sure how all of that works though.. i guess it'd be a z-stream as well unless it can get in for GA.. but it's so close.
Nov 02 17:02:37 <nboldt>	so... your official answer for the 5x5 status call is "might be fixed before devstudio GA" ?
Nov 02 17:03:15 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: ^ can the fix to rh-java-common-httpcomponents-httpclient have any chance to make it in before GA ?
Nov 02 17:04:21 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, not sure, may be feasible since it's a new pkg but I think what nboldt really needs is a proper build in Brew for tomorrow and that should be doable [just ask in BZ]
Nov 02 17:07:03 <rgrunber>	k asked.
Nov 02 17:07:08 <mbenitez>	thanks
Nov 03 06:18:32 <mistria>	scela: hey
Nov 03 06:18:47 <mistria>	scela: did you publish the slides of ECE's talk somewhere?
Nov 03 06:29:19 <scela>	mistria: not yet
Nov 03 06:29:23 <scela>	mistria: can you do it?
Nov 03 06:29:34 <mistria>	scela: as you wish
Nov 03 06:29:47 <mistria>	scela: is the something better than slideshare?
Nov 03 06:29:59 <scela>	mistria: no idea tbh
Nov 03 06:30:03 <scela>	slideshare should be fine
Nov 03 06:46:50 <mistria>	scela: as I plan to put the slides on the blog, there are big chances that someone complains we didn't use the theme...
Nov 03 06:47:44 <scela>	mistria: we do have the logo in the first page though
Nov 03 06:48:03 <scela>	mistria: maybe martha can say whether it's a problem or not that we don't have it everywhere
Nov 03 06:48:50 <mistria>	scela: let's just not ask and if we're pinged we'll say no-one told us...
Nov 03 06:49:15 <mistria>	scela: ;)
Nov 03 07:01:49 <scela>	mistria: writing it in the team chat is not helping your case ;)
Nov 03 07:03:18 <mistria>	scela: it's full OSS, no peer-to-peer discussion, everything public
Nov 03 07:04:53 <mistria>	scela: Anyway, it's too late to change it, I don't think it's an important issue
Nov 03 07:05:22 <mistria>	scela: let's just be ready for some mails reminding to use the branded template ;)
Nov 03 07:07:37 <scela>	mistria: ok :)
Nov 03 09:01:13 <nboldt>	anyone here use eclipse-cs (Checkstyle) plugin for Eclipse? wondering what happens if we switch from lucene 3.5 to 5.4.1 (JBDS-4133)
Nov 03 09:57:26 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thank you for all the updates for the 5x5 it was helpful to have you around
Nov 03 09:57:37 <nboldt>	mbenitez: no problem :D
Nov 03 09:57:55 <nboldt>	would have spoken up but figured ya'll had it in hand 
Nov 03 10:00:00 <mbenitez>	feel free to do so if you're around and feel we're leaving something out
Nov 03 10:00:45 <nboldt>	well, Tim copies the chat transcript into the minutes so in some ways it's even better to type than speak as there's a more concrete record of it :D
Nov 03 10:23:20 <rgrunber>	akazakov: just an fyi, linuxtools, and orbit hipp seem to have issues afaict. so i'll file a bug..
Nov 03 10:23:24 <rgrunber>	oops.. akurtakov ^
Nov 03 10:23:40 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: ok :)
Nov 03 10:23:55 <rgrunber>	hudson is triggered by gerrit patchset but hudson never reports anything back to gerrit.
Nov 03 10:27:58 <rgrunber>	oh nvm.. they're aware..
Nov 03 10:28:03 <rgrunber>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=506612
Nov 03 10:32:30 <rgrunber>	...annnd gerrit's down
Nov 03 10:34:00 <rgrunber>	, and back to normal.
Nov 03 10:34:13 <nboldt>	man, it's like twitter up in here
Nov 03 10:34:25 <nboldt>	"Bulletins as they happen." :D
Nov 03 10:34:50 <nboldt>	rgrunber: does https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/24321 mean the rpm is built somewhere?
Nov 03 10:35:49 <rgrunber>	should be somewhere.. because https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/buildinfo?buildID=521582
Nov 03 10:36:02 <rgrunber>	'rhscl-2.3-rhel-7-ga-1.1-set'
Nov 03 10:37:41 <nboldt>	ah, sweet
Nov 03 10:40:04 <rgrunber>	according to listing, it's in http://download-node-02.eng.bos.redhat.com/brewroot/repos/rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7-build/latest/x86_64/pkglist
Nov 03 10:40:10 <rgrunber>	just take off 'pkglist' and there's your yum repo
Nov 03 10:40:42 <nboldt>	rgrunber: thanks. so dumb question ... how did you get from the errata page to the brew page? I don't see how they link together
Nov 03 10:42:11 <mbenitez>	nboldt, was about to tell you about errata
Nov 03 10:42:15 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i didn't.. i will usually test against the brew build target.
Nov 03 10:42:41 <mbenitez>	if you see at the bottom of the page comment 68 indicates the builds / bug added
Nov 03 10:43:42 <mbenitez>	you can see the build like Roland said, from bugzilla in the 'Fixed in' field or from errata 'Builds' tab
Nov 03 10:46:14 <rgrunber>	nboldt: so any brew target will have a build tag from which it grabs the packages (with inheritance).. and you can see them all here : http://download-node-02.eng.bos.redhat.com/brewroot/repos/
Nov 03 10:46:35 <nboldt>	ah, but the link to brew in the BZ points to the fc24 build, not the el7 one
Nov 03 10:46:53 <nboldt>	https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/taskinfo?taskID=12002862 vs. https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/buildinfo?buildID=521582
Nov 03 10:48:02 <rgrunber>	nboldt: hmm that could just be how they imported the initial srpm..
Nov 03 10:48:20 <mbenitez>	nboldt, you got me there, there's usually no link to a build from BZ just the NVR in 'Fixed in' from there you'd go look in Brew
Nov 03 10:48:30 <mbenitez>	from errata you'd get the link though
Nov 03 10:49:56 <rgrunber>	the .fc24 one was a scratch build.. 
Nov 03 10:50:18 <rgrunber>	and my guess is it was sent as a .fc24 srpm because it was built on that system.. so the macros evaluated that way.
Nov 03 10:50:43 <rgrunber>	however that isn't too relevant because when you upload an srpm all the macros get re-evaluated and a new one gets generated (see list of srpms in results)
Nov 03 10:52:09 <rgrunber>	nboldt: oh and the initial link was a scratch build.. not the final one.. just something to test out that "it works"
Nov 03 10:53:21 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ah, ok
Nov 04 08:18:45 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: I believe I have a better ECPoint compression patch
Nov 04 08:20:38 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: you mean the one attached to Bugzilla?
Nov 04 08:22:16 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: No I attached a test case that proves you right :-)
Nov 04 08:22:32 <mbooth>	It should pass after I add my new patch
Nov 04 08:23:03 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: what's the plan at this moment?
Nov 04 08:23:25 <vkadlcik>	drop the effor on point compression?
Nov 04 08:23:30 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: ^
Nov 04 08:23:43 <vkadlcik>	s/effor/effort/
Nov 04 08:28:10 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: I dunno, you mean bump the bug to RHSCL 2.4? I'm happy to do that since I think consensus is not a blocker (it shipped in previous releases)
Nov 04 08:29:13 <mbooth>	But at the same time, I had to finish investigating so I didn't have reload my brain with bouncycastle internals in the future -- so I think I am ready to do a brew build with a new patch now
Nov 04 08:29:26 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: yes, that was my suggestion in BZ
Nov 04 08:31:47 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: i would need some time to retest, and since my deadline to finish testing is today, we are out of time, i think :-(
Nov 04 08:33:43 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Okay, no worries. I will open a new bug and change the subject of this one to be about MQV only
Nov 04 08:34:12 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: yes, i like it :-)
Nov 04 08:34:19 <mbooth>	It will be ready and waiting for RHSCL 2.4 :-)
Nov 04 08:36:43 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: ok, once it's limited to MQV, i'll switch the bug to VERIFIED and publish the results
Nov 04 08:43:39 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: New bug is https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1391934
Nov 04 08:45:39 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: thanks!
Nov 04 08:45:45 <mbooth>	np
Nov 04 09:25:08 <mbenitez>	mbooth, hi Mat, when you get a chance please talk to KB about the infocentre details, he's also in #devtools if irc is easier than email
Nov 04 09:26:38 <rgrunber>	scela: btw i've updated that lucene6 repo once again. only thing i changed was did split packaging for .index , .search .store and .util.fst
Nov 04 09:27:51 <rgrunber>	scela: we can probably push today, no objections on cross-project..
Nov 04 09:30:56 <scela>	rgrunber: some more stuff came up from my side which I need to fix
Nov 04 09:31:04 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Sure, thanks
Nov 04 09:31:08 <scela>	rgrunber: akurtakov managed to spot some issues
Nov 04 09:31:18 <rgrunber>	hmm, the build failure ?
Nov 04 09:31:37 <scela>	rgrunber: not that's kind of expected, some porting issues with old and new indexes
Nov 04 09:32:18 <scela>	rgrunber: old indexes getting in the way of creating new indexes. Turns out lucene in order to delete has to read first-> reading will fail with IndexTooOldException -> fun
Nov 04 09:33:27 <scela>	rgrunber: so bottom line I'm not ready yet from my side
Nov 04 09:34:01 <rgrunber>	I was running into similar issues i think.. doesn't parse index of doc plugin built with anything older than 6.1 ?
Nov 04 09:34:28 <scela>	rgrunber: man Lucene 6.2 can't read 6.1 indexes, without extra codec jars
Nov 04 09:34:41 <scela>	rgrunber: so you can imagine 6.1 with 3.5
Nov 04 09:37:57 <rgrunber>	so extra cq for backwards-codecs ?
Nov 04 09:38:52 <scela>	rgrunber: no we're ditching older indexes
Nov 04 09:38:53 <scela>	it will be 6.1 only as it will re-index them from scratch on first run
Nov 04 09:38:53 <scela>	so users would feel the difference only in first run
Nov 04 09:38:58 <scela>	but when this first indexing is done it needs to delete old index first
Nov 04 09:39:15 <scela>	now deleting for Lucene means reading first that it's an index than deleting
Nov 04 09:39:31 <scela>	and the reading part fails with exceptions everywhere 
Nov 04 09:39:50 <scela>	so i'm force-deleting the folder contents and starting with the new index
Nov 04 09:39:59 <scela>	rgrunber: i can go in more details but it's not fun :)
Nov 04 09:40:18 <rgrunber>	k :) don't worry about it i was just curious.
Nov 04 09:41:12 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: btw, you saw the bug about the orbit to be used ?
Nov 04 09:41:32 <akurtakov>	it would be nice if we can feed Sravan with built that contains the new lucene too
Nov 04 09:41:44 <akurtakov>	would make it way simpler for our move to 6.1
Nov 04 09:55:26 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: the nightlies will have it.. could spin an I-build until we have an S-build for M4
Nov 04 09:57:34 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: when he says 'last week of development' he means up until M4+0 ?
Nov 04 09:58:11 <akurtakov>	M4 - 1 I think :)
Nov 04 10:00:11 <scela>	akurtakov: when is M4's last push day?
Nov 04 10:00:28 <rgrunber>	wait.. a week before M4+0 ? M3 is already out..
Nov 04 10:01:13 <akurtakov>	Dec 2
Nov 04 10:01:26 <rgrunber>	to dec 16th for the ramp up.

Nov 04 10:02:53 <akurtakov>	scela: but I would say if we can't push lucene by Nov 25 it would slip this milestone too
Nov 04 10:03:28 <rgrunber>	Orbit Oxygen M4 would release Dec 2nd.
Nov 04 10:03:29 <scela>	akurtakov: so exactly three weeks from now
Nov 04 10:03:35 <akurtakov>	yeah
Nov 04 10:11:47 <nboldt>	akurtakov: rgrunber: scela: are you thinking of changing lucene version in rhscl? or just in orbit for oxygen?
Nov 04 10:12:03 <akurtakov>	nboldt: Oxygen
Nov 04 10:12:19 <akurtakov>	bumping platform.ua 
Nov 04 10:12:40 <nboldt>	ok, cool. no more target platform changes in rhscl until late Dec / early Jan, please :D

Nov 04 10:21:14 <nboldt>	(aside: this is why some people prefer Hipchat to IRC - images load automatically in the channel so memes and jokes are immediate w/o needing to click 'em)
Nov 04 10:21:26 <nboldt>	#productivity
Nov 04 10:21:33 <rgrunber>	Maebe...
Nov 04 10:22:21 <rgrunber>	what we need is a link -> asci image bot
Nov 04 10:23:19 <mbenitez>	haha that's futuristic technology
Nov 04 12:54:27 <mbooth>	scela: :-p
Nov 04 12:54:34 <scela>	mbooth: :)
Nov 04 13:20:26 <rgrunber>	scela: how do you not have gmail but mbooth does ?
Nov 04 13:20:48 <scela>	rgrunber: mbooth is the traitor here, not me
Nov 04 13:21:58 <mbooth>	I couldn't deal with having calendar and email in different places, so opted to switch early back when the calendar migration happened. I use gmail at home, so there was no culture shock for me.
Nov 04 13:22:24 <mbooth>	Okay, I'm ready for the flames :-)
Nov 04 13:22:33 <mbenitez>	good point, once the calendar moved out of zimbra... oh well :(
Nov 04 13:23:12 <akurtakov>	once calendar moved out of zimbra it became unusable to me :)
Nov 04 13:23:15 <mbenitez>	mbooth, we still like you, we even like lufimtse even though he works on Mac :P
Nov 04 13:23:34 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, :) agree
Nov 04 13:23:38 <rgrunber>	mbooth: have you considered using fedora's native calendar ? i really like viewing stuff there.
Nov 04 13:25:10 <scela>	i'm sure there are millions of tools to do all these things. the point is what is wrong with the correct one
Nov 04 13:25:28 <scela>	s/correct/current 
Nov 04 13:25:54 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Oh yeah, at least lufimtse runs Fedora on his mac -- this redeems him ;-)
Nov 04 13:26:05 <lufimtse>	:--3
Nov 04 13:26:14 <mbenitez>	mbooth, that's probably why he survived ;)
Nov 04 13:26:29 <lufimtse>	As of recent, I can even close my lid and do things like shutting down my mac with Fedora. (before it would hang).
Nov 04 13:26:33 <lufimtse>	Fedora 25 is nice.
Nov 04 13:26:39 <lufimtse>	Also got my webcam working.
Nov 04 13:26:46 <lufimtse>	Life is good.
Nov 04 13:26:52 <mbenitez>	lufimtse++
Nov 04 13:27:19 <scela>	lufimtse: next step, run all this on a windows VM in vmware workstation ;)
Nov 04 13:27:37 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I was having some problem with 2FA using the Fedora calendar stuff, but that might be long time ago now... maybe F23-time. I should try that again 
Nov 04 13:27:57 <lufimtse>	scela, :-3, well I do have a tripple boot set up, for those odd situations where I need to see how SWT functions on Windows/OS X compared to Gtk.
Nov 04 13:27:57 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yeah ditto.. i tried in f24.. seems to work.
Nov 04 13:53:45 <mbenitez>	mbooth, that BZ comment is priceless!
Nov 04 14:03:54 <scela>	rgrunber: mbooth lufimtse hey, does one of you have a reasonable latest eclipse handy?
Nov 04 14:04:04 <scela>	i need help with a 2 minute help test
Nov 04 14:04:35 <rgrunber>	scela: i'm running neon.1 .. unless you want oxygen m3.. that i don't have currently..
Nov 04 14:04:47 <scela>	rgrunber: it should be fine
Nov 04 14:04:57 <scela>	can you open Help->help contents
Nov 04 14:05:09 <scela>	rgrunber: do you have SDK?
Nov 04 14:05:57 <rgrunber>	i should have sources for things.. and pde as well..
Nov 04 14:06:10 <scela>	shouldn't be an issue
Nov 04 14:06:25 <scela>	so open help and search for "alphabetically" with quotes
Nov 04 14:06:32 <scela>	you should see 6 matches
Nov 04 14:07:05 <rgrunber>	i see 17
Nov 04 14:07:28 <scela>	rgrunber: you probably have more than SDK then
Nov 04 14:07:31 <rgrunber>	but i do have web tools installed as well..
Nov 04 14:07:37 <scela>	hm ok
Nov 04 14:08:28 <scela>	rgrunber: can you skim and make sure that Accelerator Sets is not one of the topics (the hit title)
Nov 04 14:08:45 <rgrunber>	could have sworn i saw it.. one sec
Nov 04 14:10:04 <rgrunber>	Accelerator Sets from Extension Points Reference
Nov 04 14:10:20 <rgrunber>	... ' they will be alphabetically sorted by the plugin id.'
Nov 04 14:11:00 <scela>	rgrunber: nice thanks
Nov 04 14:16:08 <rgrunber>	scela: ok so i just tried on a fresh Neon.1 SDK
Nov 04 14:16:26 <rgrunber>	scela: 6 results, no Accelerator Sets
Nov 04 14:16:50 <scela>	rgrunber: yeah that's what I was expecting
Nov 04 14:17:00 <scela>	what if you do search explicitly for Accelerator Sets?
Nov 04 14:17:32 <rgrunber>	yeah found it and 'alphabetically' string
Nov 04 14:17:56 <rgrunber>	so upstream with lucene 3 has a bug that Fedora Neon.1 + lucene fixes.. ?
Nov 04 14:18:03 <scela>	rgrunber: yep. Present search is way more broken than people think
Nov 04 14:18:24 <scela>	rgrunber: with my changes it found it so I was a bit surprised 
Nov 04 14:18:36 <rgrunber>	good kind of surprise :)
Nov 04 14:18:42 <scela>	rgrunber: as usually if there is a mismatch i faulted my code but now there is an added complexity
Nov 04 14:18:59 <scela>	as there is really no more reference to check whether it is 'right'
Nov 04 14:19:13 <scela>	as obviously present help with lucene 3.5 is broken
Nov 04 14:19:38 <scela>	and it's the same also for wildcard searches, try alp?abeti?ally
Nov 04 14:20:10 <rgrunber>	6 mathces..
Nov 04 14:20:12 <scela>	rgrunber: that's because they use the same indexed field called exact_contents
Nov 04 14:20:46 <scela>	and if you click one of the results you'll see some funny highlighting
Nov 04 14:21:11 <scela>	which are basically the matches tokenized on the ?
Nov 04 14:21:26 <rgrunber>	also help contents window keeps crashing eclipse in libwebkitgtk
Nov 04 14:21:39 <rgrunber>	crashed it once locally, and once on my work machine..
Nov 04 14:21:55 <scela>	 Fedora Neon.1 + lucene has my patches that's why it works
Nov 04 14:22:01 <scela>	mbooth: backported it i think
Nov 04 14:22:27 <scela>	rgrunber: anyway thanks for the test
Nov 04 14:22:59 <rgrunber>	np
Nov 04 14:53:05 <lufimtse>	scela, I have today's nightly
Nov 04 14:53:17 <lufimtse>	I keep up to date with nightlies.
Nov 04 14:57:16 <scela>	lufimtse: thanks. i went through it with rgrunber already
Nov 04 14:57:49 <scela>	lufimtse: but you can quickly test also to make sure that Neon.1 SDK is in the wrong here
Nov 04 14:58:08 <scela>	lufimtse: <scela> so open help and search for "alphabetically" with quotes
Nov 04 14:58:23 <scela>	<scela> you should see 6 matches
Nov 04 15:02:04 <lufimtse>	scela, http://i.imgur.com/idMq673.png
Nov 04 15:02:04 <mbenitez>	lufimtse, I can approve expenses if they come out of your bonus
Nov 04 15:02:27 <mbenitez>	#sarcasmGoneWrong ;)
Nov 04 15:03:33 <scela>	lufimtse: that's not sdk right?
Nov 04 15:04:04 <lufimtse>	scela, http://i.imgur.com/3bX0YEQ.png
Nov 04 15:04:18 <lufimtse>	Today's nightly.
Nov 04 15:04:45 <scela>	lufimtse: yeah it's a 'decorated' sdk
Nov 04 15:04:46 <scela>	with c++ and stuff
Nov 04 15:05:10 <rgrunber>	nightlies ship CDT.. and packagekit stuff.. or i think it's just update site content..
Nov 04 15:05:13 <scela>	mbenitez: first class please
Nov 04 15:05:16 <rgrunber>	^ meant as question
Nov 04 15:05:22 <lufimtse>	:-3
Nov 04 15:05:42 <mbenitez>	scela, noted :D
Nov 04 15:05:42 <rgrunber>	either way there's no "Accelerator"
Nov 04 15:05:43 <scela>	rgrunber: not platform nightlies
Nov 04 15:06:15 <scela>	rgrunber: platform sdk is just PDE, JDT and the underlying stuff IIRC
Nov 04 15:21:37 <nboldt>	hey, dumb question... https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1390760 = "fixed in RHSCL" or "only in a brew build" ?
Nov 04 15:22:03 <nboldt>	my guess is "fixed in RHSCL because it's in the Errata and ON_QA, but this new language is ... um, new.
Nov 04 15:22:13 <mbenitez>	nboldt, good guess
Nov 04 15:22:37 <nboldt>	mbenitez: ok, cool. just keeping tabs on the pile of open issues for devstudio rpm
Nov 04 15:22:38 <mbenitez>	once in errata a build is pretty much ready to be shipped
Nov 04 15:22:45 <nboldt>	(and trying not to find/open new ones)
Nov 04 15:22:54 <mbenitez>	nboldt, np! thanks for making sure all is moving fwd :)
Nov 04 15:23:01 <mbenitez>	haha
Nov 04 15:23:32 <mbenitez>	nboldt, tbh I expect new issues may still arise, as long as we keep moving in the right direction
Nov 04 15:24:04 <mbenitez>	good thing is we cleared the scheduling issue yesterday and we don't need to work 24x7 until this ships
Nov 04 15:24:53 <nboldt>	so of the 7 items on 5x5 call, we have 2 fixed in TP update AFTER AM3 is done, one blocked by Ilya being on PTO, startup hack from Roland is ... ???, and thym/httpclientcache thing is fixed in SCL, will be fixed after AM3 in Thym. That just leaves the AERI bug (which is not a blocker so has been punted to 10.x)
Nov 04 15:25:29 <nboldt>	aaand... I found a new one :(
Nov 04 15:26:29 <rgrunber>	nboldt: re startup hack. i'll file the bug.. since it changes platform build needs to be in rhbz.
Nov 04 15:26:51 <mbenitez>	nboldt, see? that's why you shouldn't say there won't be more, you jinx it ;)
Nov 04 15:27:33 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, nboldt that's the fix that would need a zstream right, but really improves the startup time?
Nov 04 15:27:56 <rgrunber>	i would stay drastically.. and very worth it.
Nov 04 15:28:06 <nboldt>	4 mins or 14 seconds. 
Nov 04 15:28:12 <nboldt>	bit of an improvement :D
Nov 04 15:28:24 <nboldt>	and fixes startup time after updates too
Nov 04 15:28:46 <nboldt>	so, yeah, it's pretty much the difference between "usable" and "screw this, I'll use sublime"
Nov 04 15:29:14 <nboldt>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4162?jql=project%20%3D%20JBDS%20AND%20component%20%3D%20rpm%20and%20resolution%20%3D%20null is the new issue - another issue related to slf4j
Nov 04 15:29:15 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, just make sure to file the bug and I'll get the approvals
Nov 04 15:30:38 <nboldt>	and as there's nothing else I can fix/test/break at the moment, it's time to start on the devstudio release to QE. Only 6 hours later than I wanted :(
Nov 04 15:32:56 <nboldt>	btw, I've added a component in JBDS JIRA called "rhscl" so we can more easily find issues which rely on an upstream fix in rhscl..
Nov 04 15:32:58 <nboldt>	https://issues.jboss.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20JBDS%20AND%20component%20%3D%20rpm%20and%20resolution%20%3D%20null%20and%20component%20in%20(rhscl)

Nov 04 15:34:29 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: you missed a / there
Nov 04 15:34:34 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thanks for that filter! I wanted something like that :)
Nov 04 15:35:01 <nboldt>	haven't added that component retroactively for stuff that's already closed but I could if there's a need
Nov 04 15:37:19 <mbenitez>	no need, current issues is fine
Nov 04 15:55:19 <scela>	mbenitez: it seems there are quite some -2s for gmail switch
Nov 04 15:55:52 <mbenitez>	scela, we expected that to be the case
Nov 04 15:56:10 <rgrunber>	scela: i mean technically i 
Nov 04 15:56:18 <rgrunber>	*i'll take gmail over actual eye stabbing.
Nov 04 15:56:45 <mbenitez>	this change is not something we are lobbying for, it is coming from upper management and we need to figure out what can be done
Nov 04 15:56:46 <rgrunber>	i'm still not decided whether i'm a 0 or a -1
Nov 04 15:57:00 <scela>	rgrunber: why not -2 ;)
Nov 04 15:57:01 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, good point
Nov 04 15:58:01 <rgrunber>	scela: the change has already been made, i probably won't see any benefit (in fact i'll be reading how to work around most issues).. but maybe if X workers don't have to administrate email internally it's worth it or however much money we save.
Nov 04 15:58:16 <rgrunber>	*made in the sense that associates start with gmail..
Nov 04 15:59:45 <scela>	rgrunber: the cost thing is speculation until we have proof of the contrary
Nov 04 15:59:53 <scela>	rgrunber: and it's very difficult to calculate
Nov 04 16:01:47 <scela>	anyway I'm out as it was a pretty long friday, see you next week
Nov 04 16:09:41 *	nboldt switched to gmail as soon as it was possible.
Nov 04 16:10:13 <nboldt>	other than the shitty way gmail does filters (apply all of them, no 'stop processing filters' option) it's still way less horrible than zimbra & thunderbird
Nov 04 16:10:42 <rgrunber>	nboldt: do you still do gmail imap + thunderbird?
Nov 04 16:11:14 <nboldt>	no, I trashed thunderbird as soon as I didn't need it anymore. I do mail in chrome and on my phone now
Nov 04 16:11:36 <nboldt>	I was *very* happy to be done with t'bird
Nov 04 16:12:24 <nboldt>	also love having google calendar instead of zimbra for that... much easier to use, and works on all my devices too

Nov 07 11:03:50 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: i'm waiting to push. looks like git needs time to see the newly added flags..
Nov 07 11:04:56 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, ok, makes sense, if it doesn't work after lunch, I'll ask around to see what's missing
Nov 07 11:06:06 <rgrunber>	it's showing rhbz#1392095 as unapproved and shows (pm_ack+) beside it.. my guess is it thinks that's currently missing.. hope it's just slow.
Nov 07 11:07:12 <mbenitez>	probably
Nov 07 11:07:34 <mbenitez>	unless we need something else for the zstream... let's wait and see
Nov 07 11:07:50 <rgrunber>	remote: *** Current checkin policy requires:
Nov 07 11:07:50 <rgrunber>	remote:     rhscl-2.3.0 == +
Nov 07 11:07:59 <rgrunber>	which i assume the z stream flag satisfies..
Nov 07 11:22:39 <scela>	rgrunber: so I have a patch which should be acceptable to merge
Nov 07 11:23:01 <scela>	rgrunber: i had it tested by akurtakov and his weird setups and it seems to hold the pressure
Nov 07 11:23:13 <scela>	rgrunber: there's still the code review to be done but in principle it is fine
Nov 07 11:23:33 <scela>	rgrunber: we are targeting to merge after the next I-build
Nov 07 11:23:40 <scela>	which should be either late Tue or early Wed
Nov 07 11:23:51 <rgrunber>	scela: ok so i can push lucene and give you an I-build for now to reference.
Nov 07 11:24:15 <rgrunber>	until we release an S-build (for M4)
Nov 07 11:24:58 <akurtakov>	that should be good enough
Nov 07 11:25:17 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: scela: please refer to it in the bug for the orbit change
Nov 07 11:25:32 <rgrunber>	will do
Nov 07 11:25:36 <akurtakov>	and I'll go on with what's needed for the target platform change
Nov 07 11:29:15 <scela>	rgrunber: akurtakov will the gerrit build be able to pick up the new lucene bundles?
Nov 07 11:29:57 <akurtakov>	scela: I don't think so as lucene versions would still be fixed in the target platform
Nov 07 11:30:30 <rgrunber>	yeah.. you'd have to change the tp for platform.ua
Nov 07 11:31:25 <scela>	then I'll have to test the build locally as it's too risky a change to merge without having a build
Nov 07 11:55:20 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: i think i need rhscl-2.3.0 + .. and it's ignoring the rhscl-2.3.z
Nov 07 11:55:23 <rgrunber>	https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1001170
Nov 07 12:04:45 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, zstream's are different, but I don't remember if we need a branch
Nov 07 12:05:09 <mbenitez>	I asked in #softwarecollections feel free to monitor there too
Nov 07 12:14:50 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, issue is indeed the commit policy, jorton suggested as a temp workaround to add the 2.3.0 ? flag now
Nov 07 12:14:56 <mbenitez>	ack should be in place shortly
Nov 07 12:15:25 <mbenitez>	fyi this should work straight fwd in a few days, we're just doing zstream work early
Nov 07 12:20:20 <rgrunber>	k
Nov 07 12:22:59 <rgrunber>	scela: you can try against http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/N-builds/N20161107170311/repository/ .. i'll build an I-build of that and move it soon..
Nov 07 12:27:53 <scela>	rgrunber: that works if I add it as a p2 site, replacing your fedorapeople link
Nov 07 12:29:15 <rgrunber>	yeah, it should work the same.
Nov 07 14:03:53 <rgrunber>	did anyone read https://mailman.cs.umd.edu/pipermail/findbugs-discuss/2016-November/004321.html (heard from Omair)
Nov 07 15:32:01 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: i still don't have the 2.3.0+ .. but i'll continue to check every now and then.
Nov 07 15:33:34 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, just saw that :( I'll ask pm to add it, seems the bot is not working
Nov 07 15:41:18 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: jjohnstn 'gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-m64'
Nov 07 15:41:25 <rgrunber>	oops.. i meant mbooth..
Nov 07 15:42:26 <mbenitez>	:)
Nov 07 16:49:08 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, ack is in place now, hopefully that works :)
Nov 07 16:50:25 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: k pushing...
Nov 07 16:50:48 <rgrunber>	whoo approved.
Nov 07 16:57:05 <mbenitez>	nice!
Nov 08 09:44:46 <rgrunber>	mbooth: thanks for taking care of cdt.
Nov 08 09:45:17 <mbooth>	rgrunber: No problem -- sorry I missed your messages on IRC yesterday
Nov 08 09:45:46 <rgrunber>	mbooth: np i saw you kick off a build with a bunch of updates and figured that would probably fix stuff. (was working with Jeff to untag some things for the bootstrap)
Nov 08 09:45:56 <rgrunber>	then it failed on gcc -m64 ?!
Nov 08 09:46:16 <mbooth>	Yeah that is not a valid aarch64 compiler flag :-/
Nov 08 09:46:32 <mbooth>	I changed it to accept %{optflags}

Nov 09 04:47:06 <akurtakov_>	mistria: I had spend a lot of effort to get it to clean state http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/N20161109-0310/testResults.php and that is the single offender now :)
Nov 09 04:47:06 <mistria>	akurtakov_: it's IMO an example of why all warning should be marked as error and configured to fail the build
Nov 09 04:47:25 <akurtakov_>	well, enable it in the ide
Nov 09 04:47:47 <akurtakov_>	I have bigger fights than that now 
Nov 09 04:47:57 <akurtakov_>	we are killing I-builds
Nov 09 04:48:11 <mistria>	akurtakov_: I configured the IDE to report most warnings as errors, but the setting here is part of the committed .settings
Nov 09 04:48:21 <akurtakov_>	so edit them
Nov 09 04:48:26 <mistria>	akurtakov_: so whatever I set, project specific settings decide of the criticity
Nov 09 04:48:27 <akurtakov_>	and commit the new ones
Nov 09 04:48:38 <mistria>	akurtakov_: am I allowed to commit whatever project settings?
Nov 09 04:48:52 <mistria>	akurtakov_: I thought those has to be common to all bundles?
Nov 09 04:49:00 <akurtakov_>	mistria: whatever might raise people complaining
Nov 09 04:49:13 <akurtakov_>	but e.g. in this case raise it to error for the project
Nov 09 04:49:18 <akurtakov_>	and commit it
Nov 09 04:49:36 <akurtakov_>	I would fight with everyone who tries to question such change
Nov 09 04:49:45 <akurtakov_>	and no they don't have to be the same
Nov 09 04:49:53 <akurtakov_>	many bundles have different settings
Nov 09 04:50:24 <akurtakov_>	mistria: one step at a time :)
Nov 09 04:51:32 <akurtakov_>	mistria: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/PMC that might be interesting to you too
Nov 09 04:51:55 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: would you please guide scela on how to use infocenter ? you're it's master
Nov 09 04:52:18 <mistria>	akurtakov_: I'm too binary to like the "warning" report level. To me it's either acceptable or not, if not acceptable then it's an error ;)
Nov 09 05:17:59 <akurtakov_>	mistria: the only time when I like warnings is when you initially enable it and work towards fixing them so you can go incrementally without breaking the build
Nov 09 07:28:09 <mbooth>	scela: Infocentre?
Nov 09 07:29:02 <scela>	mbooth: hey
Nov 09 07:29:40 <scela>	mbooth: so I have the o.e.help.webapp bundle and o.e.h.infocenter-feature
Nov 09 07:29:52 <scela>	how can I test them?
Nov 09 07:30:08 <scela>	theoretically the declare dep on o.e.h.base which is already tested
Nov 09 07:33:11 <mbooth>	scela: So you want to just run the webapp?
Nov 09 07:36:07 <scela>	mbooth: i guess so. i've never played with infocenter before so if 'testing infocenter' means run the webapp that should be it.
Nov 09 07:46:17 <mbooth>	scela: Let me whip up a quick example
Nov 09 08:58:35 <nboldt>	mbooth: do you know who build the abrt stuff in Fedora/RHEL? Asking because https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4146
Nov 09 08:59:22 <nboldt>	looksl ike o.e.epp.logging.aeri.ide rpm has a change in the manifest which makes it incompatible w/ lucene/aeri
Nov 09 09:13:05 <akurtakov_>	nboldt: what exactly do you look for ?
Nov 09 09:13:09 <akurtakov_>	eclipse-abrt authors ?
Nov 09 09:14:06 <nboldt>	akurtakov_: details here: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4146?focusedCommentId=13319278&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13319278
Nov 09 09:14:07 <akurtakov_>	fwiw, eclipse-abrt doesn't care about the lucene stuff at all
Nov 09 09:14:33 <nboldt>	problem is not abrt but epp-logging
Nov 09 09:14:34 <akurtakov_>	as it decides on components and etc. based on rpm thus uses only the extension point 
Nov 09 09:14:58 <nboldt>	yeah, but I was wrong about the abrt thing. that was jmaury's idea
Nov 09 09:15:45 <nboldt>	the problem is really the one I mention in my comment in the JIRA -- we have a patch to the epp logging plugin to make it work with lucene 5.4.1 and apparently it doesn't actually work :D
Nov 09 09:15:47 <akurtakov_>	in that case I'll leave it to mbooth to deal with :)
Nov 09 09:16:01 <akurtakov_>	scela: ^ or maybe you could help?
Nov 09 09:16:06 <nboldt>	akurtakov_: sure but we're WAY past code freeze here. can we even get this fixed in time ?
Nov 09 09:16:21 <nboldt>	mbooth: need your help on https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4146?focusedCommentId=13319278&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13319278
Nov 09 09:17:35 <akurtakov_>	nboldt: tbh, there is code freeze somewhere every second day, it's beyond my capability to remember them even :)
Nov 09 09:18:09 <mbooth>	nboldt: Hmm, we don't have lucene 3 in the SCL.
Nov 09 09:18:38 <mbooth>	scela: Can lucene 4 or 5 be made to read lucene 3 indexes?
Nov 09 09:19:15 <nboldt>	mbooth: I don't know. currently an error is thrown when you use epp from rpm and lucene 5.4.1, even with your patch to change come methods
Nov 09 09:19:48 *	scela reads through
Nov 09 09:19:52 <nboldt>	errors and details in the jira. I can open a RH BZ but wanted to discuss what we can do to fix this before hand
Nov 09 09:20:05 <akurtakov_>	https://lucene.apache.org/core/5_3_0/MIGRATE.html
Nov 09 09:20:13 <scela>	mbooth: 5 no
Nov 09 09:20:21 <mbooth>	nboldt: Because it's downloading lucene 3 indexes from random some places on the Internet and IIRC Lucene 5 dropped compat with lucene 3 by default
Nov 09 09:21:09 <nboldt>	mbooth: "random place" is ctrlflow, the company that developed AERI and supports us using their service to report errors
Nov 09 09:21:17 <nboldt>	aka Marcel Bruch
Nov 09 09:22:12 <mbooth>	nboldt: This is probably a duplicate of https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1389302 
Nov 09 09:24:11 <scela>	nboldt: mbooth so lucene 4 should read L3 indexes, but L5 can not read L3 indexes
Nov 09 09:24:19 <scela>	the only way around it is to reindex
Nov 09 09:25:16 <scela>	that is to have the people who are supplying the index re-index it using L5 libraries and then supply it
Nov 09 09:25:24 <scela>	or reindex from source directly
Nov 09 09:28:04 <nboldt>	so you're saying our best bet here is to get Marcel Bruch and the AERI/CrtlFlow guys to fix this file? https://aer.ctrlflow.com/downloads/redhat/problems.zip
Nov 09 09:28:11 <nboldt>	scela: ^
Nov 09 09:29:16 <mbooth>	No, probably make epp-logging in the SCL use lucene 4
Nov 09 09:29:33 <scela>	nboldt: i can tell the zip contains a 3 index, so unless you have lucene [3,4] available, that is the only bet
Nov 09 09:29:57 <scela>	mbooth: yeah 4 should be able to read it
Nov 09 09:30:47 <scela>	mbenitez: meeting in 30 mins or 1hr 30mins this week?
Nov 09 09:30:59 <akurtakov_>	1:30
Nov 09 09:31:04 <akurtakov_>	or I'll have to skip it :)
Nov 09 09:31:22 <scela>	akurtakov_: you never get them right, i'll wait for mbenitez ;)
Nov 09 09:31:38 <akurtakov_>	scela: haah, so true :)
Nov 09 09:31:42 <mbooth>	I think north america should have joined the rest of us in not-summer-time now :-)
Nov 09 09:32:04 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yes time is not summer.. weather is a different story.
Nov 09 09:32:50 <mbooth>	rgrunber: It's snowed here today for the first time this year -- do we have your weather?
Nov 09 09:33:17 <rgrunber>	mbooth: seems that way.
Nov 09 09:37:07 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Cups of tea are starting to get cold before I get to the bottom. Might have to put the heating on :-/
Nov 09 09:38:14 <rgrunber>	mbooth: the fact that you used tea of all things as a reference point is what makes that funny.
Nov 09 09:39:29 <rgrunber>	oh and if anyone notices slow downloads off eclipse, its eclip.se/497732 yet again.
Nov 09 09:40:05 <scela>	rgrunber: would really like some nice weather. in the netherlands we have 'what am I doing with my life' weather
Nov 09 09:42:12 <scela>	rgrunber: yeah I have an aggregator build running and i'm fetching at 1-2 KB/s
Nov 09 10:27:30 <akurtakov_>	mistria: would you please see what Markus has against the visible ctab thingy :)
Nov 09 10:27:33 <rgrunber>	mbooth: not to get your hopes up.. but yeah i wanna get your hopes up.. i think i've found how to reproduce that annoying workbench.xmi bug.
Nov 09 10:27:52 <rgrunber>	lemme just try a few times to confirm.
Nov 09 10:28:00 <mbooth>	rgrunber: \o/
Nov 09 10:36:08 <mistria>	akurtakov_: he seems surprised that theme doesn't apply when it's disabled ;)
Nov 09 10:41:36 <akurtakov_>	mistria: ?
Nov 09 10:42:45 <akurtakov_>	heh 
Nov 09 10:50:07 *	akurtakov_ couldn't resisted :)
Nov 09 10:51:04 <mistria>	akurtakov_: :)
Nov 09 10:52:35 <akurtakov_>	we have a saying in bulgaria " (throwing)  your stones at  your head"
Nov 09 10:52:59 <akurtakov_>	mistria: can you reproduce what he wrote
Nov 09 10:53:11 <akurtakov_>	cause I can't 
Nov 09 10:53:13 <mistria>	akurtakov_: yes, I think I do
Nov 09 10:53:27 <akurtakov_>	or maybe I don't understand his "perfect" english 
Nov 09 10:53:38 <mistria>	akurtakov: it's a 1px wide line which disappears when focus is out
Nov 09 10:53:46 <mistria>	it's quite difficult to perceive it
Nov 09 10:53:55 <akurtakov_>	doh I saw it
Nov 09 10:54:07 <mistria>	I'm not sure if he wants it to remain or to fully disappear on all edges
Nov 09 10:55:18 <akurtakov_>	I would vote for all to disappear :)
Nov 09 10:55:35 <mistria>	akurtakov_: yes, I think so
Nov 09 10:55:39 <akurtakov_>	I dislike these 1px white lines everywhere
Nov 09 10:55:42 <akurtakov_>	so propose that
Nov 09 10:55:53 <akurtakov_>	and if we agree let's handle it via different bug

Nov 09 12:20:42 <ipun>	thanks mistria!
Nov 09 12:57:23 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: what's that source lookup thing called? PDE Source Search Thingamabob?
Nov 09 12:57:45 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: https://github.com/fbricon/pde.source.lookup
Nov 09 13:51:26 <mbenitez>	jjohnstn, when you get a chance could you please look at the rpmdiff results for apache-jasper? https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/25489/rpmdiff_runs
Nov 09 13:52:14 <rgrunber>	mbooth: scela so the workbench.xmi stuff seems to crap out because a @PostConstruct in org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench on the code path to load stuff never gets called, and an NPE is hit. The reason @PostConstruct isn't called seems to be because in Fedora Eclipse a bunch of the e4.ui.workbench plugins import javax.annoation from the javax.annotation-api 1.2.0 that we ship. In Eclipse Upstream everything 
Nov 09 13:52:20 <rgrunber>	gets it from the system osgi bundle and not the shipped javax.annotation.
Nov 09 13:53:26 <rgrunber>	^ in Fedora Eclipse there's 2 places to get javax.annoation and likely the combination leads to it not being called.
Nov 09 13:53:49 <rgrunber>	(actually there's 2 places even upstream but everything is well behaved in upstream eclipse)

Nov 10 10:29:01 <akurtakov>	ipun: ok, if you don't find fix today let lufimtse revert your patch so we have tomorrows build back to working until you figure it out
Nov 10 10:29:07 <rgrunber>	scela: well this is weird but i swear that simply remotely debugging a java application and hitting yes for switching perspective makes the next startup of eclipse run equinox+reconciler stuff
Nov 10 10:29:15 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, something broke?
Nov 10 10:29:26 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: dnd on f26 :)
Nov 10 10:29:34 <lufimtse>	Wooooot
Nov 10 10:29:35 <lufimtse>	darn it.
Nov 10 10:29:50 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: so none of you runs f26 ?
Nov 10 10:29:56 <akurtakov>	with gnome ?
Nov 10 10:30:00 <scela>	rgrunber: it's probably in a weird state
Nov 10 10:30:01 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, f26?
Nov 10 10:30:08 <scela>	rgrunber: tried resetting the perspective?
Nov 10 10:30:11 <akurtakov>	Fedora 26
Nov 10 10:30:16 <lufimtse>	Fedora 26?
Nov 10 10:30:23 <lufimtse>	I tohught 25 isn't even out yet
Nov 10 10:30:29 <ipun>	it isnt :)
Nov 10 10:30:30 <lufimtse>	man, you're on the bleeding edge of things.
Nov 10 10:30:51 <rgrunber>	scela: i'll try but i wonder is the annotation screwup because of equinox re-wiring things.. or has that already happened and all this is just the initial error carried forward..
Nov 10 10:30:58 <akurtakov>	so should you
Nov 10 10:31:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, are you on F26?
Nov 10 10:31:12 <akurtakov>	ipun:  as you're supposed to work on wayland
Nov 10 10:31:27 <akurtakov>	doh f25 :)
Nov 10 10:31:33 <akurtakov>	I should take a break :)
Nov 10 10:31:39 <akurtakov>	the one in beta now
Nov 10 10:31:41 <ipun>	wait what
Nov 10 10:31:43 <ipun>	oh
Nov 10 10:31:46 <ipun>	im on f25
Nov 10 10:31:55 <scela>	rgrunber: it could very well be as symptom rather than a cause
Nov 10 10:32:09 <ipun>	hahaha akurtakov i thought you were on some alpha 26
Nov 10 10:32:29 <scela>	rgrunber: especially since it's not reproducible all the time
Nov 10 10:32:30 <akurtakov>	nevermind, too many things simultaneously leads to that :)
Nov 10 10:33:11 <ipun>	okay, well in that case dnd seems to work fine on my end with the nightly build. lufimtse could you test please?
Nov 10 10:33:23 <rgrunber>	yeah, i'm gonna try seeing what files it "thinks" have been touched that would trigger reconciler to re-run.
Nov 10 10:33:33 <scela>	ok
Nov 10 10:33:45 <rgrunber>	very strange bug.
Nov 10 10:34:53 <akurtakov>	ipun: hmm not working for me
Nov 10 10:36:43 <akurtakov>	ipun: anything extraordinarty with your setup ?
Nov 10 10:37:16 <akurtakov>	ipun: fwiw, reverted your commit and dnd is back to working
Nov 10 10:37:32 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: could you please download latest nightly and try whether dnd works?
Nov 10 10:37:43 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: sure
Nov 10 10:38:39 <lufimtse>	investigating...
Nov 10 10:38:48 <lufimtse>	when I tested the patch, it worked on my system hmm.
Nov 10 10:49:31 <lufimtse>	Hmm, DnD works on my system with Ian's patch
Nov 10 10:49:33 <lufimtse>	hmmmmm
Nov 10 10:49:40 <lufimtse>	Let me do a full system update.
Nov 10 10:49:44 <lufimtse>	on X11.
Nov 10 10:49:59 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Do you mean X11 desktop, or Wayland desktop with Eclipse in X11 mode?
Nov 10 10:50:09 <akurtakov>	X11 desktop
Nov 10 10:53:23 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: seems to work for me on F24 x11.. i mean i don't see any guide when i'm about to drop showing where it'll go but that was always a bit uncertain.
Nov 10 10:53:48 <lufimtse>	I can't reproduce DnD issue on my f25/x11 with Ian's patch
Nov 10 10:54:15 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, can you think of anything on your system that could potentially cause trouble?

Nov 10 11:02:55 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: nope
Nov 10 11:03:47 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, what version of Eclipse are you on?
Nov 10 11:04:03 <akurtakov>	4.7 N20161109-0310
Nov 10 11:04:06 <lufimtse>	I'm Build id: N20161109-0310 <<
Nov 10 11:04:09 <lufimtse>	same.
Nov 10 11:04:16 <lufimtse>	DnD works here. Hmmmmm
Nov 10 11:06:55 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: and dnd works inside this eclipse ?
Nov 10 11:08:57 <lufimtse>	yes
Nov 10 11:09:07 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, do you use something that's not a mouse?
Nov 10 11:09:11 <lufimtse>	like graphics tablet?
Nov 10 11:09:25 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: just touchpad on the laptop
Nov 10 11:09:30 <akurtakov_>	but I tried also with mouse
Nov 10 11:09:44 <akurtakov_>	funny enough dnd works in all other apps
Nov 10 11:09:51 <lufimtse>	meh
Nov 10 11:09:52 <ipun>	that is so wierd...
Nov 10 11:09:55 <lufimtse>	works on my trackpad
Nov 10 11:10:43 <ipun>	akurtakov_ could you do a webm and attach it to the bug? Im curious if its timing out or just not doing the d&d at all
Nov 10 11:12:41 <akurtakov_>	ipun: https://akurtakov.fedorapeople.org/screencast1.webm
Nov 10 11:12:53 <akurtakov_>	does it help ?
Nov 10 11:13:28 <akurtakov_>	as you can see focus changes when I'm supposed to be dragging
Nov 10 11:13:34 <akurtakov_>	whatever that means to you
Nov 10 11:15:38 <ipun>	akurtakov_ very odd behavior, could you do one more test but on dndexample? I wanna see what is being fired off
Nov 10 11:16:37 <akurtakov_>	that's easy
Nov 10 11:16:39 <akurtakov_>	nothing :)
Nov 10 11:17:53 <akurtakov_>	ipun: https://akurtakov.fedorapeople.org/screencast2.webm
Nov 10 11:18:08 <ipun>	wow
Nov 10 11:18:47 <akurtakov_>	ipun: if you want I can show you that dnd works elsewhere :)
Nov 10 11:18:57 <ipun>	akurtakov_ sure
Nov 10 11:20:31 <akurtakov_>	ipun: https://akurtakov.fedorapeople.org/screencast3.webm
Nov 10 11:23:32 <ipun>	akurtakov_ i'm going to safely assume the issue is being caused by OS.g_main_context_iteration (), but its wierd cause it doesn't do that on my system nor lufimtse's
Nov 10 11:24:01 <ipun>	i wasnt able to get it working without using that call for the fix
Nov 10 11:24:03 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, did you install any mouse drivers btw?
Nov 10 11:24:13 <akurtakov_>	nope
Nov 10 11:25:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, to clarify, if you launch a child eclipse with the patch, the issue occurs. If you launch a child eclipse with one commit before the patch, the issue doesn't occur. Is this correct?
Nov 10 11:25:25 <akurtakov_>	yes
Nov 10 11:26:39 <akurtakov_>	fwiw, it seems to fail on line 2497
Nov 10 11:26:48 <akurtakov_>	as eventPtr is always 0
Nov 10 11:26:56 <akurtakov_>	thus no drag begin is detected
Nov 10 11:28:24 <ipun>	akurtakov_ makes sense. the g_main_context_iteration must be doing something to it to break out and also not return a true statement
Nov 10 11:36:29 <lufimtse>	ipun, clicking does feel a little bit off with this nightly
Nov 10 11:36:43 <lufimtse>	like sometimes you click on an 'x', and nothing happens
Nov 10 11:36:45 <lufimtse>	have to click again.
Nov 10 11:38:26 <akurtakov_>	guys, please revert this patch
Nov 10 11:40:40 <mbenitez>	lufimtse, Canadian holidays calendar https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/en.canadian%23holiday%40group.v.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics
Nov 10 11:40:56 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: which part of your patch was introduced in Java 1.6 ?
Nov 10 11:41:10 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, sec.
Nov 10 11:43:49 <lufimtse>	getBytes(Charset charset).  But after some digging around I see that getBytes(String charsetName) been around since 1.1. (1.1:String -> 1.6:Charset). And internally the String method seems to call charset now.
Nov 10 11:44:06 <lufimtse>	Technically it seems that this could have been implemented all the way back in jdk 1.1
Nov 10 11:44:59 <akurtakov_>	that's what I thought
Nov 10 11:45:02 <lufimtse>	not sure why they opted for native methods.
Nov 10 11:45:12 <lufimtse>	Maybe convienience at the time.
Nov 10 11:45:13 <akurtakov_>	let's not touch this for now
Nov 10 11:45:26 <akurtakov_>	please concentrate on finishing webkit2
Nov 10 11:47:01 <lufimtse>	I was sort of using that for the webkit stuff, but I suppose it's ok to postpone this till later.
Nov 10 11:47:31 <akurtakov_>	if the result of the converter method calls doesn't change it shouldn't matter, right?
Nov 10 11:50:14 <akurtakov_>	I'm leaving now but I count on the patch being reverted so the nightly build is fine tomorrow
Nov 10 11:53:41 <ipun>	akurtakov_ okay sounds good
Nov 10 11:53:46 <ipun>	lufimtse ^
Nov 10 11:54:12 <lufimtse>	ok. I'll revert.
Nov 10 11:55:21 <ipun>	lufimtse we'll try to figure something out and see if we can reproduce it 
Nov 10 11:55:34 <lufimtse>	akurtakov_, ipun I reverted it for now...
Nov 10 13:42:29 <rgrunber>	scela: so maybe that entire thing i mentioned is a red herring :\
Nov 10 13:44:27 <rgrunber>	there was something else going on (about the example i chose to debug) that seems to have caused the issue because without that example i can't reproduce it anymore..
Nov 10 13:44:56 <rgrunber>	yet reporters mention doing things unrelated to me so perhaps there's some other way to reproduce the workbench.xmi failure.
Nov 10 15:31:36 <scela>	rgrunber: ok
Nov 11 05:26:05 <scela>	mistria: hey
Nov 11 05:26:15 <mistria>	scela: hi
Nov 11 05:26:15 <scela>	did you upload the example code for our talk somewhere?
Nov 11 05:26:27 <mistria>	scela: nope
Nov 11 05:27:03 <scela>	is there somehow you can upload it on slide share as a link to somewhere (e.g. fedora people)
Nov 11 05:27:24 <scela>	mistria: i'm asking because lars sent me an email asking for the code
Nov 11 05:27:46 <scela>	i can send you the zip
Nov 11 05:29:04 <scela>	i can also upload it somewhere myself but it would be nice for it to be 'near' the slides
Nov 11 05:31:21 <mistria>	scela: can we attach content to slides?
Nov 11 05:31:33 <scela>	mistria: i don't know
Nov 11 05:33:09 <mistria>	scela: ok, please send me the zip, I see if slideshare is going to like it
Nov 11 05:33:32 <scela>	mistria: https://sopotc.fedorapeople.org/editors.zip
Nov 11 05:33:34 <scela>	i put it here
Nov 11 05:33:39 <scela>	you can reference that directly
Nov 11 05:34:36 <mistria>	scela: slideshare doesn't want zip
Nov 11 05:35:04 <mistria>	scela" if you have a slideshare account, it may be better that you comment yourself wth the link, so you'd get notifications is there are some
Nov 11 05:35:30 <scela>	mistria: can you give me the link?
Nov 11 05:35:55 <mistria>	scela: http://www.slideshare.net/mickaelistria/eclipsecon-europe-2016-s-cela-mistria-eclipse-generic-and-extensible-editor-and-language-servers
Nov 11 05:36:52 <scela>	mistria: done
Nov 11 05:37:57 <vkadlcik>	nboldt: hi Nick, thanks for the use case in bugzilla
Nov 11 05:38:17 <vkadlcik>	nboldt: unfortunately it led to a new issue: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4175
Nov 11 06:07:40 <akurtakov_>	mistria: regarding http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.common.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/build.xml
Nov 11 06:07:48 <akurtakov_>	doh https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=506244
Nov 11 06:08:00 <akurtakov_>	ask aph on internal #java
Nov 11 06:08:05 <akurtakov_>	he should know
Nov 11 06:09:42 <akurtakov_>	ask aph on internal #java
Nov 11 06:10:04 *	akurtakov_ goes out writing fails on me now
Nov 11 09:03:07 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: hi Mat, does the missing rhscl-2.3.z flag mean that you can't build bouncycastle?
Nov 11 09:17:02 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Yes, due to check-in policy
Nov 11 09:45:16 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: pity, i thought i would run regression testing through the weekend...
Nov 11 09:51:15 <ipun>	akurtakov_ have you had a chance to check out the DND bug? I am in the office today 
Nov 11 10:03:15 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Hmm. Let me ping kanderso
Nov 11 10:06:53 <vkadlcik>	miracle :-)
Nov 11 10:15:04 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Build is in progress: https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/buildinfo?buildID=523954
Nov 11 10:24:21 <akurtakov_>	ipun: cloned and started eclipse and dndexample - still not working for me
Nov 11 10:24:36 <akurtakov_>	but didn't had time to investigate more
Nov 11 10:29:31 <ipun>	akurtakov_ kk ill work on something else in the time being. It was kind of a "hail mary" fix for you anyways; im not entirely sure what could be so different between your workstation and mine
Nov 11 10:31:03 <akurtakov_>	ipun: me neither
Nov 11 10:31:15 <akurtakov_>	pushing lucene is giving me really hard time 
Nov 11 10:34:38 <ipun>	akurtakov_ take your time, seems like a battle from everyones responses during the meeting this week D:
Nov 11 10:35:34 <akurtakov_>	ipun: it's a war not just a battle :)
Nov 11 10:36:04 <scela>	after many many hurdles, you finish everything, ready to merge, merge. then infra is down so builds hang. so let's ask dennis in canada to help. but it's a holiday in canada. so no builds until monday. there goes your attempt to use the weekend to check on things.
Nov 11 10:36:38 <scela>	that's only the last episode of the show ...
Nov 11 10:37:39 <akurtakov_>	you forgot to mention that killing N-builds pretty much killed the whole week :)
Nov 11 10:39:02 <scela>	oh yeah, we were ready many days ago, but we had the great luck of N-builds getting killed. which also killed the ability of gerrit to pick new orbit stuff. which forces us to do a local aggregator build, which in turn downloads at 5KB/sec because of more infra issues.
Nov 11 10:41:48 <mbooth>	scela: Step away from the keyboard and open yourself a beer :-)
Nov 11 10:43:22 <scela>	mbooth: that's the plan actually :) it's going to be a very welcome weekend
Nov 11 11:01:46 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: thanks, the testing already scheduled

Nov 14 10:24:39 *	Now talking on #eclipse
Nov 14 10:24:39 *	Topic for #eclipse is: Eclipse discussions
Nov 14 10:24:39 *	Topic for #eclipse set by akurtakov!~akurtakov@vpn1-5-170.ams2.redhat.com (Tue May 17 08:53:56 2016)
Nov 14 11:03:56 <rgrunber>	i feel like there's an actual gremlin inside eclipse infra.
Nov 14 11:35:47 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: hey
Nov 14 11:35:51 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: hey
Nov 14 11:36:10 <akurtakov>	is there a reason why lucene bundles don't have about.html?
Nov 14 11:36:33 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: source bundles I mean
Nov 14 11:40:11 <rgrunber>	seems like a bug.. i don't see it added in any sources.
Nov 14 11:40:55 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: about_files with license is also missing
Nov 14 11:41:07 <akurtakov>	would you please fix it ASAP
Nov 14 11:42:10 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: once done, please publish new Orbit N build and let me know of the url by email 
Nov 14 11:42:11 <akurtakov>	:)
Nov 14 11:42:14 <rgrunber>	yeah i'll have it fixed.
Nov 14 11:43:20 <akurtakov>	scela: ^ from debugging the test, looks like it's not recognized due to missing about.html
Nov 14 11:44:12 <scela>	akurtakov: ok
Nov 14 11:44:26 <scela>	that means there is not much needed to do from our side
Nov 14 11:44:34 <scela>	except maybe changing the orbit url
Nov 14 11:44:55 <akurtakov>	yeah
Nov 14 11:45:06 <akurtakov>	scela: btw, what about the build?
Nov 14 11:45:27 <akurtakov>	so you removed .m2, git clean everything
Nov 14 11:45:40 <scela>	it still happened
Nov 14 11:45:47 <scela>	now I re-cloned the aggregator and trying again
Nov 14 11:45:50 <akurtakov>	git clean -fd; git submodule foreach 'git clean -fd"
Nov 14 11:54:08 <mbenitez>	nboldt, hello Nick, re: aeri issue, is that a blocker? I'm just catching up on the thread
Nov 14 11:56:53 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, mbooth I just fwd an email about some lucene issues with devstudio to the team list let's make sure the rpm side of the issue is properly understood by everyone involved
Nov 14 11:59:38 <akurtakov>	I would let mbooth reply as he knows what from where is used
Nov 14 12:02:00 <mbenitez>	makes sense
Nov 14 12:07:31 <scela>	akurtakov: yeah now the build is going which was started from a completely new fresh aggreggator clone
Nov 14 12:07:58 <scela>	akurtakov: after I patched the eclipserun and the forcedQualifierUpdate.txt
Nov 14 12:08:14 <akurtakov>	all indexes 6.x ?
Nov 14 12:08:24 <scela>	it's still going :)
Nov 14 12:18:08 <scela>	nboldt: i didn't follow through all of the thread but here are rules of thumb of lucene versioning
Nov 14 12:18:12 <scela>	4 can read 3
Nov 14 12:18:14 <scela>	3 can not read 4
Nov 14 12:18:24 <scela>	5 can not read 4 by default
Nov 14 12:18:44 <scela>	5 can read 4 if you include lucene-backward-codecs.jar 
Nov 14 12:19:18 <scela>	you can use https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_0_0/core/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexUpgrader.html
Nov 14 12:19:23 <scela>	to bring it from 3 to 4
Nov 14 12:19:33 <scela>	and then use https://lucene.apache.org/core/5_0_0/core/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexUpgrader.html
Nov 14 12:19:38 <scela>	to bring it from 4 to 5
Nov 14 12:20:23 <scela>	i've never tried it but it should be theoretically possible if it's a one-time thing
Nov 14 12:31:07 <scela>	akurtakov: so I peeked into platform.doc.isv and it seems it's 6.1
Nov 14 12:31:12 <scela>	so initial signs are good
Nov 14 12:31:35 <scela>	i'll leave it alone now as I don't want to break stuff while it's going
Nov 14 12:31:47 <scela>	it's tar-ing up the sdks now
Nov 14 13:18:21 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: https://github.com/eclipse/ebr/pull/12 .. once that's in ebr hipp can do a build and i can rebuild orbit-recipes.
Nov 14 13:20:41 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: so we need ebr update first ?
Nov 14 13:20:51 <akurtakov>	can you commit/push there?
Nov 14 13:21:23 <akurtakov>	who canpush there ?
Nov 14 13:22:00 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: likely gunnar is the onlyone.. trying to check repo permissions
Nov 14 13:23:28 <akurtakov>	doh https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/rt.ebr/who
Nov 14 13:23:35 <akurtakov>	another tasktop project
Nov 14 13:28:13 <rgrunber>	k gunnar's on it at least.. i'll make the quick changes and we should be good.
Nov 14 13:29:31 <akurtakov>	ok
Nov 15 10:06:20 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: any of the latest orbit nightlies will be fixed now in source bundles (eg. download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/N-builds/N20161115001400/ )
Nov 15 10:06:42 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: this should be fine ?
Nov 15 10:08:13 <rgrunber>	yes, they're all building off the latest ebr-maven-plugin that packages about files into sources.
Nov 15 10:09:01 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: nice
Nov 15 10:23:50 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: so content changes but qualifier stays the same ??
Nov 15 10:23:56 <akurtakov>	for lucene bundles
Nov 15 10:24:42 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: I'm quite afraid of this ending up in some builders using their cache
Nov 15 10:25:28 <rgrunber>	qualifier is determined by git timestamp.. ugh.. i wonder if a dummy commit touching top-level pom would bump all timestamps..
Nov 15 10:26:14 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: please try and give me orbit build where lucene 6.x has new qualifiers :)
Nov 15 10:30:55 <ipun>	akurtakov I talked with GTK+ team to see what kind of event changes were done in wayland so we dont have to use context_iteration(), but it looks like we might have to redo our DragSource class quite a bit for wayland
Nov 15 10:31:26 <akurtakov>	would this rework make it the same for X11 ?
Nov 15 10:45:19 <ipun>	akurtakov from what I understand of it, yes. The person who worked on it last seem to have opted in 'manually' doing drag and drop, whereas GTK could do it on its own, giving out signals when needed
Nov 15 10:45:35 <ipun>	i'm not entirely sure why the last guy decided to do it this way
Nov 15 10:50:20 <akurtakov>	ipun: go that way :)
Nov 15 10:50:31 <akurtakov>	the last guy probably did it for gtk 1.x :)
Nov 15 10:51:23 *	ipun stretches his fingers
Nov 15 10:51:52 <ipun>	wish me luck :D
Nov 15 10:56:55 <akurtakov>	ipun: g'luck :)
Nov 15 11:28:11 <nboldt>	rgrunber: is https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4085 / https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1392095 fixed ?
Nov 15 11:29:30 <rgrunber>	nboldt: fix is live. discussion was on "does it do anything for rhscl itself".. seems biggest improvement is for jboss devstudio bundles.
Nov 15 11:42:55 <mbenitez>	mbooth, thank you for looking after the eclipse customer issue
Nov 15 11:44:23 <mbooth>	mbenitez: np -- and maybe they will be inclined to upgrade to rh-eclipse46, since it is co-incidentally GA day :-)
Nov 15 11:44:53 <mbenitez>	mbooth, great point, very lucky timing :)
Nov 15 11:48:29 <rgrunber>	mbooth: any idea why that happens ? might spring bundles do something fishy in activator start methods ?
Nov 15 11:50:06 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Unfortunately I've no real idea, I didn't dig through the spring source.
Nov 15 11:50:26 <rgrunber>	mbooth: something something not supported.
Nov 15 11:50:55 <rgrunber>	hopefully clean just works.
Nov 15 11:51:46 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Indeed. After doing -clean, nothing was *obviously* broken, I was able to go through a new-project wizard for example...
Nov 15 11:52:07 <mbooth>	But it's obviously not something we test
Nov 15 11:58:17 <nboldt>	if you're talking about spring IDE bundles (eg., the ones from 3.7.3 we include in Red Hat Central, installable from devstudio) then I believe they have a hard dep on javax.servlet bundle (not package).
Nov 15 11:59:57 <nboldt>	mbooth: ^
Nov 15 12:00:24 <nboldt>	re: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4175
Nov 15 12:00:44 <mbooth>	nboldt: Customer was installing spring ide from http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/update/e4.5/
Nov 15 12:00:56 <mbooth>	(For context)
Nov 15 12:01:53 <nboldt>	ok, so 3.8.2, not 3.7.3
Nov 15 12:02:01 <nboldt>	good to know there's a new release out
Nov 15 12:02:56 <nboldt>	mbooth: could be a problem w/ slf4j.api again
Nov 15 12:03:18 <nboldt>	I see that the spring site includes o.slf4j.api 1.6.4 jar
Nov 15 12:03:33 <rgrunber>	and 1.7.2
Nov 15 12:03:50 <nboldt>	oh, yeah. why two versions?
Nov 15 12:04:19 <mbenitez>	the more the merrier? ;)
Nov 15 12:04:29 <nboldt>	yeah, the more the crashier
Nov 15 12:04:44 <rgrunber>	IU: org.slf4j.impl.log4j12 1.7.2.v20131105-2200
Nov 15 12:04:44 <rgrunber>	-> bundle org.slf4j.api [1.7.2,1.7.3)
Nov 15 12:04:44 <rgrunber>	IU: org.eclipse.jgit.feature.group 4.5.0.201609210915-r
Nov 15 12:04:44 <rgrunber>	-> org.slf4j.api [1.7.2.v20121108-1250]
Nov 15 12:04:47 <rgrunber>	-> org.slf4j.impl.log4j12 [1.7.2.v20131105-2200]
Nov 15 12:04:49 <rgrunber>	IU: org.springframework.ide.eclipse.boot.dash 3.8.2.201610040608-RELEASE
Nov 15 12:04:51 <rgrunber>	-> bundle org.slf4j.api 1.7.2
Nov 15 12:05:05 <mbenitez>	nboldt, definitely
Nov 15 12:05:06 <rgrunber>	and the majority of everything else requires 1.6.2
Nov 15 12:05:23 <rgrunber>	bundle.. so it's require-bundle for 1.6.2
Nov 15 12:15:12 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/N-builds/N20161115170919/ should have lucene 6 timestamps bumped.
Nov 15 12:33:39 <rgrunber>	also tycho desperately needs a tycho-is-the-content-actually-different-ok-then-new-timestamp-plugin
Nov 15 12:46:04 <mbooth>	rgrunber: The jgit-timestamp plugin does that, no? It's just we can't always build from git repo :-(
Nov 15 12:46:40 <rgrunber>	mbooth: in my case i made a change to a maven plugin that changed content packaging.. but the git repo itself had no changes.
Nov 15 12:47:24 <mbooth>	Ah, I see
Nov 15 12:47:25 <rgrunber>	of course it'd have way more overhead so it's just one of those rare cases..
Nov 15 14:06:17 <nboldt>	rgrunber: mbooth: we switched jbosstools builds to use jgit-timestamp-provider (instead of the default) so that plugins/features only get re-versioned when changes actually happen in the git repo
Nov 15 14:07:07 <nboldt>	we're using it in about 98% of all the jbt/devstudio plugins/features (a few use the old default timestamp provider so that every build gets a new/unique timestamp)
Nov 15 14:11:27 <rgrunber>	probably the way to go but it won't catch changes that happen outside of git.. like say a change to tycho-packaging-plugin itself or a change to a property in a parent pom hosted outside of the git repo.
Nov 16 06:48:41 <akurtakov>	mistria: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/85125/ which bug changed the expecte behavior ?
Nov 16 06:50:38 <mistria>	akurtakov: I don't know
Nov 16 06:51:28 <akurtakov>	mistria: do you know someone that can verify this change will not break win/mac ? I'm unsure whether the behavior that Lars described will be the same on all platforms
Nov 16 06:51:54 <mistria>	aakurtakov: in the newer patch set, I've made dfferent conditions according to the OS
Nov 16 06:51:57 <mistria>	akurat
Nov 16 06:52:05 <mistria>	akurtakov: as this test only fails on Linux
Nov 16 06:53:05 <akurtakov>	ah, ok
Nov 16 06:53:17 <akurtakov>	I was still looking at the first one
Nov 16 06:53:47 <akurtakov>	btw, what is TBR ?
Nov 16 06:53:49 <akurtakov>	:)
Nov 16 06:54:42 <mistria>	"to be rendered"
Nov 16 06:54:54 <mistria>	it's a bit like "isVisible" but at the E4 model level
Nov 16 06:59:42 <akurtakov>	ah
Nov 16 08:52:14 <mistria>	scela: hi
Nov 16 08:52:37 <mistria>	scela: how are things with Lucene?
Nov 16 09:04:09 <mistria>	akurtakov: do you think the version of the X server that's used can cause differences in which widget gets focus?
Nov 16 09:04:35 <akurtakov_>	mistria:  could be
Nov 16 09:04:42 <akurtakov_>	but I can't say it for sure
Nov 16 09:05:05 <mistria>	akurtakov_: ok, and do you know which X server is running the Linux test of the official Platform build?
Nov 16 09:05:24 <mistria>	akurtakov_: I have some tests that work locally, work on official build and fail on CI
Nov 16 09:05:42 <akurtakov_>	hmm, official build runs on CI too 
Nov 16 09:26:05 <scela>	mbe
Nov 16 09:26:17 <scela>	mistria: hey
Nov 16 09:26:26 <scela>	mistria: they're good
Nov 16 09:26:29 <scela>	close to done
Nov 16 09:26:34 <mistria>	scela: cool
Nov 16 09:26:40 <scela>	many patches good merged
Nov 16 09:27:19 <scela>	mistria: how is your stuff going?
Nov 16 09:28:40 <mistria>	scela: it's going well, the LSP thing has a very good coverage of the protocol and I don't see any blocker in the generic editor
Nov 16 09:28:59 <mistria>	scela: so it seems like we didn't do it too bad ;)
Nov 16 09:29:12 <scela>	mistria: great to know
Nov 16 09:29:32 <scela>	mistria: i started today to look back at the editor stuff now that lucene is ramping down
Nov 16 09:29:47 <mistria>	scela: there's a topic I've got in my "to investigate" list, and I wanted to know if you're interested in having a look at it, if you have time for it.
Nov 16 09:29:54 <scela>	mistria: resurrecting the .target editor
Nov 16 09:30:05 <mistria>	scela: yes, that would be great actually
Nov 16 09:30:05 <scela>	mistria: what is it?
Nov 16 09:30:23 <mistria>	scela: maybe working on good PDE editors using GEneric Editor is more important than my thing actually...
Nov 16 09:30:33 <mistria>	scela: it's Asynchronous code completion
Nov 16 09:30:45 <mistria>	scela: in generic editor first, then to move upstream
Nov 16 09:30:50 <scela>	mistria: did the SAP guy get back to us?
Nov 16 09:31:21 <mistria>	scela: he posted his design notes on the mailing-list, he cannot move the code for technical reason (too much coupling with their internals)
Nov 16 09:31:56 <mistria>	scela: and his design notes are good and seem relatively affordable to implement
Nov 16 09:32:19 <mistria>	scela: but really, ATM, I think using generic editor in PDE is more important
Nov 16 09:32:28 <scela>	i also think so
Nov 16 09:32:29 <mistria>	scela: as it sets up example for other projects
Nov 16 09:32:46 <scela>	i have target platform and manifest editor planned
Nov 16 09:33:01 <scela>	and i think this stuff is higher prio than the async completion
Nov 16 09:33:08 <mistria>	scela: the MANIFEST editor isn't that bad, so it's lower priority
Nov 16 09:33:25 <mistria>	scela: a textual editor for .target would really make a lot of people happy
Nov 16 09:33:37 <scela>	mistria: yeah I know people keep telling me that
Nov 16 09:33:47 <mistria>	scela: replacing the biggest piece of crap of the Eclipse PDE experience by something helpful!
Nov 16 09:35:09 <scela>	mistria: depending on how much time akurtakov_ wants me to spend on helping 'non-aggregator' projects move to lucene I might be able to work on it soon
Nov 16 09:35:28 <mistria>	scela: ok, no pb
Nov 16 09:35:58 <mistria>	scela: I just wanted to mention this async code complete, but I forgot you already have a good todo-list regarding generic editors
Nov 16 09:37:19 <scela>	mistria: oh yeah it's good and big
Nov 16 09:37:34 <scela>	list
Nov 16 09:37:59 <mistria>	:)
Nov 16 10:21:09 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I can see why people try not to do z-stream updates -- even more bureaucracy...
Nov 16 10:21:21 <mbenitez>	:)
Nov 16 10:21:57 <mbenitez>	mbooth, there's some true to that... and RHSCL zstreams are not as complex as those for RHEL
Nov 16 10:22:27 <mbenitez>	the zstream flag should come shortly, we're in the SCL call now so Kerri is taking notes
Nov 16 10:22:51 <mbooth>	Aha, great :-)
Nov 16 10:23:35 <mbenitez>	and all seems on track for the other bug [rh-java-common]
Nov 16 10:23:37 <akurtakov_>	scela: regarding lucene - we will need mylyn, dltk, aeri to be contacted and asked to do the update
Nov 16 10:23:45 <rgrunber>	mbooth: who would have though the phrase 'due to legal concerns' would be a legal conern.
Nov 16 10:23:48 <akurtakov_>	which doesn't mean they will do it 
Nov 16 10:24:15 <akurtakov_>	scela: so if they say we stay at the old version - nothing we can do :)
Nov 16 10:24:25 <akurtakov_>	and you can move on 
Nov 16 10:24:30 <akurtakov_>	to target editor?
Nov 16 10:24:31 <mbooth>	rgrunber: It's pretty obvious, but IANAL :-)
Nov 16 10:26:38 <scela>	akurtakov_: ok
Nov 16 10:27:00 <scela>	akurtakov_: tomorrow i'll test the i-build (if there is one) and if that goes well i'll send out an email
Nov 16 10:27:52 <akurtakov_>	scela: I hope we will get past this phase soon
Nov 16 10:27:55 <scela>	mbenitez: are you sending the report email?
Nov 16 10:28:07 <scela>	akurtakov_: lack of i-build you mean?
Nov 16 10:28:17 <mbenitez>	scela, I did already but it didn't arrive :(
Nov 16 10:28:21 <akurtakov_>	and lucene churn :)
Nov 16 10:28:33 <mbenitez>	there must be an email backlog [for mailing lists]
Nov 16 10:28:37 <akurtakov_>	mbenitez: fwiw, my emails are delayed too
Nov 16 10:28:55 <akurtakov_>	someone wants to punish the few of us still on zimbra :)
Nov 16 10:28:56 <mbenitez>	akurtakov_, thanks for confirming
Nov 16 10:29:02 <mbenitez>	haha
Nov 16 10:29:22 <mbenitez>	I was also going to say it might be gmail :P
Nov 16 10:30:30 *	scela starts writing it in gedit 
Nov 16 10:30:53 <mistria>	akurtakov_: any chance one day, the Eclipse Foundation stops using SLES and use fully CentOS?
Nov 16 10:30:56 <akurtakov_>	scela: haha, that's my choice of mail editor too :)
Nov 16 10:31:12 <akurtakov_>	mistria: we have given them even RHEL subscriptions 
Nov 16 10:31:32 <akurtakov_>	if they want to run the original
Nov 16 10:31:49 <mbooth>	scela: What, Eclipse generic editor can't edit email? :-o
Nov 16 10:34:38 <scela>	mbooth: i need to take some time off eclipse editors or I'll get addicted
Nov 16 10:35:03 <scela>	akurtakov_: :)
Nov 16 10:39:14 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: d'oh.. just saw your post.. i was like.. i'm gonna be the first person to post..
Nov 16 10:39:26 <rgrunber>	mine hasn't arrived either :(
Nov 16 10:39:45 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, still gold star for the effort :)
Nov 16 10:40:12 <scela>	akurtakov_: m-build failed again
Nov 16 10:44:33 <mistria>	mbooth: Lotus Notes has Eclipse plugins to write and send emails
Nov 16 10:45:05 <scela>	mbenitez: funny as memo-list never has backlog issues. it would be nice if they have a yearly pause due to backlogs there.
Nov 16 10:45:37 <mbenitez>	haha maybe also helpful to catch up with it
Nov 16 10:45:45 <mistria>	scela mbenitez: maybe the posts on our mailing-list now go through manual moderation. Did someone post something inappropriate :D ?
Nov 16 10:46:22 <rgrunber>	mistria: an election thread started yesterday..
Nov 16 10:46:25 <mbenitez>	mistria, you're blowing up somebody's censorship cover ;)
Nov 16 10:46:51 <scela>	mbenitez: no thanks. my only interaction with it is the daily 'mark all as read'
Nov 16 10:46:56 <akurtakov_>	scela: the price of un-wizarding builds
Nov 16 10:47:14 <mbenitez>	FYI from outage list: All Zimbra Hosts Scheduled Maintenance | 2016-11-17 - 1800 EDT
Nov 16 10:47:43 <akurtakov_>	mbenitez: I knew it's punishment for zimbra users only
Nov 16 10:47:44 <mbenitez>	but that shouldn't be it :\
Nov 16 10:48:03 <mbenitez>	akurtakov_, you won the bet
Nov 16 10:48:09 <scela>	akurtakov_: it just strengthens our resolve
Nov 16 10:48:27 <rgrunber>	heh.. so anyone posting now will be labeled a gmail collaborator.
Nov 16 10:48:45 <scela>	agitators!
Nov 16 10:49:04 <mbenitez>	I was about to ask mbooth if he got email but now it's too dangerous
Nov 16 10:49:14 *	mbooth whistles innocently
Nov 16 10:49:21 <mbenitez>	:)
Nov 16 10:51:34 <akurtakov_>	fwiw, I blame the last few years "network is the computer" 2 series 
Nov 16 10:54:01 <mistria>	akurtakov_: I'm using Thunderbird and I'm punished too
Nov 16 10:54:30 <akurtakov_>	mistria: I stopped ~2 years ago when zimbra broke with kmail
Nov 16 10:55:05 <scela>	mistria: i tried thunderbird once
Nov 16 10:55:12 <scela>	mistria: i hated it
Nov 16 10:55:37 <mistria>	scela: I also hate it, but I guess that's just because it's the app I use the most and I don't develop...
Nov 16 10:56:17 <mistria>	scela: but it does what I expect, and it's not better than GMail or Zimbra for me
Nov 16 10:56:27 <mistria>	scela: and offline emails is actually often useful
Nov 16 11:15:30 *	Disconnected (Connection timed out)

Nov 16 13:57:19 *	Topic for #eclipse is: Eclipse discussions
Nov 16 13:57:19 *	Topic for #eclipse set by akurtakov!~akurtakov@vpn1-5-170.ams2.redhat.com (Tue May 17 08:53:56 2016)
Nov 16 14:00:12 <rgrunber>	why they decided to merge two different bundles into one and pretend they're one thing .. ugh..
Nov 16 14:02:22 <nboldt>	well, as Orbit King, you can fix this, right? No need to get it approved by the senate or the house... just write up the bill and make it a law :D
Nov 16 14:03:43 <rgrunber>	nboldt: it's tougher... that bundle is old, it'll remain.. i've improved the situation going forward... httpclient 4.5.2 has none of httpclient-cache and if anyone cares enough about it.. contribution is always welcome :P
Nov 16 14:04:37 <rgrunber>	maybe i could remove it from future repositories.. but even then it comes down to how likely plugins consuming it are to adopt new one..
Nov 16 14:07:36 <rgrunber>	nboldt: so are we good with the httpclient issue ? i mean solution is just to make sure the system contains the same content as Orbit's httpclient 4.3.6.
Nov 16 14:07:59 <rgrunber>	.. and we don't even have to resort to crazy modifications of p2.
Nov 16 14:12:22 <nboldt>	well, I can try the symlink thing and see if it works
Nov 16 14:18:03 <rgrunber>	you'd have to add the symlink and an entry in the .info file.
Nov 16 14:18:17 <rgrunber>	but that really should be the problem.. makes perfect sense :P
Nov 16 14:29:47 <nboldt>	rgrunber: info file?
Nov 16 14:29:57 <rgrunber>	fragment.info
Nov 16 14:30:24 <nboldt>	so I need to patch that ?
Nov 16 14:30:43 <nboldt>	I don't have a fragment.info in the devstudio spec build right now
Nov 16 14:31:10 <rgrunber>	yes, so equinox picks it up. /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/eclipse/droplets/devstudio/eclipse/fragment.info
Nov 16 14:31:22 <nboldt>	do you have an example of this file?
Nov 16 14:31:58 <rgrunber>	one sec..
Nov 16 14:32:12 <rgrunber>	it's basically like the bundle.info file in configuration/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator
Nov 16 14:32:14 <nboldt>	./rh-eclipse46/root/usr/share/eclipse/droplets/devstudio/eclipse/fragment.info exists but how do I create that?
Nov 16 14:32:27 <nboldt>	(under /opt/rh)
Nov 16 14:32:37 <rgrunber>	hmm
Nov 16 14:33:34 <rgrunber>	we're entering into unknown territory.. ie.. i don't think this has been attempted.. but you could basically append to the file in %install, after %mvn_install runs.. which i assume ran to generate that file ?
Nov 16 14:34:35 <nboldt>	no idea, this is all unknown turf for me too
Nov 16 14:34:40 <rgrunber>	format is BSN,VERSION,relative/path/to/jar,4,false
Nov 16 14:34:49 <nboldt>	but at least I can add the rpm dep and the symlink a la http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/rpms/eclipse/tree/eclipse.spec?h=rhscl-2.3-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7#n828
Nov 16 14:35:50 <rgrunber>	ah nvm, you call repo2runnable..
Nov 16 14:36:17 <rgrunber>	nboldt: so somewhere under that https://github.com/rgrunber/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/devstudio.spec#L74
Nov 17 11:47:52 <nboldt>	hey, rgrunber what's the process for getting rh-java-common-jetty-rewrite bumped up to 9.3.9?
Nov 17 11:48:00 <nboldt>	(currently at 9.0.3)
Nov 17 11:48:25 <nboldt>	finding more 3rd party things that devstudio tries to install to ~/.eclipse (but don't already exist in /opt/rh/ 
Nov 17 11:49:09 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i'd file a bug in rhscl under rh-java-common.. i doesn't seem likely to happen though so late in the cycle.. and risk might be higher than just altering some metadata.
Nov 17 11:49:31 <nboldt>	yeah, just curious. might be a fix for future
Nov 17 11:49:32 <nboldt>	thx
Nov 17 11:50:02 <nboldt>	meanwhile, looks like the "add symlinks and entries in fragment.info" solution IS WORKING :DD
Nov 17 11:50:10 <nboldt>	just fine-tuning it a bit now
Nov 17 11:50:23 <rgrunber>	nboldt: whoo \o/ good. just a question though.
Nov 17 11:50:56 <rgrunber>	ah nvm i think i see your point
Nov 17 11:51:27 <rgrunber>	so jetty-rewrite is already on the system and symlinked into a droplet but p2 tries to install it anyways from update site because 9.0.3 isn't good enough ?...
Nov 17 11:51:43 <nboldt>	not quite
Nov 17 11:51:56 <nboldt>	it's NOT in a droplet (unless I add it as an rpm dep)
Nov 17 11:52:10 <rgrunber>	so then what's the issue with p2 just getting it remotely ?
Nov 17 11:52:22 <rgrunber>	as long as the remote content pulled doesn't clash it should be ok.
Nov 17 11:52:35 <rgrunber>	httpclient was a very special case of remote and local content clashing.
Nov 17 11:52:38 <nboldt>	but if I *DO* add it as an rpm dep (and then also a symlink + fragment.info entry) the one I'd add is for 9.0.3, not the one that devstudio needs (9.3.9)
Nov 17 11:56:01 <nboldt>	tldr prolly don't need to bother with those (but I am adding symlinks for commons.lang, xml.resolver, and xml.serializer because wth, might as well
Nov 17 11:56:46 <rgrunber>	nboldt: true.. so a nice-to-have for sure.
Nov 17 11:57:26 <rgrunber>	still.. it's a bit hacky.. you're manuall adding an unnecessary dep into devstudio for something that may or may not be installed through p2.
Nov 17 11:57:42 <rgrunber>	*unnecessary initially
Nov 17 11:57:47 <nboldt>	I'm preventing problems when things are installed from central or from the devstudio update site
Nov 17 11:58:14 <nboldt>	can't fix the "another singleton selected" warnings but I can avoid extra stuff showing up in ~/.eclipse/
Nov 17 11:58:54 <nboldt>	only way to avoid them singleton errors is to update from rpm (root user, /opt/rh/) instead of user (~/.eclipse)
Nov 17 11:59:03 <rgrunber>	but jetty* shouldn't be singleton at all.
Nov 17 11:59:07 <nboldt>	or to make the /opt/rh folders writeable by the user ?
Nov 17 11:59:10 <nboldt>	true, it's not
Nov 17 11:59:34 <nboldt>	I just know that we've had problems in the past w/ different versions of jetty bundles in the target platform
Nov 17 11:59:40 <nboldt>	so I'd prefer to avoid that :D
Nov 17 12:00:22 <rgrunber>	k fair enough. it just seemed to me like you were opening the door to "let's install all the bundles onto the system"
Nov 17 12:42:49 <nboldt>	hey, we have a different version of the usage plugin in devstudio vs. in /usr/share/eclipse/droplets/usage/eclipse/plugins/ ... mbooth ... is that intentional?
Nov 17 12:43:08 <nboldt>	one in eclipse is 2.2.1, and the devstudio one is 2.2.2
Nov 17 12:43:26 <nboldt>	which means you can update from the shared one to the devstudio-specific one ... 
Nov 17 12:43:38 <nboldt>	but it looks like the sources are the same even if the versions differ
Nov 17 12:43:57 <nboldt>	I guess my ultimate question is.. should the usage plugin in rh-eclipse46-base be 2.2.2 too?
Nov 17 12:44:07 <nboldt>	be versioned 2.2.2, that is
Nov 17 13:03:39 <mbenitez>	nboldt, Mat will have to confirm, but I remember a conversation about a patched 2.2.1 in Fedora/scl vs 2.2.2 probably we'll have to rebuild and ship the same version rpm with the zstream
Nov 17 13:08:29 <nboldt>	not sure it matters (other than cosmetically)... assuming the sources are the same in both places
Nov 17 13:08:33 <nboldt>	mbenitez: ^
Nov 17 13:08:56 <nboldt>	if sources differ then we need to make 'em the same or make the rpm version versioned higher than the other one
Nov 17 13:09:38 <nboldt>	otherwise Help > install new > update devstudio will remove the rpm-installed one in favour of the installer/update site version, which will remove any rpm-specific tracking
Nov 17 13:10:01 <nboldt>	(I can't recall if the changes were done in jbosstools-base too.)
Nov 17 13:12:02 <nboldt>	ok, false alarm. looks like what we need is in the 2.2.2 version here https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-base/commit/3210c20d0ba400a2be2561e3f8c4899ae7ddbf19
Nov 17 13:12:30 <nboldt>	and thus either version of the plugin will do the same thing, as long as /opt/rh/rh-eclipse46/root/usr/lib64/eclipse/.pkgs/Devstudio exists
Nov 17 13:16:07 <mbenitez>	ok
Nov 17 13:56:01 <nboldt>	hey, @all... just found a bash script for doing the equivalent of an agile standup based on your previous commits
Nov 17 13:56:04 <nboldt>	https://github.com/kamranahmedse/git-standup
Nov 17 13:56:51 <nboldt>	eg., cd ~/where/you/have/github/projects/checked/out; git-standup -m 2 -d 7 # what did I do this week?
Nov 17 14:17:14 <ipun>	akurtakov_ good news, i am getting closer with my dnd fix. So far, it only looks like 'label' widgets is having trouble communicating to GTK
Nov 17 15:24:39 <rgrunber>	nboldt: nice :) i use occasionally https://github.com/psss/did to remind myself.. it checks git, bugzilla, gerrit and github.. still a bit buggy though.
Nov 17 15:26:44 <nboldt>	rgrunber: love that there's a py version of a bash script and that we (ad a dev community) keep reinventing solution to the same needs
Nov 17 15:26:51 <nboldt>	s/ad/as
Nov 17 15:30:24 <rgrunber>	yeah, they went with python to make it a little easier to do all the plugins.
Nov 17 15:30:45 <rgrunber>	it even has trello support now
Nov 17 17:24:54 <nboldt>	another reason to dislike lucene 5: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4188
Nov 18 09:48:07 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: no issue with tycho 0.26 for platform right?
Nov 18 09:48:30 <mbooth>	akurtakov_: No issues that I know of
Nov 18 09:48:39 <akurtakov_>	good pushing :)
Nov 18 09:49:37 <akurtakov_>	scela: I don't think Marc-Andre understands you correct
Nov 18 09:49:47 <akurtakov_>	from his last mail I think it's the opposite
Nov 18 09:50:09 <akurtakov_>	aka if they open index build with oxygen with neon they will see exception?
Nov 18 11:06:29 *	scox is away: food bank
Nov 18 11:12:37 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: just curious, is it possible for a user to define a null connection name ?
Nov 18 11:12:54 <rgrunber>	iirc connection name is a required parameter.
Nov 18 11:14:05 *	rgrunber shakes his fist at mbooth .
Nov 18 11:14:19 <rgrunber>	i would have completed mine yesterday if the token authentication didn't magically go down.
Nov 18 11:14:27 <rgrunber>	1 more module :(
Nov 18 11:14:39 <mbooth>	rgrunber: What I do‽
Nov 18 11:14:58 <mbooth>	Oh, I get it
Nov 18 11:15:02 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, close enough :) thank you too
Nov 18 11:15:08 *	mbooth is fully compliant
Nov 18 11:15:19 <rgrunber>	you mean enterprise ready
Nov 18 11:15:24 <mbooth>	Web-scale
Nov 18 11:15:45 <rgrunber>	compliant with corporate standards-at-scale
Nov 18 11:16:09 *	mbooth looks around for some synergy to leverage
Nov 18 11:18:06 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: no, the connection name should not be null. IIRC, the wizard prevents empty/null name. Otherwise, it's a bug
Nov 18 11:20:52 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: so then any ideas which kind of connection it was ?
Nov 18 11:21:19 <rgrunber>	ie.. docker-machine, unix, ..
Nov 18 11:21:46 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: are you talking about the issue I just created ? It seems like it's a race conditions at startup: connection.getImages() returns null if the launch config is opened too fast.
Nov 18 11:22:02 <xcoulon>	I'm working on it, but I have to get my daughter at school right now
Nov 18 11:22:10 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: ah no i mean connection.getName.. the one i just +2 now
Nov 18 11:48:42 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: ha sorry, I was lacking the context of your question
Nov 18 11:51:20 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: so we need to merge the patch on the 'stable-5.2' branch, too, correct ?
Nov 18 11:52:02 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: yes you could just cherry-pick onto it.
Nov 18 11:52:09 <xcoulon>	ok
Nov 18 11:58:01 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: so it's building now on stable-5.2: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/85312/
Nov 18 12:15:11 *	scox is back (gone 01:08:42)
Nov 18 12:42:04 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I switched the linuxtools-neon build to use stable-5.2 so you can go ahead with master changes
Nov 18 13:29:40 <rgrunber>	mbooth: did rh-java-common-lucene-4.8.0-6.8 every exist ?
Nov 18 13:29:49 <rgrunber>	ever*
Nov 18 13:30:53 <mbooth>	rgrunber: If it's not built for reals yet, there is scratch build here... https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/koji/taskinfo?taskID=12113416
Nov 18 13:31:19 <rgrunber>	ah.. k just what i needed.
Nov 18 13:31:21 <mbooth>	Looks like still waiting for a qa_ack :-(
Nov 18 13:31:29 <rgrunber>	oh crap.. that's a lot of lucenes
Nov 18 13:31:47 <mbooth>	Ah, you only need lucene and lucene-analysis, iirc
Nov 18 13:32:59 <mbooth>	Or you know, don't upgrade epp-logging yet :-)
Nov 18 13:33:20 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I can un-tag it if it's inconvenient
Nov 18 13:33:30 <rgrunber>	yeah seems only the 2..
Nov 18 13:33:34 <rgrunber>	it's fine.. installing.
Nov 18 13:34:05 <rgrunber>	i just figured i'd need like 5 or 6 given what's in Orbit.
Nov 18 13:38:08 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Yeah, lucene 4 wasn't bad. Although at current rate lucene have a class to bundle ratio of 1:1 in ~ 10 more major versions....
Nov 18 13:38:32 <mbooth>	Which at current rate of release will be ~ 3 weeks
Nov 18 13:41:11 <rgrunber>	they're taking a first class approach to classes.
Nov 21 04:58:42 <akurtakov>	mistria: morning :0
Nov 21 04:58:47 <akurtakov>	are you signing for https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=507861 work ?
Nov 21 04:59:17 <mistria>	akurtakov: I'd rather get someone else doing it ;)
Nov 21 04:59:41 <mistria>	akurtakov: I'd like to negociate it with Lars, Simon, Olivier or other Eclipse "trainer"
Nov 21 04:59:51 <akurtakov>	cool
Nov 21 05:00:23 <akurtakov>	I like it a lot but want to also be sure it will be acted upon as many had it in their mind for quite some time without much happening :)
Nov 21 05:07:23 <mistria>	akurtakov: that said, if you think it's worth it, I can put it in my backlog
Nov 21 05:07:49 <mistria>	akurtakov: most of the issues I'm working on right now are pendring for a review
Nov 21 05:08:49 <akurtakov>	mistria: please do put on your plan to advertise it heavily hoping for others to pick up
Nov 21 05:09:01 <akurtakov>	and maybe creating the automated test to do it
Nov 21 06:40:57 <mbooth>	Aha, switching VPN endpoints away from ams2 works...
Nov 21 07:33:19 <scela>	mistria: hey
Nov 21 07:33:35 <scela>	what exactly was 'erroneous' about the <eclipserun-repo> ?
Nov 21 07:34:08 <akurtakov>	scela: I-builds are cleaned regularly 
Nov 21 07:34:14 <akurtakov>	except for the 2000 builds
Nov 21 07:34:31 <akurtakov>	thus the I-build I pointed to was deleted by the cleanup tasks
Nov 21 07:35:05 <scela>	akurtakov: i thought I-builds stay for more than one week
Nov 21 07:35:12 <scela>	the Nbuilds were cleared up
Nov 21 07:35:20 <akurtakov>	there are no more N-builds
Nov 21 07:35:37 <scela>	akurtakov: i know but now the I-builds get the clean up rate of I-builds?
Nov 21 07:35:43 <akurtakov>	thus new Ibuild retention policy is in development 
Nov 21 07:35:57 <scela>	s/last I-build/N-build
Nov 21 07:36:05 <akurtakov>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=507271
Nov 21 07:36:11 <scela>	how is it right now?
Nov 21 07:36:29 <akurtakov>	keep all tue I-builds for Milestone
Nov 21 07:36:38 <akurtakov>	keep all 2000 I-builds for a week
Nov 21 07:37:22 <akurtakov>	generally no one cares about that and it's still being tweaked 
Nov 21 07:38:30 <akurtakov>	only time it matters is when a incompatible change happens in I-build requiring the eclipserunrepo to point ot it
Nov 21 09:37:43 <mistria>	scela: hey

Nov 21 13:59:18 *	Topic for #eclipse set by akurtakov!~akurtakov@vpn1-5-170.ams2.redhat.com (Tue May 17 08:53:56 2016)
Nov 21 14:01:26 <akazakov>	mistria, it seems to be safe to check if the application name contains "|Devstudio"
Nov 21 14:03:08 <akazakov>	ah, you already created a PR. Didn't see it.
Nov 21 14:03:13 <mistria>	akazakov: ok, and what about JBoss Tools?
Nov 21 14:03:25 <mistria>	akazakov: or there are no RPM of JBT for 4.4.2?
Nov 21 14:11:18 <akazakov>	mistria, no RPM for JBT. Only devstudio
Nov 21 14:11:38 <akazakov>	but checking "|" only should be OK too
Nov 22 10:00:55 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: here?
Nov 22 10:01:03 <mbooth>	Yep
Nov 22 10:01:41 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: can one build the scl srpms easily as plain rpms (aka without scl)?
Nov 22 10:02:15 <mbooth>	In theory, yes -- all scl macros should be conditional
Nov 22 10:02:38 <rgrunber>	imo the entire buil process (bootstrap/etc) is pretty complicated and that user wants to simply build one (the eclipse srpm).
Nov 22 10:03:36 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: what is the condition?
Nov 22 10:04:18 <mbooth>	akazakov: On whether the meta-build package is installed (in our case, rh-eclipse46-build)
Nov 22 10:04:29 <mbooth>	akurtakov_: ^
Nov 22 10:04:47 <akurtakov_>	mbooth: thanks
Nov 22 10:04:53 <mbooth>	This supplies the magic that activates the build macros
Nov 22 10:46:47 <nboldt>	mbooth: rgrunber: if we wanted to have the devstudio RPM signed (and use gpgcheck=1 in .repo) what's the process around that? something doable or ... is it impossible unless we build in brew?
Nov 22 10:47:32 <mbenitez>	nboldt, IIRC it is doable, siege may be able to confirm
Nov 22 10:47:47 <mbenitez>	I barely remember from my EAP days :\
Nov 22 10:53:57 <nboldt>	lvalach: just before you joined, I asked... "if we wanted to have the devstudio RPM signed (and use gpgcheck=1 in .repo) what's the process around that? something doable or ... is it impossible unless we build in brew?" and the response was: "IIRC it is doable, siege may be able to confirm"
Nov 22 10:55:02 <nboldt>	so if you want to email cobrien@redhat (siege on IRC, Chris O'Brien elsewhere) and cc: me, you can ask what's needed to sign an rpm which is built from not-all-sources and built not in brew/mead. 
Nov 22 10:55:54 <nboldt>	lvalach: you could link him to the build script, https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/build.sh so he knows what magic we're doing and if there's a way to run that somewhere where we can sign it too
Nov 22 10:59:28 <lvalach>	Ok, thank you very much Nick. 
Nov 22 10:59:57 <mbenitez>	lvalach, you may CC me too in case there's need for more explanations
Nov 22 11:00:34 <lvalach>	Ok, thank you.
Nov 22 11:01:14 <rgrunber>	https://engineering.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Policy/30.se/html/Security_Engineering/chap-Security_Engineering-Package_Signing_Server.html seems to indicate anyone with kerberos should be able to do it now.
Nov 22 11:03:29 <nboldt>	rgrunber: so (didn't read link) it's just a manual process rather than something we can do as part of the CI build ?
Nov 22 11:04:47 <nboldt>	hmm. so similar process to signing the devsuite installer, I guess. https://engineering.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Policy/30.se/html/Security_Engineering/sect-Security_Engineering-Package_Signing_Server-Using_the_rpm_sign_client_to_sign_RPMs.html not a fan of manual process steps, though
Nov 22 11:05:34 <rgrunber>	assuming that process applies, it might be possible to automate.. ie user of machine must have kerberos ticket and then just a matter of uploading to a machine that has rpm-sign and calling that over ssh or whatnot..
Nov 22 11:06:03 <nboldt>	rgrunber: sure but are there generic kerberos tickets in any of the Jenkinses?
Nov 22 11:06:17 <nboldt>	and don't tickets expire after 10 hrs?
Nov 22 12:03:47 <nboldt>	mistria: I see what you did there: https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms/commit/26e5e693ec3ec59e8e508856b241038f7dce4f26
Nov 22 12:04:29 <nboldt>	so the reason this doesn't fail for me locally is that the bundles I need are already in my ~/.m2/repo cache, but in Jenkins, they're missing and so the p2diff step fails?
Nov 22 12:05:07 <mistria>	nboldt: I'm not sure, I don't even know whether the suggested patch fixes the issue
Nov 22 12:05:34 <mistria>	nboldt: I just looked on CI and found config.ini seemed to miss the org.eclipse.core.net bundle
Nov 22 12:07:44 <nboldt>	ah, wondered how you figured that out. I was comparing versions of org.eclipse.equinox.launcher but didn't seem to solve things
Nov 22 12:08:01 <nboldt>	mistria: your PR is building in the PR builder... which might actually work this time :D
Nov 22 12:10:25 <mistria>	@all: is it worth going to Fedora 25 right now? Are there annoyance for regular Eclipse dev?
Nov 22 12:16:25 <nboldt>	rgrunber: have you moved to Fedora 25 yet? ^
Nov 22 12:16:55 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i haven't but probably will when i get some time to upgrade.
Nov 22 12:17:48 <nboldt>	anyone you know already on Rawhide? rgrunber ? asking for mistria ^
Nov 22 12:18:47 <mistria>	maybe ipun or lufimtse 
Nov 22 12:19:06 <mbenitez>	mistria, you beat me, I think the swt guys are on F25 :)
Nov 22 12:19:11 <ipun>	yeah we both are 
Nov 22 12:19:43 <mistria>	ipun: so worth the upgrade, no Eclipse issue?
Nov 22 12:20:10 <ipun>	mistria ... if you run it in x.org there wont be :)
Nov 22 12:21:11 <ipun>	what you could do is run F25 in default wayland, but run the eclipse process in x11 which seems to work okay 
Nov 22 12:21:25 <mistria>	ipun:ok
Nov 22 12:21:43 <mistria>	ipun: do you have some public doc or blog about how to do it?
Nov 22 12:22:07 <ipun>	mistria no but I've been meaning to, worth to start a blog?
Nov 22 12:22:15 <mistria>	ipun: I think we'll need an "officialish" document for it asap
Nov 22 12:22:40 <mistria>	ipun: I believe it's worth a blog post, @mbenitez: WDYT?
Nov 22 12:23:25 <lufimtse>	nboldt, I'm on F25
Nov 22 12:24:23 <lufimtse>	nboldt, I wrote a blog article on how to run Eclipse on Wayland
Nov 22 12:24:24 <lufimtse>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface#See_also
Nov 22 12:24:38 <lufimtse>	with that said, the eclipse from repository by default switches to X11
Nov 22 12:24:53 <lufimtse>	but you need the above for eclipse's that you download from the site.
Nov 22 12:24:55 <mbenitez>	mistria, you know me well by now, ipun you've been tagged :)
Nov 22 12:25:07 <lufimtse>	sec
Nov 22 12:25:10 <lufimtse>	link is wrong
Nov 22 12:25:16 <lufimtse>	https://coffeeorientedprogramming.com/2016/10/06/make-applications-eclipse-use-x11-backend-on-wayland-fedora-25/ 
Nov 22 12:25:24 <lufimtse>	nboldt, ^ correct link.
Nov 22 12:25:47 <ipun>	ah yes that was the discovery i made when testing eclipse on wayland, im pretty sure i told lufimtse to write it
Nov 22 12:25:54 <nboldt>	lufimtse: how does F25 work with RHSCL / RHEL 7.2 repos? do they fight or play nice?
Nov 22 12:26:32 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I assume you will be resubmitting your 3.6.8 patch after -2ing it...you can self-approve
Nov 22 12:26:46 <nboldt>	tldr, mistria if you move to F25, use export GDK_BACKEND=x11 when running eclipse
Nov 22 12:26:58 <mbenitez>	nboldt, that's a gamble, mix & match may work but... you never know
Nov 22 12:27:23 <lufimtse>	nboldt, I haven't used RHSCL on my Fedora, so I can't say. I use fedora repos and RPM fusion
Nov 22 12:27:34 <nboldt>	well, mix'n'match works OK in F24, but I'm building a couple vms for cleaner testing
Nov 22 12:27:36 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: k sounds fine.. just -2 until i confirm it all works as i expected.
Nov 22 12:27:52 <lufimtse>	nboldt, so far, everything works well on Fedora 25. I event got my webcam working on my mac.
Nov 22 12:28:15 <lufimtse>	The only trouble I observe is that once in a while my caret goes missing in gmail. (in both Chrome and Firefox).
Nov 22 12:28:25 <lufimtse>	But opening a new page fixes it.
Nov 22 12:28:32 <nboldt>	started Centos7 image on the weekend; will try RHEL 7.2 when not swamped with releng duties (code freeze coming up tomorrow & thurs for devstudio)
Nov 22 12:29:16 <nboldt>	ah, well I run F24 in a VM because fighting with hardware is for the young :P I don't have time to screw w/ hardware issues anymore
Nov 22 12:29:34 <nboldt>	meanwhile, everything Just Works in W10 :)
Nov 22 12:29:46 <ipun>	mistria wheres this offical "blog" site we should write on?
Nov 22 12:31:34 <mbenitez>	ipun, usually we'd say http://developerblog.redhat.com/  *but* since this issue right now is Fedora only having a blog for the fedora community would be the key
Nov 22 12:46:08 <ipun>	mbenitez true. Do you still want me to do a small entry for them?
Nov 22 12:48:54 <mbenitez>	ipun, it would be good, just to make it really clear that wayland is WIP, you could even encourage people to try it and report bugs or help
Nov 22 14:11:04 <ipun>	mbenitez okay sure. ill look into it
Nov 22 14:12:37 <ipun>	...after eclipe demo camps :D
Nov 22 14:14:05 <mbenitez>	sure
Nov 22 14:47:46 <nboldt>	hey, when uninstalling features in ~/.eclipse ... the features are deleted but the plugins remain. is that expected?
Nov 22 14:47:53 <nboldt>	rgrunber:  ^
Nov 22 14:48:48 <rgrunber>	nboldt: don't know about features being deleted by plugins remaining seems right.. i've seen it even in regular upstream eclipse.
Nov 22 14:48:52 <rgrunber>	but*
Nov 22 14:49:25 <nboldt>	seems like a compromise between proper cleanup and optimized reinstallation
Nov 22 14:49:41 <nboldt>	proper cleanup: delete the feature, delete its contained plugins too
Nov 22 14:49:53 <rgrunber>	they're simply removed from bundles.info so they don't start.
Nov 22 14:49:59 <nboldt>	optimized reinstall: oh, look, the plugins are already downloaded
Nov 22 14:50:14 <nboldt>	yeah, that seems... sloppy?
Nov 22 14:50:42 <rgrunber>	imo i would have always liked for the plugin to be gone.
Nov 22 14:50:53 <nboldt>	if I uninstall the integration stack, I should get back 113M, not 1M
Nov 22 14:51:24 <nboldt>	rgrunber: rhscl bug/enhancement for next cycle? 
Nov 22 14:51:36 <rgrunber>	nboldt: it should really be an upstream p2 bug :P
Nov 22 14:51:57 <nboldt>	oh, so this happens in plain eclipse from tar.gz unpack install?
Nov 22 14:52:11 <nboldt>	hmm, need to verify that
Nov 22 14:55:38 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i guess it'd make sense so that one could always revert.. from Installation History..
Nov 22 14:58:57 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i can reproduce on upstream Eclipse.. however i would have expected that once i delete the configuration that contains the state corresponding to those jars.. they should be deleted.. in fact it mentions deleting could free up disk space.
Nov 22 15:25:25 <nboldt>	rgrunber: I just did a revert config. How do you delete a config, other than filesystem `rm -fr ...` ?
Nov 22 15:26:01 <rgrunber>	there's a delete button at the bottom
Nov 22 15:26:24 <rgrunber>	to the left or Revert there is Delete.
Nov 23 05:20:08 <scela>	mistria: the active part stack thing won't go away
Nov 23 05:21:51 <mistria>	scela: that's probably a preview of the hell
Nov 23 05:22:01 <mistria>	scela: in hell, you spend the eternity fixing this bug...
Nov 23 05:22:49 <mbooth>	Weird, I assumed scela's hell would involve lucene in some way...
Nov 23 05:23:39 <scela>	mbooth: actually that bug was my bug first but since I had to handle the lucene hell first, mistria inherited my hell
Nov 23 05:24:02 <mbooth>	:-)
Nov 23 05:24:50 <scela>	mistria: haha, yeah and guess who the devil assigns as your 'QA contact'...
Nov 23 06:52:45 <akurtakov_>	mistria: enjoying CTabFolder :)
Nov 23 06:52:56 <mistria>	akurtakov_: yep
Nov 23 06:53:07 *	akurtakov_ hates this widget
Nov 23 06:54:17 <mistria>	akurtakov_: I like to use it, not really to tweak it
Nov 23 06:54:46 <akurtakov_>	mistria: knowing what it does I hate to just see it :)
Nov 23 08:33:25 <mistria>	akurtakov_: on the CTab, I believe that the 3 "regressions" actually come from 3 different patches and authors
Nov 23 08:33:36 <akurtakov_>	nice
Nov 23 08:33:47 <mistria>	akurtakov_: that's an interesting metric of a breakable this is ;)
Nov 23 08:34:05 <akurtakov_>	and these are actually features not regressions :)
Nov 23 08:34:53 <akurtakov_>	only way to fix it is to delete it
Nov 23 08:36:22 <akurtakov_>	mistria: am I guilty of one ? or I can skip this round :)
Nov 23 08:37:51 <mistria>	akurtakov_: well the sizing is the only bug I see, others are more discussable. If I'm not mistaken, culprits are me, Marc-Andre and Lars, you're clear
Nov 23 08:37:55 <mistria>	so far...
Nov 23 08:38:11 <akurtakov_>	haha ok :)
Nov 23 08:38:38 <akurtakov_>	fwiw, extending the tests for it would help a lot :)
Nov 23 08:42:03 <mistria>	akurtakov_: out of the 3 issues, only the one about sizing could (and should) be automatically tested
Nov 23 08:42:29 <mistria>	akurtakov_: the one about color and icon are more about people having dfferent expectations of the behaviour of the widgetr
Nov 23 08:44:28 <akurtakov_>	so fixing the sizing (mandatory) and adjusting the color icon to the preference of the one doing the work is the solution :)
Nov 23 08:48:15 <mistria>	akurtakov_: how can I try to write an automated test from a SWT Snippet such as the one provided by Niraj?
Nov 23 08:50:25 <akurtakov_>	care to point me to Niraj one?
Nov 23 08:50:33 <akurtakov_>	I might have missed it
Nov 23 08:54:19 <mistria>	ah sorry, meant Stefan
Nov 23 08:54:27 <mistria>	on initial comment
Nov 23 08:57:22 <akurtakov_>	mistria: ah, I see 
Nov 23 08:57:30 <akurtakov_>	not gonna be easy
Nov 23 08:58:52 <akurtakov_>	mistria: for the size you can look at the various test_computeSize methods in tests
Nov 23 09:00:10 <akurtakov_>	but it's quite ugly trying to write these tests
Nov 23 09:01:18 <akurtakov_>	many of the tests will look pointless but at the very lest they verify no segfault happens even if the result is not checked
Nov 23 09:33:41 <mistria>	akurtakov: Can I create a new shell as part of an automated test?
Nov 23 09:38:01 <akurtakov_>	mistria: sure you can
Nov 23 09:47:42 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: hi Mat, please add bz1389302 to the z-stream erratum (https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/25630)
Nov 23 09:48:10 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Sure, will do
Nov 23 09:48:20 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: thanks!
Nov 23 09:54:47 <rgrunber>	akurtakov_: i'm guessing that cdt user asking about scl is in a chicken/egg scenario.. and must manually remove the "root" part of those macros.. since it's the meta-package itself that would have defined them..
Nov 23 09:55:42 <rgrunber>	(scl-utils-build has them.. so maybe they could install that ..)
Nov 23 09:56:33 <mistria>	akurtakov_: tests are still skipped for SWT by default?
Nov 23 09:57:26 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: Jeff was asking 2 days ago why Docker wasn't in the current sprint.
Nov 23 09:58:09 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: nvm seems we are now..
Nov 23 09:59:19 <mistria>	akurtakov: ah no, sorry. misreading
Nov 23 09:59:54 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, he sent me a mail and I provided with explanations. I still need to put my issues in the sprint, though.
Nov 23 10:32:08 <akurtakov_>	mistria: yeah, not running still
Nov 23 10:32:43 <akurtakov_>	mistria: not enough time as always
Nov 23 10:34:34 <mbooth>	vkadlcik: Waiting for rpmdiff to run..... I will switch it back to QE when done
Nov 23 10:36:42 <vkadlcik>	mbooth: ok, thanks
Nov 23 10:44:13 <scela>	rgrunber: that's one big status email :)
Nov 23 10:45:00 <rgrunber>	scela: yeah.. there's a lot of stuff i learned this week.. tried my best to condense.
Nov 23 10:45:32 <rgrunber>	tl;dr stuff happened, i did some stuff, more stuff needing to be done.
Nov 23 10:46:44 <scela>	rgrunber: well we don't call you King of Orbit for nothing ...
Nov 23 10:47:13 <rgrunber>	scela: i'll take 'p2 minion' pretty soon.
Nov 23 10:47:31 <rgrunber>	i even made an nice drawing ! https://rgrunber.fedorapeople.org/droplets-differ.png

Nov 24 05:21:23 <mistria>	scela: want to chat now?
Nov 24 07:34:57 <scela>	mistria: call now?
Nov 24 07:35:05 <mistria>	scela ok
Nov 24 07:35:14 <mistria>	scela: you have a bluejeans channel?
Nov 24 07:35:19 <mistria>	scela: I don't
Nov 24 07:35:27 <scela>	mistria: let me dig that up
Nov 24 07:38:43 <scela>	mistria: https://bluejeans.com/4594613629
Nov 24 11:04:19 <scela>	rgrunber: hi
Nov 24 11:04:23 <rgrunber>	scela: hey
Nov 24 11:04:50 <scela>	rgrunber: so i'm doing this target editor as you know
Nov 24 11:05:09 <rgrunber>	scela: yeah .. i was actually thinking nboldt would have a lot of crazy tp files to test out with.
Nov 24 11:05:32 <scela>	rgrunber: in autocompleting IUs, I want to cache them so on second try it is instantaneous
Nov 24 11:05:38 <scela>	rgrunber: as first time takes a while
Nov 24 11:05:50 <scela>	rgrunber: here's what I have right now for reference https://sopotc.fedorapeople.org/Screencast%20from%2011-24-2016%2004:49:26%20PM.webm
Nov 24 11:05:51 <rgrunber>	ah hmm..
Nov 24 11:06:32 <rgrunber>	yeah yeah.. reading fetching..
Nov 24 11:07:11 <scela>	rgrunber: ok so now, as with all caching, i have to flush the cache
Nov 24 11:07:39 <scela>	rgrunber: can p2 give me some hint on whether it is needed to flush ?
Nov 24 11:07:51 <scela>	rgrunber: maybe you have some hint there 
Nov 24 11:09:19 <scela>	mbooth: nboldt also please take a look at the webm ^ and ping me if you have any hint on the workflow and/or look and feel
Nov 24 11:09:30 <scela>	it's still WIP though so take it easy on me ;)
Nov 24 11:09:44 <rgrunber>	scela: off the top of my head, don't know of a method to tell p2 to flush cache.. the fact that most p2 uis have a button for 'refresh/reloading' repositories tells me it might not be something easy.
Nov 24 11:11:17 <scela>	rgrunber: so what I mean by cache is _my_ cache ( a map of repository URL->List of available IUs ) to make autocompletion very fast after first time
Nov 24 11:11:28 <scela>	this cache i can flush on file open etc.
Nov 24 11:11:52 <rgrunber>	'very dumb solution: invalidate entire cache when user increments seqence number' :P
Nov 24 11:12:41 <rgrunber>	i'm looking at some p2 api.. but i feel one would need to load entire repo metadata to know if something has changed..
Nov 24 11:12:55 <scela>	rgrunber: ah :(
Nov 24 11:13:03 <rgrunber>	hold on.. i have a thought..
Nov 24 11:14:27 <rgrunber>	scela: the artifact repository is generally *much* smaller in size (eg. in orbit 44k for meta, vs 8k for artifact met).. you'd still have to load the artifact repository.. and take advantage of p2.timestamp property or something.. and if you hold timestamp for repos.
Nov 24 11:15:34 <scela>	rgrunber: so I'd compare timestamp of latest change with timestamp of caching
Nov 24 11:16:10 <rgrunber>	scela: or just the p2.timestamp value from the last time you loaded everything.
Nov 24 11:16:54 <scela>	yes the "last time you loaded everything" is the time i filled up my cache
Nov 24 11:16:58 <rgrunber>	this assumes p2 repos have p2.timestamp property.. but afaict most seem to.
Nov 24 11:18:10 <rgrunber>	certainly ones generated by tycho.
Nov 24 11:18:29 <scela>	yeah but I can't be sure of that
Nov 24 11:18:48 <scela>	i mean how the repo was created
Nov 24 11:20:58 <rgrunber>	scela: it still eliminates a lot of cases. i mean you could start taking a case-by-case approach.
Nov 24 11:22:29 <scela>	rgrunber: ok thanks. I'll see how I can handle it.
Nov 24 11:22:34 <rgrunber>	actually even the FeaturesAndBundlesPublisher seems to create p2.timestamp
Nov 24 11:28:51 <scela>	rgrunber: one more thing
Nov 24 11:29:29 <scela>	I use QueryUtil.createIUAnyQuery to get all the IUs
Nov 24 11:29:33 <scela>	which works fine
Nov 24 11:29:47 <scela>	except I need only IDs, irrespective of version
Nov 24 11:29:59 <scela>	so is there a way to query it to give me only unique IDs?
Nov 24 11:30:25 <scela>	and not two or more IUs for same ID (and different version)
Nov 24 11:30:56 <rgrunber>	scela: yeah should be possible.. some kind of unique property or something must exist. one sec..
Nov 24 11:31:26 <rgrunber>	createLatestIUQuery() as a kind of similar thing ?
Nov 24 11:32:05 <scela>	rgrunber: from javadoc it should be it
Nov 24 11:32:07 <scela>	let me try
Nov 24 11:32:08 <rgrunber>	you still get a version.. but just one.. and all the IU ids..
Nov 24 11:33:45 <scela>	yep it works
Nov 24 11:34:04 <scela>	rgrunber: is there also a utility method to get all versions of a given Id?
Nov 24 11:34:14 <scela>	or do i have to come up with it?
Nov 24 11:38:22 <rgrunber>	scela: i would just use QueryUtil.createIUQuery(id) on the repo and just iterate through the versions.. or somet kind of (iu -> iu.getVersion) lambda magic.
Nov 24 11:39:30 <rgrunber>	*mapping using stream()
Nov 24 11:42:04 <scela>	rgrunber: ok
Nov 24 11:43:20 <rgrunber>	scela: yeah wish i could think up something better for your cache issue.. the problem is the info that a repo has changed is in the metadata files and they must be queried somehow.
Nov 24 11:43:58 <scela>	rgrunber: yeah that's understandable
Nov 24 11:43:59 <rgrunber>	so my assumptions are that : generally people update both metadata and artifact repos and not one or the other, so go with the smaller one (artifact repo).
Nov 24 11:45:37 <rgrunber>	scela: oh here's another thing.. you could also store the size of the actual repo.. and then decide whether that risk is worth it.. ie.
Nov 24 11:53:35 <nboldt>	scela: the one thing I'd like to see is if I change the repository location, that the included <unit> versions would be updated automatically.
Nov 24 11:54:35 <nboldt>	scela: or maybe a right-click context menu option for "Update Unit Versions"
Nov 24 11:57:53 <rgrunber>	nboldt: also what's happening with 'sequence number'.. that thing still need to be bumped on every change right ?.. would you do it on behalf of user ?
Nov 24 11:57:56 <rgrunber>	umm scela ^
Nov 24 11:58:37 <scela>	rgrunber: not sure what you call sequence number here
Nov 24 12:00:06 <nboldt>	sequence number? uh... ?
Nov 24 12:00:15 <rgrunber>	scela: https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/452909/ .. i assume it's still needed.. it's the most fun part of target files.
Nov 24 12:01:58 <nboldt>	rgrunber_brb: do you mean the <target name="..."> value? we don't use a sequence number, just an arbitrary name w/ a version in it.
Nov 24 12:01:59 <nboldt>	https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms/blob/4.61.x/jbdevstudio/multiple/jbdevstudio-multiple.target#L2
Nov 24 12:03:14 <scela>	rgrunber_brb: or do you mean "<?pde version="3.6"?>"
Nov 24 12:03:40 <scela>	rgrunber_brb: at least that's what they discuss in the forum post you mentioned. but i think that's relatively rare update
Nov 24 12:04:59 <mbooth>	scela: http://git.eclipse.org/c/ecf/org.eclipse.ecf.git/tree/releng/org.eclipse.ecf.releng.target/ecf-luna.target#n2
Nov 24 12:05:12 <mbooth>	This sequence number is incr every edit
Nov 24 12:05:24 <mbooth>	Is it only to help the old target editor?
Nov 24 12:05:44 <mbooth>	(I.e.: the sequenceNumber="19")
Nov 24 12:06:02 <mbooth>	Or needed by something else?
Nov 24 12:06:43 <scela>	mbooth: no idea, first time i hear about it TBH
Nov 24 12:08:21 <mbooth>	scela: I tripped over it when editing target files in vim -- I can't remember why, maybe the target platform did not refresh in the IDE if the sequence number did not change, or something like that, I don't remember
Nov 24 12:09:39 *	mbooth leaves scela with that spanner in the works :-)
Nov 24 12:10:49 *	scela googles the strange british idiom
Nov 24 12:39:49 <mbenitez>	nboldt, fwiw I don't remember any rpms being built with tech preview metadata when I used to do productization work, everything was explained in rel notes / mktg announcements
Nov 24 12:44:30 <nboldt>	mbenitez: ok, so I probably DON'T have to change anything at this stage? *excellent*
Nov 24 12:45:03 <nboldt>	scela: "a bug in the code" would be the software equivalent of "spanner in the works" 
Nov 24 12:45:07 <mbenitez>	nboldt, yes, I just talked to a couple of the top prod people in EAP prod team and they confirmed
Nov 24 12:45:21 <nboldt>	or "leaving your watch in the patient after sewing them back up" 
Nov 24 12:45:40 <nboldt>	mbenitez: ok, cool. #nothingToSeePleaseMoveAlong
Nov 24 12:45:53 <nboldt>	one less thing I have to worry about today/tomorrow
Nov 24 12:47:13 <scela>	and I thought the first version is strange ...
Nov 24 12:47:36 <mbenitez>	nboldt, you also asked if the location should be 'development', I'm 50/50 about that, because that's usually for something in flux, I think stable is fine with the big bold 'tech preview' notes
Nov 24 12:48:03 <mbenitez>	nboldt, yes, you have other things that are higher prio to use your time
Nov 24 12:55:51 <rgrunber>	scela: nboldt yeah i meant the sequenceNumber attribute of target tag.
Nov 24 12:56:27 <rgrunber>	i supposed it's only pde that cares about it.. tycho probably wouldn't check it.
Nov 24 12:56:39 <nboldt>	mbenitez: so I should stick "Technology Preview" into the HTML on a /stable/ URL? 
Nov 24 12:57:29 <nboldt>	rgrunber: my .target files never touch PDE. we use 'em with maven/tycho only, then point Eclipse @ the resulting target platform update site rather than the .target file
Nov 24 12:57:57 <nboldt>	because AFAIU the current .target file editor in Eclipse will lock up your Eclipse for ~hour while it does stuff in the background
Nov 24 12:58:07 <nboldt>	but it takes seconds to tell it "use this folder as a target platform"
Nov 24 12:59:19 <mbenitez>	nboldt, I don't think it's necessary, unless you want to add an extra layer of information
Nov 24 12:59:47 <nboldt>	ok
Nov 24 15:11:46 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: ping ?
Nov 24 15:42:58 <nboldt1>	rgrunber: poong
Nov 24 15:43:29 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: hey, so about your question.. why don't jars go away when you uninstall, or even when you delete the profile entry.
Nov 24 15:43:37 <nboldt1>	yep
Nov 24 15:43:50 <rgrunber>	deleting the profile entry in that page just deletes the profile.. that's it.
Nov 24 15:44:09 <rgrunber>	i did however find a class that seems to be API that would clean all the jars.
Nov 24 15:44:15 <nboldt1>	cool
Nov 24 15:44:20 <rgrunber>	-application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.garbagecollector.application
Nov 24 15:44:39 <rgrunber>	, or GarbageCollector.runGC(IProfile)
Nov 24 15:45:10 <rgrunber>	afaict nothing actually calls it on the current profile.. PDE uses it to clear out its own profile that it uses in the workspace location.. i'm guessing for its target platform stuff..
Nov 24 15:47:26 <rgrunber>	one slight bug :P the garbage collector deletes things even when Install History still references them.. then when you try to revert.. it kinda tries downloading them.. i think it doesn't find some update sites though..and fails.
Nov 24 15:50:02 <nboldt1>	sounds familiar. we used to have problem w/ uninstalling things because to back up to an old version the update sites listed had to have the OLD version available
Nov 24 15:50:41 <nboldt1>	so to back up from, say, devstudio 9.1 to 9.0 you probably have to find an update site with devstudio 9.0 on it (the default /stable/ URL will have the latest 9.1 only)
Nov 24 15:51:23 <rgrunber>	easy solution would be : add a single line in RevertProfilePage that also garbage collects a profile after it's removed. that seems like the right place.
Nov 24 15:51:45 <rgrunber>	*or before it's removed..
Nov 24 16:09:47 <ipun>	rgrunber, do you know the where  are default settings of plugins retrieved from? Looking to change them for a new workbench creation
Nov 24 16:10:44 <rgrunber>	ipun: if the settings survive a restart then they're probably stored in the workspace somewhere.
Nov 24 16:11:09 <rgrunber>	usually under $workspace/.metadata/.plugins/$pluginId
Nov 24 16:12:31 <ipun>	rgrunber: hmm, is there somewhere for a plugin to "choose" what the default is for a new workbench?
Nov 24 16:12:43 <ipun>	somewhere hidden in the plugin.xml or properties?
Nov 24 16:13:21 <rgrunber>	ipun: ah, that would usually be hardcoded.
Nov 24 16:14:01 <rgrunber>	ipun: is this plugin showing it's settings on the Window -> Preferences ?
Nov 24 16:15:29 <ipun>	rgrunber: no i dont believe so. The plugin is part of Package explorer (nested projects) and I'm trying to investigate how to set it. Its currently defaulting to "flat"
Nov 24 16:17:27 <rgrunber>	ipun: if changing through the UI persists even after a restart then it's likely stored somewhere in $workspace.. or maybe in the workbench.xmi.. not too sure though.
Nov 24 16:21:45 <ipun>	rgrunber: hmm okay. Ill investigate a bit further, thanks!

Nov 28 11:22:56 <ipun>	rgrunber ping 
Nov 28 11:23:01 <rgrunber>	ipun: hey
Nov 28 11:25:52 <ipun>	if i were to run a child eclipse and I want it to include a path, is it some sort of flag you set up in Program arguements?
Nov 28 11:26:19 <ipun>	example: i want my child eclipse to be ran like "./eclipse /some/path/to/file"
Nov 28 11:27:06 <rgrunber>	ipun: yes you could absolutely set it in Arguments of child Eclipse Launch Configuration
Nov 28 11:28:01 <rgrunber>	ipun: how will you be accessing those arguments though ?
Nov 28 11:28:13 <ipun>	rgrunber whats the flag to it? I just added "/some/path" at the end and I dont think my child eclipse is seeing it
Nov 28 11:28:52 <ipun>	typically, when you do "./eclipse /some/file.txt", eclipse would run, you select your workspace, then your file will be opened
Nov 28 11:29:20 <rgrunber>	ipun: ahh hmm.. so this is existing functionality.. one sec..
Nov 28 11:30:36 <rgrunber>	cool didn't know eclipse can be used like that :P
Nov 28 11:31:51 <rgrunber>	ah.. i believe because regular eclipse is launched with :
Nov 28 11:31:56 <rgrunber>	--launcher.defaultAction openFile
Nov 28 11:32:14 <rgrunber>	see https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/OpenFileFeature for easy way to enable
Nov 28 11:32:33 <ipun>	rgrunber amazing, thank you
Nov 28 11:35:34 <ipun>	rgrunber havent gotten it to work just yet, tried putting that in part of the program arguments
Nov 28 11:35:51 <ipun>	are the program arguments there different from the ones that we call in the command line perhaps?
Nov 28 12:03:32 <mistria>	hey SWT experts
Nov 28 12:04:06 <mistria>	do you know whether on Hudson, we do need SWT_GTK3=0?
Nov 29 10:49:19 <ipun>	hey mistria, from my understanding i dont think you need to do SWT_GTK3=0
Nov 29 10:49:26 <ipun>	im pretty sure it supports gtk3 
Nov 29 10:50:00 <mistria>	ipun: can you please remind me about the question? :D
Nov 29 10:50:25 <ipun>	mistria: hahah you asked about if we need SWT+GTK3=0 on hudson
Nov 29 10:50:36 <ipun>	sorry I noticed it just now
Nov 29 10:50:52 <mistria>	ipun: ok, thanks
Nov 29 10:57:35 <mbenitez>	mbooth, people are paying attention to the inforcentre request, we must make sure to take advantage of this wave
Nov 29 11:03:46 <ipun>	mistria: I'm still having a bit of trouble figuring out how to test Bug 500388. Even if i commit it I have no idea how anyone else will test it either unless they compile the whole eclipse
Nov 29 11:08:36 <mistria>	ipun: You can try the following to build an IDE locally with your change (success not guaranteed)
Nov 29 11:08:38 <mistria>	$ cd ~/git/eclipse.platform.ui
Nov 29 11:08:40 <mistria>	$ mvn clean install -Pbuild-individual
Nov 29 11:08:42 <mistria>	$ cd ~/git/eclipse.platform/platform/org.eclipse.sdk
Nov 29 11:08:44 <mistria>	$ mvn clean verify -Pbuild-individual-bundles
Nov 29 11:08:46 <mistria>	Then in the org.eclipse.sdk/target/products folder, you should get the IDE to try. Check it does contain the bundle you're expecting with the right timestamp, and try it.
Nov 29 11:08:51 <mistria>	ipun: I'm going to comment on the bug
Nov 29 11:13:42 <ipun>	mistria: thank you! Ill give it a go
Nov 29 11:55:26 <mbenitez>	nboldt, hello Nick, do you have any docs on how the rpm was built?
Nov 29 11:56:03 <mbenitez>	not building in Brew is 'controversial' but I'm sure we can prove we're not doing anything illegal and that builds are reproducible
Nov 29 11:56:28 <nboldt>	mbenitez: you mean like "here's the job config" and "here's the ./build.sh script" ?
Nov 29 11:56:50 <mbenitez>	nboldt, yes, just saw the link in your last email... must read all next time :P
Nov 29 11:56:51 <nboldt>	I can put those two files into a zip and mail it to someone :D
Nov 29 11:57:01 <nboldt>	lol, I didn't link to the job in the email though
Nov 29 11:57:10 <nboldt>	but it's not doing anything magical
Nov 29 11:58:20 <mbenitez>	since the rpm is going to be tech preview I wouldn't overstress about signing
Nov 29 11:58:33 <mbenitez>	however, it's good to keep this going fwd for when it's needed
Nov 29 11:59:15 <nboldt>	well, I need to know if not being signed is a blocker or not
Nov 29 11:59:22 <nboldt>	if it is, ...we can't release
Nov 29 11:59:33 <nboldt>	if it isn't, we solve this for Marck 7 release
Nov 29 11:59:40 <nboldt>	*March
Nov 29 12:04:00 <mbenitez>	when do you need an answer?
Nov 29 12:04:26 <mbenitez>	I'd say it's not a blocker but... will probably need somebody to back that up
Nov 29 12:05:47 <nboldt>	mbenitez: sooner is better :D 
Nov 29 12:16:58 <mbenitez>	nboldt, let's try this, since RCM will be the actual team to sign, open a ticket with them release-engineering@redhat.com CC siege, mbonnet, timoran, me
Nov 29 12:17:36 <mbenitez>	let's give things today to see what happens, if not tomorrow I can confirm with others at 5x5 if this is a blocker
Nov 29 12:20:21 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: hello Jeff. I've submitted a few small fixes for the Docker tooling today, but the most important one is the "Image Search" fix
Nov 29 12:24:36 <nboldt>	mbenitez: ok, RCM ticket filed
Nov 29 12:24:41 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: ok, I can get at least the one fix in today
Nov 29 12:24:54 <mbenitez>	nboldt, great, thanks
Nov 29 12:25:02 <mbenitez>	mbooth, thank you for the follow ups
Nov 29 12:25:22 <mbooth>	mbenitez: No problem -- too much email
Nov 29 12:25:41 <mbenitez>	indeed :)
Nov 29 12:26:15 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: yes, that would be great. I guess the other ones can wait until next week. Most of them are really small (sometimes even one line) fixes
Nov 29 12:26:38 <jjohnstn>	xcoulon: if they're small enough, I'll get them in too
Nov 29 12:26:47 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: ok, cool
Nov 29 14:54:43 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, do you know where the lastest devstudio rpm is?
Nov 29 14:54:56 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: yes one sec..
Nov 29 14:55:30 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: https://devstudio.jboss.com/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.rpm_master/latest/x86_64/
Nov 29 14:55:42 <rgrunber>	.. at least that's where i tend to get latest ones.. and update sites are there as well.
Nov 29 14:56:06 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, actually a silly question, if this rpm is not signed the only problem is the user can't verify we built it right or is there anything else?
Nov 29 14:56:24 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, thanks! couldn't remember the location
Nov 29 15:00:13 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: yeah if it's not signed and if the user doesn't have the key locally to verify what signed it.
Nov 29 15:01:37 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, thanks again
Nov 29 15:43:03 <mbenitez>	akazakov, thank you for replying to Todd, I think your assessment it correct and no functionality is lost, missing signatures for a tech preview would be mostly a PM call
Nov 29 15:50:23 <akazakov>	mbenitez, yes if no functionality is lost then I hope we can negotiate unsigned devstudio tech preview.
Nov 29 15:51:10 <mbenitez>	akazakov, I think we should be able to
Nov 29 16:19:40 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thanks for all the updates, it's good to see replies from others
Nov 30 08:34:49 <scela>	mistria: hi
Nov 30 08:35:06 <scela>	mistria: for https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=502399 the 'magic wand' icon looks like a wizard
Nov 30 08:36:08 <mistria>	scela:right... please comment on the bug, maybe it will help to figure out something better
Nov 30 08:40:33 <scela>	mistria: done
Nov 30 10:23:03 <rgrunber>	mbooth: any thoughts on rhbz#1399793 ? i can't reproduce at all.
Nov 30 10:27:52 <mbooth>	rgrunber: No, I haven't encountered this either
Nov 30 10:28:25 <rgrunber>	yeah, it's pydev, and aeri failing on jnr stack.. initially i thought it was Docker issue but forgot other things use jnr.
Nov 30 10:28:57 <rgrunber>	afaict mcepl had no broken symlinks.
Nov 30 10:35:49 <mbooth>	TBH, I never usually try using > 1 jnr-using plugin at once -- could it be racy?
Nov 30 10:37:22 <rgrunber>	is download.eclipse.org... unresponsive..
Nov 30 10:37:28 <rgrunber>	nvm.. just slow..
Nov 30 10:37:36 <mbooth_>	mbooth: get outta here
Nov 30 10:38:25 <rgrunber>	mbooth: hmm a possibility.
Nov 30 10:39:25 <rgrunber>	Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can't overwrite cause with java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: could not locate stub library in jar file.  Tried [jni/x86_64-Linux/libjffi-1.2.so, /jni/x86_64-Linux/libjffi-1.2.so]
Nov 30 10:39:31 <rgrunber>	you're onto something..
Nov 30 11:01:15 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, are you joining?
Nov 30 11:01:32 <akurtakov>	yea
Nov 30 11:26:44 <nboldt1>	mbooth_: two artifacts, same id, different versions .. .what about two different IDs, same package exports?
Nov 30 11:27:03 <nboldt1>	could you have one called org.foo.bar.jdk8 and another org.foo.bar.jdk7?
Nov 30 11:27:24 <nboldt1>	but have both exporting the same methods? then they can be versioned and developed independently
Nov 30 11:28:27 <nboldt1>	or, instead of versioning w/ tycho versions plugin to bump everything up ... use jgit timestamp provider so you never have to manually bump x.y.z across the whole project, only at the per-feature/per-plugin level?
Nov 30 11:34:19 <mbooth_>	nboldt1: In fact, annoyingly ECF has a mixture of same ID/different version and different ID/same exports -- both are valid in a project, and all tycho plugins should be able to handle both ways
Nov 30 11:37:17 <scela>	mbenitez: when is the deadline of the compliance training?
Nov 30 11:37:30 <mbenitez>	scela, some time in Jan
Nov 30 11:37:45 <mbenitez>	the noisy weekly reminders say
Nov 30 11:38:13 *	scela has already filtered it
Nov 30 11:38:19 <mbenitez>	:D

Nov 30 11:56:06 <mistria>	scela: or this one is even bigger and still standard https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjWxLr5-NDQAhWIKyYKHUhNBGEQFgg7MAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Femojipedia.org%2Funicode-10.0%2F&usg=AFQjCNEjMFHpmJBUPCuevaAo0yV8ClrHTQ&sig2=xFfaz-POYK0J0WM3YFb4Eg
Nov 30 13:19:13 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: since next team call/meeting is Dec 12, does that mean you want an email-based status report by end of THIS week / Dec 5? Or are we doing an extra-long one that ends Dec 12?
Nov 30 13:26:01 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, we're good with an longer one for the 12th
Nov 30 13:26:14 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: ok, cool
Dec 01 09:15:35 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, jjohnstn, scela don't forget the gmail call in 15 minutes
Dec 01 09:15:51 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: how long would it be ?
Dec 01 09:16:31 <mbenitez>	I don't know, it's scheduled for an hour but guess it depends on the conversation
Dec 01 09:17:48 <akurtakov>	I'll be for 15 mins and will have to leave
Dec 01 09:18:18 <mbenitez>	sure
Dec 01 09:21:48 <mcepl>	hmm, how to invoke the "Send Error" function (not Send Bug)? (trying to reproduce https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1399793#c1 )
Dec 01 10:47:06 <mbenitez>	nboldt, hi Nick, just to confirm, the needinfo in RCM-10070 is for security right?
Dec 01 11:19:03 <nboldt>	mbenitez: um, I guess? I didn't add that flag
Dec 01 11:23:19 <mbenitez>	nboldt, right, I think it was Chris, was just making sure I didn't miss anything
Dec 01 11:23:36 <mbenitez>	nboldt, fyi it seems we'll be able to sign, we should hear something later today
Dec 01 11:23:49 <nboldt>	mbenitez: nah, I think the only thing we missed was ... when discussing how to release the rpm... about a month ago... that it needs to be signed :(
Dec 01 11:25:27 <mbenitez>	nboldt, probably, it never crossed my mind :( oh well if it doesn't go out this time we'll have something much better for the pre-summit release, nothing is wasted work
Dec 01 11:27:42 <nboldt>	yeah, no worries. Kind of amazed that no one thought about signing before Nov 22 when it was suggested to me by QE, iirc.
Dec 01 11:28:09 <mbenitez>	yes
Dec 01 11:28:27 <nboldt>	I suspect it's because (from my perspective) I didn't realize rpms needed to be signed
Dec 01 11:28:55 <mbenitez>	well, as you can see people are releasing stuff in different ways, often without as strict reqs as rhel
Dec 01 11:28:56 <nboldt>	and for the last 8 years devstudio content hasn't been signed despite numerous attempts to tell us we have to sign, then not giving us a way to do so :D
Dec 01 11:29:17 <nboldt>	so we've had an exception to the rule
Dec 01 11:29:50 <mbenitez>	exactly, that's why it is a grey area... on one hand it should be possible for this content to go unsigned as everyhting els devstudio, otoh rpms are signed :\
Dec 01 11:30:46 <nboldt>	this is perhaps the most recent attempt, 3 years ago. https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-13407
Dec 01 11:30:52 <mbenitez>	nboldt, about that exception, remind we should talk to Chris about this, he mentioned there should be a review of devstudio in the ticket [iirc]
Dec 01 11:33:35 <nboldt>	curiously, we got auth to sign via automated process, then it got taken away, then we got told we'd get hardware to allocate a special machine (not a shared one) ... then nothing happened
Dec 01 11:34:07 <nboldt>	so maybe we could sign on wonka itself
Dec 01 11:36:12 <mbenitez>	it's something I expect more pieces in devtools will need [just like the mac installer this time] so I expect there will be a common solution
Dec 01 11:36:19 <rgrunber>	nboldt: were any of the self-service signing sites of any use ?
Dec 01 11:36:23 <mbenitez>	like wonka
Dec 01 11:36:57 <nboldt>	wonka isn't equipped for signing afaik
Dec 01 11:39:14 <nboldt>	yep, rpm-sign isn't installed on wonka or the jenkins vm inside wonka
Dec 01 11:39:30 <nboldt>	but it could be, if we could use that host for such a thing
Dec 01 11:39:42 <mbenitez>	'like', future solution :)
Dec 01 11:40:06 <rgrunber>	ah, and some diy- scp'ing of rpms back and forth between machines is too much of a hastle ?
Dec 01 11:40:35 <rgrunber>	nvm.. need to automate and use someones credentials.. meh.. already sketchy.
Dec 01 11:42:15 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, right, we need something like what errata does automatically
Dec 01 12:31:20 <scela>	akurtakov: ping
Dec 01 12:31:42 <akurtakov>	scela: what's up?
Dec 01 12:31:59 <scela>	so lars has +2 my PDE target editor
Dec 01 12:32:03 <scela>	and +1 verified it
Dec 01 12:32:13 <scela>	he suggests to merge it early M5
Dec 01 12:32:32 <scela>	but also mentions if I badly want it in M4 I can ask vikas for a second opinion
Dec 01 12:32:47 <scela>	do you badly want it in for M4?
Dec 01 12:32:54 <scela>	i'm personally fine with early M5
Dec 01 12:32:57 <scela>	akurtakov: ^
Dec 01 12:33:17 <akurtakov>	scela: let's not rush that much
Dec 01 12:33:22 <akurtakov>	early M5 should be fine
Dec 01 12:33:46 <akurtakov>	having it a week later means we can tackle issues 
Dec 01 12:34:06 <akurtakov>	and it's new bundle and etc. so it will hit on releng either I guess
Dec 01 12:34:36 <akurtakov>	in short I don't want to see it merged on fri and reverted on Wed case it's not ready yet
Dec 01 12:34:37 <scela>	akurtakov: indeed. that's why I also think early M5 is best
Dec 01 12:35:13 <scela>	akurtakov: i also don't want to end up in a situation where I have to take care both of some unexpected lucene issue popping up from more extensive testing in M4
Dec 01 12:35:22 <scela>	and also of this target editor
Dec 01 12:35:51 <scela>	it's also not so much of a breaking change (i'm not even deleting any line of code) so it's just adding stuff
Dec 01 12:35:54 <scela>	thus it can wait
Dec 01 12:36:00 <scela>	ok so that's settled then
Dec 01 12:36:05 <akurtakov>	ye
Dec 01 12:36:06 <akurtakov>	s
Dec 01 12:36:51 <scela>	akurtakov: i think he's also disregarding the CQ issue here so i'll inquire in the meantime
Dec 01 12:39:45 <mbenitez>	nboldt, guess no signatures is the conclusion [according to mojo req for brew]
Dec 01 12:40:02 <mbenitez>	nboldt, is there a hipchat channel where we could talk to tim/todd?
Dec 01 12:40:55 <mbenitez>	if you know
Dec 01 12:46:38 <nboldt>	mbenitez: there's Devsuite room
Dec 01 12:47:08 <nboldt>	akazakov: ^ martha asked for a room in which we can talk to Tim and Todd
Dec 01 13:11:06 <nboldt>	hey, dumb question. can anyone confirm that there are pieces of previously compiled stuff in any of the rh-eclipse46* bundles that are NOT rebuilt in brew from source?
Dec 01 13:11:16 <nboldt>	mbenitez: rgrunber: mbooth_ ^
Dec 01 13:11:35 <nboldt>	or is everything in rh-eclipse46* rpms (except devstudio) all 100% built from source in brew?
Dec 01 13:12:30 <rgrunber>	nboldt: all built from sources.
Dec 01 13:12:47 <nboldt>	rgrunber: damnit. ok, thanks
Dec 01 13:13:09 <mbenitez>	nboldt, yes, everything else is 100%
Dec 02 09:30:07 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: jjohnstn_ just an fyi the hudson server driving the cdt's hipp is down so our builds might fail..
Dec 02 09:32:11 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: ha ok, thanks for letting us know
Dec 02 10:56:59 <mbooth>	I'd probably ignore koschie failures... This seems not eclipse related: "Cannot download toplink/packages/bash/4.3.43/4.fc26/ppc64le/bash-4.3.43-4.fc26.ppc64le.rpm: All mirrors were tried"
Dec 02 11:48:30 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn: I looked at the user guide of the Docker tooling on the Eclipse wiki page and it looks good to me.
Dec 02 13:07:07 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn_: so i think the problem with data missing when copied from container is due to timing. you pass the stream directly to the commons-compress tar class and it stops because it thinks it saw EOF. In fact the EOF is because the full tar stream has been split and is coming over a few segments.
Dec 02 13:07:45 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn_: so i think what needs to happen is you need to collect all the data first, and then pass it to the tar stream.. but not while it might still be arriving, or commons-compress will just stop processing.
Dec 02 13:08:51 <jjohnstn_>	ok, thx for the idea
Dec 02 13:09:13 <rgrunber>	also, afaict symlink data is in the tar stream.. but i don't believe it follows the path.. still i don't thinkk it's responsible for data loss.. more likely what i mentioned above.
Dec 02 13:10:22 <rgrunber>	and haven't reproduced the hang.. although i did notice the copy command needs the container to be in tty mode.. otherwise the directing listing logic just returns '/' with no children.
Dec 02 13:14:55 <jjohnstn_>	again, interesting...are you performing the copy or are you just bringing up the dialog?
Dec 02 13:17:38 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: i'm performing the copy.. the dialog works well assuming tty is enabled for the container.
Dec 02 13:19:39 <rgrunber>	*to clarify.. i'm performing the copy with the dialog..
Dec 02 14:28:54 <jjohnstn_>	rgrunber: are you using 3.6.8 by any chance?
Dec 02 15:11:20 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn_: no i was using 3.4.0 to test.
Dec 02 15:11:53 <jjohnstn_>	rgrunber: and you were able to repeatedly try to copy /bin to a local host directory?
Dec 02 15:12:20 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn_: yes.. not all of it.. but repeteadly, yes
Dec 02 15:12:36 <rgrunber>	* i used '/etc'
Dec 02 15:13:00 <jjohnstn_>	rgrunber: try /bin and let me know if that causes the error
Dec 02 15:14:17 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn_: sure, i'll try all of bin
Dec 02 15:14:39 <jjohnstn_>	rgrunber: I'll try /etc and see if it works similar for me
Dec 02 15:17:23 <jjohnstn_>	rgrunber: /etc fails for me (can't populate root files after the copy)
Dec 02 15:20:06 <rgrunber>	ok i reproduced the hang.
Dec 02 15:20:44 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn_: can you try doing the exact same thing you do to reproduce it.. but over a tcp:// connection instead ?
Dec 02 15:24:06 <rgrunber>	ok.. well this is.. interesting..
Dec 02 15:24:35 <rgrunber>	after reproducing (i think).. i tried just running a 'docker ps' on the connection.. even that hangs..
Dec 02 15:25:13 <rgrunber>	docker images works..
Dec 02 15:26:03 <jjohnstn_>	rgrunber: ok will do with regards to tcp connection
Dec 02 15:29:01 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn_: yeah so it's not just copy that hangs.. commands like 'docker ps' too.
Dec 02 15:31:17 <jjohnstn_>	rgrunber: uggh
Dec 02 16:31:18 <jjohnstn_>	rgrunber: I think I will attempt to work around this by not copying directories but instead copying all the files of the directory and simply creating the directory as needed
Dec 02 16:42:26 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn_: is that the issue.. copying directories ?
Dec 02 16:42:56 <rgrunber>	if so go for it.. at least until we figure out why directories are such an issue..
Dec 02 16:44:02 <jjohnstn_>	rgrunber: it shows up copying directories...no issues so far copying files so I am going to try the kludge to see if it solves the issue

Dec 06 12:37:40 <nboldt1>	 Hey folks who have projects @ Eclipse... do any of you know if your stuff is java9 compatible yet? Asking because an Oxygen requirement MIGHT be to be java9 compliant. https://wiki.eclipse.org/Planning_Council/December_07_2016#Potential_new_requirements
Dec 06 12:38:09 <nboldt1>	jjohnstn: rgrunber: akurtakov: ^ if you need me to voice an opinion on this on tomorrow's call, let me know
Dec 06 12:38:57 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: offhand i recall they only removed some apis i know we don't use and no longer can use '_' as a variable.. anything else..
Dec 06 12:39:00 <nboldt1>	mistria: ^ xcoulon ^
Dec 06 12:39:43 <nboldt1>	could simply be a need to state if projects are "Java 9 ready".
Dec 06 12:45:01 <akurtakov>	nboldt1: java 9 compatible in the sense of "works on Java 9" afaik
Dec 06 12:45:44 <akurtakov>	nboldt1: that's fine requirement for me though 
Dec 06 12:45:58 <akurtakov>	what's explained on the wiki page is the min I would require :)
Dec 06 12:52:36 <mistria>	nboldt1: If Equinox manages to be compatible with Java 9, then I think most projects will be compatible with Java 9
Dec 06 13:00:01 <nboldt1>	cool, just checking in. thanks
Dec 06 13:34:54 <xcoulon>	nboldt1: ok, thanks for the message
Dec 06 14:32:29 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: thanks for the +1s
Dec 06 14:32:44 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: I have concern over httpcore and asm though
Dec 06 14:32:58 <rgrunber>	about standardizing with platform ?
Dec 06 14:38:35 <akurtakov>	and potentially overriding platform versions
Dec 06 14:38:55 <akurtakov>	as usually platform defines in the way [x, x+1)
Dec 06 14:41:05 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: please test the new patch on gtk2
Dec 06 14:41:21 <lufimtse>	ok
Dec 06 14:41:33 <akurtakov>	I do think that what I did for gtk3 should be the same for gtk2 too
Dec 06 14:51:37 <lufimtse>	Tested patch on Gtk2, works well. Or you mean like remove the ifGtk3 bit?
Dec 06 14:52:36 <lufimtse>	ah, you updated new patchset
Dec 06 14:59:09 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I was thinking the same btw. (removing the ifGtk3 split..)
Dec 06 14:59:33 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I somehow missed that the function was in gtk2
Dec 06 15:03:38 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I'll land it in as soon as M4 is announced :)
Dec 06 15:13:43 <jjohnstn|wfh>	rgrunber: any ideas why the mirror url stuff would not be working for the neon stable-5.2 build?
Dec 06 15:15:04 <rgrunber>	stable-5.2 still show updates-nightly for the mirror-repo-name from what i see.
Dec 06 15:15:07 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn|wfh: ^
Dec 06 15:15:13 <rgrunber>	in top-level pom.xml
Dec 06 15:15:55 <jjohnstn|wfh>	rgrunber, ah, I just noticed I failed to merge the patch that fixed that...sorry about that
Dec 06 15:17:04 <rgrunber>	k phew.. only other thing i could think of is that we now generate artifacts.xml.xz and those things don't contain the mirror properties..
Dec 06 15:18:29 <rgrunber>	^ but that probably won't affect things.. i think most queries still use the artifacts.jar file.
Dec 06 15:24:52 <jjohnstn|wfh>	rgrunber: btw, I tried using the archiveContainer interface in an experiment..same failure as before...it is the big awk file that causes the error..perhaps we need to upgrade all our dependencies...docker cp doesn't reproduce because it fails trying to copy /bin/[ and then stops

Dec 08 09:24:39 <scela>	mistria: so frederic is saying 'I'm not giving you more hardware share as other projects might request it too' ?
Dec 08 09:25:56 <mistria>	scela: I don't know exactly what's his goal, but I bet he'll give up
Dec 08 09:26:23 <mistria>	scela: they should just give up the crappy SLES and put CentOS everywhere
Dec 08 09:26:43 <mistria>	scela: if we had more CentOS on Platform, it would be fine to go to 6 executors even
Dec 08 09:27:21 <mistria>	scela: the root issue of CI nowadays is that SLES is not suitable to run some UI tests
Dec 08 09:31:06 <scela>	mistria: i don't think he has a 'goal' in the sense he's trying to achieve something
Dec 08 09:31:32 <scela>	mistria: issue is the actual bottleneck of our development speed now is hardware, which is really bad
Dec 08 09:31:44 <mistria>	scela: he's trying to save some hardware, like most sysadmins like to do
Dec 08 09:31:54 <mistria>	scela; I agree, but I don't think it's hardware
Dec 08 09:32:07 <mistria>	scela: it's just replacing some SLES containers by some CentOS ones
Dec 08 09:32:58 <scela>	mistria: yeah I'll rephrase it to 'hardware support' as I think having the best OS on the hardware is hardware support
Dec 08 09:33:31 <mistria>	scela: there's an architecture council call today, I can try to bring this issue
Dec 08 09:33:35 <scela>	mistria: but anyway, i don't think we should be in such tight spot for an extra slave
Dec 08 09:33:41 <mistria>	scela: Denis and wayne are usually attending
Dec 08 09:34:08 <mistria>	scela: I've got my former laptop still at home, maybe we can send it to the Foundation ;)
Dec 08 09:35:43 <mbenitez>	:D
Dec 08 09:42:22 <scela>	mistria: by the looks of it they might need it
Dec 08 09:46:32 <scela>	mistria: i have still to understand/know what caused this avalanche of IT issues
Dec 08 09:48:38 <mistria>	scela: there are a bit of many things.
Dec 08 09:48:40 <mistria>	The download part is because of bad code
Dec 08 09:48:42 <mistria>	Some general availability because of dying loadbalancer
Dec 08 09:48:44 <mistria>	another one before EclispeCon was a supply issue in the data warehouse where the servers are placed
Dec 08 09:48:46 <mistria>	This one is just SLES having bad XVnc...
Dec 08 09:48:48 <mistria>	every day a new story
Dec 08 09:50:23 <scela>	mistria: what do you mean by 'download part'?
Dec 08 09:51:22 <scela>	mistria: hardware dying is not news, i'm pretty sure hardware has died before in EF infrastructure but it never had this huge impact
Dec 08 09:55:30 <mistria>	scela: the fact that download is between slow and dead every tuesday
Dec 08 09:56:54 <scela>	mistria: and which bad code is responsible for it?
Dec 08 10:01:20 <mistria>	scela: the one that was added in Update Manager in Neon.0 and says "all Eclipse of the worlds, please fetch p2 metadata at the same time on Tuesday""
Dec 08 10:01:37 <mistria>	scela: should be called the Eclipse Botnet project
Dec 08 10:04:49 <scela>	mistria: IIRC the issues we had with dead downloads etc. did not start as early as June
Dec 08 10:05:06 <scela>	mistria: not to mention other dead sites like bugs.* etc.
Dec 08 10:05:54 <mistria>	scela: it's because most people do not update on June
Dec 08 10:06:07 <mistria>	scela: many wait several monthes before updating
Dec 08 10:06:18 <mistria>	scela: especially because of the holidays and so on
Dec 08 10:09:44 <scela>	mistria: tbh out of pure feeling I'm not convinced that's the cause. Did any of the IT guys investigate this and found this as the culprit?
Dec 08 10:12:08 <scela>	ipun: good luck with your eclipse converge presentation
Dec 08 10:13:32 <ipun>	scela thank you, more just curious to see if anyone would like to check it out
Dec 08 10:13:59 <scela>	ipun: a bit longer summary about what you plan to show and whether there will be a demo or not will help
Dec 08 10:14:20 <ipun>	scela okay ill add to it!
Dec 08 10:14:43 <scela>	ipun: 2 sentences in total looks unusually short to me :)
Dec 08 10:15:09 <scela>	ipun: it's a pretty important topic i think, especially for eclipse on linux
Dec 08 10:23:45 <rgrunber>	ipun: there was a talk at fosdem on wayland by someone from samsung, video+slides included ( https://archive.fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/enlightenment_of_wayland/ ) might be useful to look at what kind of topics they went into.
Dec 08 10:28:11 <ipun>	rgrunber awesome thank you!
Dec 08 10:28:37 <ipun>	should be helpful to add to my summary + slides if I do get selected
Dec 08 10:33:34 <rgrunber>	for Eclipse the argument seems to be, decoupling from X allows us to potentially render Eclipse in all sorts of crazy places on linux, hopefully keeping the IDE relevant.
Dec 08 10:34:32 <ipun>	rgrunber its a good argument. I think Eclipse is still "relevant" at the current moment, but its good they are looking into the future

Dec 14 06:15:00 *	akurtakov wonders how many others like https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/87118/ there are
Dec 14 06:18:43 <akurtakov>	scela: so Vikas send an email saying he will look into the target editor during the weekend
Dec 14 06:18:45 <akurtakov>	sigh
Dec 14 06:19:14 <akurtakov>	yet another case where we should not wait for IBM
Dec 14 06:19:30 <akurtakov>	if Lars has submitted the CQ most probably IP team woul dhave approved it by now
Dec 14 06:22:02 <scela>	akurtakov: ok
Dec 14 06:22:37 <scela>	akurtakov: it's unfortunate indeed
Dec 14 06:23:05 <akurtakov>	scela: I more and more believe that IBM india is pushed way too much for IBM products giving them very little time for oss projects
Dec 14 06:23:31 <akurtakov>	scela: just try to not wait/depend on IBM at much as possible
Dec 14 06:23:48 *	akurtakov really believes IP team could have handled this case faster
Dec 14 06:24:33 <scela>	akurtakov: yeah I've experienced these delays myself and I'm not a fan of them
Dec 14 06:24:44 <scela>	akurtakov: but in this case lars decided to ask vikas
Dec 14 06:25:26 <scela>	akurtakov: I tried to bypass it to speed things up but it seems it backfired :(
Dec 14 06:25:52 <akurtakov>	shortcuts take a lot more time quite often :)
Dec 14 11:05:19 <mbenitez>	akurtakov_, having fun with google docs? ;)
Dec 14 11:05:30 <akurtakov_>	mbenitez: definetely :)
Dec 14 11:05:47 <rgrunber>	that's the spirit..
Dec 14 11:12:23 <akurtakov_>	lufimtse: ipun: reverting the patch - you should know why I was afraid of touching older versions :)
Dec 14 12:15:55 <nboldt>	hey, lufimtse... https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-3595 want some work? 
Dec 14 12:16:18 <lufimtse>	hey
Dec 14 12:16:36 <nboldt>	someone's triaging our old issues so I'm seeing spam in my inbox
Dec 14 12:16:52 <nboldt>	wondering if you want to help w/ dark theme stuff in Eclipse /devstudio
Dec 14 12:17:07 <nboldt>	note when this was opened and by whom :D
Dec 14 12:17:19 <lufimtse>	nboldt, hey, the projcet explorer dark theme should already be fixed in recent builds
Dec 14 12:17:28 <nboldt>	*cough* akurtakov_ ^
Dec 14 12:17:28 <lufimtse>	I don't know about front page thou.
Dec 14 12:18:26 <lufimtse>	nboldt, maybe after webkit2 port is complete :-). At the moment I'm sort of postponing everything till that works.
Dec 14 12:18:30 <nboldt>	ah, so this is more about an html page that doesn't flip its CSS (loaded from an external source) if you're in dark mode
Dec 14 12:18:44 <nboldt>	I'll bug Fred instead
Dec 14 12:19:34 <mbenitez>	nboldt, or Ian [ ipun ]
Dec 14 12:20:26 <ipun>	ah yes the dark theme...
Dec 14 12:22:43 <akurtakov_>	nboldt: webkit2 is priority :)
Dec 14 12:23:00 <akurtakov_>	we can talk once lufimtse gets it done :)
Dec 14 12:24:46 <akurtakov_>	nboldt: actually if it's html page the fix should be in the page itself
Dec 14 12:25:11 <akurtakov_>	to get a param somehow for the theme used
Dec 14 12:25:26 <akurtakov_>	and flipping the css based on it
Dec 14 12:25:42 <akurtakov_>	much like editor highlighting does it
Dec 14 12:27:51 <nboldt>	akurtakov_: yes, the page is loaded from external server (or cached as part of the install). Pinged Fred in HC and he'd need to get Design to do something w/ CSS and then we'd need code to check which mode was on in Eclipse (dark/normal) then display the correct CSS. But not a high priority
Dec 14 12:28:42 <akurtakov_>	nboldt: so it's again a low engineering effort, high synchronization costs task :)
Dec 14 12:31:57 <nboldt>	akurtakov_: and probably low customer gain, too
Dec 14 12:32:42 <akurtakov_>	tbh, it can't be less than desktop eclipse in docker :)
Dec 14 12:46:50 <mbenitez>	btw I mentioned the eclipse in docker efforts in the devtools PM list and there are not votes to prioritize that so no new commitments in that area
Dec 14 12:47:14 <akurtakov_>	mbenitez: \o/ :)
Dec 14 12:48:41 <mbenitez>	indeed :)
Dec 14 13:01:43 <rgrunber>	phew
Dec 15 07:11:27 <scela>	akurtakov_: i remember you always update via check for updates
Dec 15 07:11:39 <akurtakov_>	scela: yes, why?
Dec 15 07:11:45 <scela>	akurtakov_: did you observe something like https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=509253
Dec 15 07:12:23 <akurtakov_>	scela: nope
Dec 15 07:13:45 <scela>	akurtakov_: ok
Dec 15 07:14:02 <scela>	akurtakov_: what worried me is that he's saying he's trying with a fresh M3
Dec 15 07:15:18 <akurtakov_>	scela: why does it worry you ?
Dec 15 07:15:42 <scela>	akurtakov_: the fact that a fresh M3 is not able to be upgraded to M4
Dec 15 07:15:50 <scela>	akurtakov_: or is able to but fails on start
Dec 15 08:57:37 <nboldt>	mbenitez: jmaury: what are the success criteria for devstudio release this time around? I added two on slide 3 of the goals deck. also see that on slide 4, rpm moves from Tech Preview to GA; but on slide 3 it's still Tech Preview ... ? https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XEwm08fPP2qEtUqko90HpoQtzhQSdWLHDuev75p_oUM/edit#slide=id.g137b60479a_39_0
Dec 15 09:00:53 <mbenitez>	nboldt, I think we should remove the tech preview qualifier, that should be our goal as we talked yesterday
Dec 15 09:01:04 <mbenitez>	that was there because of the various issues
Dec 15 09:01:15 <mbenitez>	Brew is another layer, that will only come with time
Dec 15 09:01:44 <nboldt>	mbenitez: I was under the impression that if we called it GA we'd have to sign it formally
Dec 15 09:01:52 <nboldt>	which would require brew
Dec 15 09:02:11 <nboldt>	I'll ping siege to confirm that we can dev-key-sign the bits if it's not tagged Tech Preview
Dec 15 09:02:44 <mbenitez>	ok
Dec 15 09:03:42 <mbenitez>	I think what rel-eng cares about is not using the best key for something built out of Brew, but we may be able to call it what we see fit just like devstudio itself
Dec 15 09:05:12 <nboldt>	mbenitez: yeah, I'm happy using the dev key for a GA RPM but I'd like a clear statement from RCM and SecOps that they're ok with that so we don't get in a panic a week from GA :D
Dec 15 09:33:59 <nboldt>	jjohnstn_: you mentioned yesterday that linux tools is at v 5.3.0 now for Oxygen?
Dec 15 09:34:11 <nboldt>	(am I remembering that number correctly?)
Dec 15 09:57:49 <mbenitez>	PSA: Jim Whitehurst town hall in 3min https://primetime.bluejeans.com/a2m/live-event/my99788
Dec 15 10:57:20 <nboldt>	jjohnstn_: want to ask a question the townhall about investment in Google tech ? :D
Dec 15 10:57:51 <mbenitez>	:D
Dec 15 11:04:26 <rgrunber>	of the self driving kind
Dec 15 11:10:43 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: yes, I bumped up Linux Tools non-Docker to 5.3.0 and Docker Tooling to 2.3.0 ahead of the Neon.3 release...this is currently in our Oxygen M4 offering
Dec 15 11:12:27 <nboldt>	jjohnstn jjohnstn_ oh, so 5.3.0 is for BOTH Oxygen.0.M4 and Neon.3?
Dec 15 11:13:33 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: yes...we almost always work towards the next release which will be 5.3.0 and when we cut the branch, we will up master to be 6.0.0 which is the real Oxygen release
Dec 15 11:14:59 <nboldt>	ok, cool... so for my bzira rht-bugzilla-to-ERT-JIRA scraper I need to add 6.?.0 ==> Oxygen.\1 ?
Dec 15 11:15:12 <nboldt>	do you have those fixversions in bugzilla yet?
Dec 15 11:15:15 <nboldt>	jjohnstn ^
Dec 15 11:15:36 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: not sure, but I'll check
Dec 15 11:18:37 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: just added 5.2.0 as release and 5.3.0/6.0.0 milestones in bugzilla
Dec 15 14:55:58 *	scox is away: airport, return Sun
Dec 16 11:56:55 <scela>	rgrunber: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=509363
Dec 16 11:57:19 <scela>	rgrunber: not sure how this guy has core lucene 5.2.1
Dec 16 11:57:26 <scela>	rgrunber: maybe he's strict on his dependencies
Dec 16 11:59:10 <rgrunber>	it's the help code that's failing though ?..
Dec 16 12:00:10 <rgrunber>	could be a bug in the 6.x Orbit bundles.. we might need to be more strict.. one sec..
Dec 16 12:00:42 <scela>	rgrunber: the failure is deep in the lucene guts AFAICS, rather than the consuming code in help
Dec 16 12:00:50 <rgrunber>	yeah
Dec 16 12:01:18 <rgrunber>	looks like lucene-util 6.x calls 5.x bundle.. hmm
Dec 16 12:01:54 <rgrunber>	* lucene-core
Dec 16 12:04:59 <scela>	rgrunber: that's strange
Dec 16 12:08:19 <scela>	how does lucene-core 6.1 declare its deps?
Dec 16 12:08:20 <rgrunber>	scela: i'm not seeing anything weird in the wiring..
Dec 16 12:08:54 <rgrunber>	scela: in fact it has no deps.
Dec 16 12:09:55 <scela>	rgrunber: so when you said 6.x calls 5.x which bundles did you mean?
Dec 16 12:10:12 <rgrunber>	i was assuming that must happen to get the classcastexception
Dec 16 12:12:51 <scela>	so this thing ships with a lucene-core 5.2.1 of its own
Dec 16 12:16:04 <scela>	rgrunber: he is basically using the lucene-core 5.2.1 rather than 6
Dec 16 12:18:53 <rgrunber>	scela: in the stacktrace Lucene60Codec is only in lucene-core 6.x.. and all the classes after are also in lucene-core 6.. so not sure how it would have gotten 5.
Dec 16 12:29:31 <scela>	rgrunber: yeah it seems it's a cast failure interally in lucene
Dec 16 12:29:48 <scela>	as usually when it's a version mismatch you get a different error
Dec 16 12:29:55 <rgrunber>	scela: yeah but i can't see how lucene-core 6 would get classes from 5.. they don't even show as wired ..
Dec 16 12:30:41 <scela>	rgrunber: maybe he's provinding a pre-built index built with 5.2.1
Dec 16 12:31:00 <rgrunber>	scela: however looking in NamedSPILoader from lucene 6 i see it playing with classloaders.. trying to get the parent classloader for the current one.
Dec 16 12:31:10 <scela>	rgrunber: but normally lucene would pop a indexformattoooldexception
Dec 16 12:34:36 <scela>	rgrunber: yeah there's some hard-core reflection going on there
Dec 16 12:50:55 <scela>	rgrunber: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=509363#c3
Dec 16 12:51:09 <scela>	he's saying there's no pre-built index, just including 5.2.1
Dec 16 12:52:55 <rgrunber>	i'll try it out
Dec 16 12:53:06 <rgrunber>	.. p2 issues when you try to install?
Dec 16 12:53:39 <scela>	i installed one version but the thing wanted me to sign up for trial version
Dec 16 12:53:54 <scela>	last comment he made has another update site
Dec 16 12:54:05 <scela>	https://www.ctrlflow.com/trial/install/#updateSite
Dec 16 12:55:11 <scela>	http://download.ctrlflow.com/updates/public/stable seems to be the p2 site
Dec 16 12:57:54 <scela>	rgrunber: no issues while installing
Dec 16 13:02:07 <rgrunber>	scela: yeah same for me.. i've got lucene 6 (4 bundles) and lucene 5 (3 bundles), and 1 from lucene 3.
Dec 16 13:02:28 <rgrunber>	nothing fails in help.. except some lucene errors parsing mlyn docs.. seems unrelated.
Dec 16 13:02:43 <scela>	rgrunber: would you please comment also on the bug?
Dec 16 13:02:49 <rgrunber>	sure
Dec 16 13:02:53 <scela>	rgrunber: thanks
Dec 16 13:04:32 <rgrunber>	scela: did you try going to help through the ctrlflow UI ?
Dec 16 13:04:57 <rgrunber>	in Code Search view.. from the drop down, Help -> Manual
Dec 16 13:05:06 <rgrunber>	still works just fine
Dec 16 13:05:20 <scela>	yep works fine
Dec 16 13:05:30 <scela>	rgrunber: i've asked him for steps to reproduce
Dec 16 13:39:22 <scela>	rgrunber: i guess he's off for the weekend :)
Dec 16 13:40:17 <mbenitez>	Alex? yes, he took today off
Dec 16 13:40:49 <scela>	mbenitez: : no some guy we were discussing with on a bug 
Dec 16 13:40:59 <scela>	mbenitez: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=509363
Dec 16 13:46:18 <rgrunber>	scela: yeah.. still a bit concerning though.
Dec 16 13:48:56 <scela>	rgrunber: i have an idea actually
Dec 16 13:49:08 <scela>	maybe this needs to be done on a fresh install otherwise the indexing is not triggered
Dec 16 13:49:28 <scela>	basically unzip, install this thing and _then_ search for first time
Dec 16 13:49:37 <rgrunber>	hmm /me tries..
Dec 16 13:49:47 *	scela too
Dec 16 13:51:46 <rgrunber>	still seems to work.
Dec 16 13:52:09 <rgrunber>	i opened the help through the ctrlflow view
Dec 16 13:52:27 <scela>	yep works for me too
Dec 16 13:53:53 <scela>	i opened it through normal help also
Dec 19 09:59:21 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: status reports due by weekly call in 1hr
Dec 19 10:03:01 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: you'll get hard time getting them with many people away already :)
Dec 19 10:03:12 <rgrunber>	i'll have it in :P
Dec 19 10:03:26 <rgrunber>	but yeah.. i guess that's why it was posted to the list friday :P
Dec 19 10:03:28 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, that's expected, it's that time of the year
Dec 19 10:04:09 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, that and to give you all more time to do the report as opposed to one hour before the mtg
Dec 19 10:04:32 <rgrunber>	;)
Dec 19 10:08:43 <mistria>	hi all!
Dec 19 10:08:46 <mistria>	mbn
Dec 19 10:09:15 <mistria>	mbenitez: are you availablew for a chat?
Dec 19 10:10:03 *	akurtakov sent it
Dec 19 10:10:15 <mbenitez>	mistria, hello, welcome back
Dec 19 10:10:20 <rgrunber>	oh.. i was actually searching for what acronym mbn is..
Dec 19 10:10:45 <mbenitez>	mistria, I'm almost done with a call, can we meet in 20min?
Dec 19 10:10:48 <mistria>	sure
Dec 19 10:10:57 <mbenitez>	cool, thanks
Dec 19 10:28:16 <mbenitez>	mistria, ready now
Dec 19 10:29:00 <mistria>	mbenitez: ok, can you please remind me the bluejeans url to use?
Dec 19 10:29:10 <mistria>	mbenitez: or is it the same as weekly meetings?
Dec 19 10:29:11 <mbenitez>	mistria, sure: 6709 833 118
Dec 19 10:29:19 <mbenitez>	yes, it's the same

Dec 20 12:25:00 <rmartinelli>	akurtakov: ping. do you have a minute?
Dec 20 12:25:13 <akurtakov>	rmartinelli: sure, what's up?
Dec 20 12:26:15 <rmartinelli>	akurtakov: I just upgraded my laptop to Fedora 25 and I noticed tha after the upgrade I noticed my Eclipse is always returning "SWTError: No more Handles" message. Do you know if it's a known issue?
Dec 20 12:26:37 <akurtakov>	rmartinelli: first time I hear
Dec 20 12:26:44 <rmartinelli>	oh
Dec 20 12:26:49 <akurtakov>	you run on wayland or X11?
Dec 20 12:27:08 <akurtakov>	rmartinelli: care to try GDK_BACKEND=x11 eclipse
Dec 20 12:27:42 <rmartinelli>	akurtakov: I'm almost sure it's X11, but lemme check.
Dec 20 12:28:56 <akurtakov>	rmartinelli: nothing weird on your side like vnc, remote , enforce gtk2|mozilla or similar ?
Dec 20 12:29:06 <rmartinelli>	akurtakov: GDK_BACKEND seems to solve the issue.
Dec 20 12:29:23 <akurtakov>	rmartinelli: also your eclipse is fedora rpm-ized eclipse ?
Dec 20 12:29:38 <akurtakov>	or something else  as fedora one should do this automatically
Dec 20 12:29:53 <rmartinelli>	akurtakov: Not really, but it's the Red Hat packaged IDE: Red Hat Develoepr Studio.
Dec 20 12:30:21 <rmartinelli>	akurtakov: Anyways, Setting GDK_BACKEND solved even the awful problems in GUI rendering.
Dec 20 12:30:26 <rmartinelli>	akurtakov: Thank you so much!
Dec 20 12:30:57 <akurtakov>	rmartinelli: np, spread the word - Eclipse in Fedora JUST WORKS (tm)
Dec 20 12:31:32 <akurtakov>	rmartinelli: so fyi you're probably running on wayland
Dec 20 12:31:38 <rmartinelli>	akurtakov: Will do, for sure.
Dec 20 12:31:45 <akurtakov>	in order to not have to specify the env variable
Dec 20 12:31:53 <rmartinelli>	akurtakov: And thanks for the valuable information. =D
Dec 20 12:32:03 <akurtakov>	on gdm login screen you can choose Gnome on X11
Dec 20 12:32:14 <akurtakov>	and it will use X11 not wayland for everything

Jan 04 10:58:28 <akurtakov>	jetty 9.4 update just worked - quite a surprise :)
Jan 04 11:13:00 <xcoulon>	jjohnstn_: rgrunber: hello and Happy New Year ;-)
Jan 04 11:14:18 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: just got your last email, so if it's ok for mbenitez, I'll get in touch with the conference organizers once we know exactly which one goes presenting the talk ;-)
Jan 04 11:14:29 <akurtakov>	happy new year to everyone too :)

Jan 04 11:15:01 <xcoulon>	akurtakov: happy New Year to you too, Alexandar !
Jan 04 11:15:26 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: I hope you'll have fun in San Jose. I really wished I could go, but I think I'll be too busy on ALM anyway
Jan 04 11:16:04 <rgrunber>	xcoulon: yeah just waiting to hear from jjohnstn|wfh if there's any Board related thing that require him to go anyways.
Jan 04 11:16:22 <rgrunber>	.. or if he really wants to give that talk. it's a great chance to present the Docker stuff.
Jan 04 11:17:56 <mbenitez>	xcoulon, that makes sense, thank you
Jan 04 11:18:20 <xcoulon>	rgrunber: yes, it is a great opportunity, indeed!

Jan 04 15:16:01 <rgrunber>	nboldt: just wondering, has it ever been considered to run devstudio, or even other jboss products against a database of known CVEs (eg. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check)
Jan 05 09:24:15 <akurtakov>	scela: hopefully I haven't broke things with ecf update so we can see the result of comparator fixes you did tomorrow :)
Jan 05 09:25:04 <scela>	akurtakov: if we get a build that is...
Jan 05 09:25:21 <akurtakov>	scela: yeah :)
Jan 05 09:26:40 <akurtakov>	it's gonna be tricky to get all the builds in row with maven updates pending, egit pending, ant pending
Jan 05 09:26:55 <akurtakov>	and we would better deliver them sooner than later
Jan 05 09:31:51 <akurtakov>	scela: at least we are fast getting rid of many obsolete things that David wasn't willing to touch :)
Jan 05 09:45:04 <scela>	akurtakov: yes
Jan 05 09:45:20 <scela>	akurtakov: sravan deserves a lot of credit
Jan 05 09:45:36 <scela>	akurtakov: i guess it's not the easiest job to inherit david's stuff during these times
Jan 05 09:49:29 <scela>	akurtakov: and he's been very helpful in enabling this progress by reacting relatively fast
Jan 05 10:15:12 <akurtakov>	scela: yeah, I don't want to be in his place
Jan 05 10:22:38 <akurtakov>	it's really easy to work with him
Jan 05 10:23:19 <scela>	akurtakov: i also had the same experience
Jan 05 10:23:30 <scela>	quite responsive considering all different things he has to deal with
Jan 05 10:23:40 <akurtakov>	scela: btw, any news on the target editor ?
Jan 05 10:23:59 *	akurtakov needs it now that editing target files is like my job :)
Jan 05 10:24:32 <scela>	akurtakov: i'm waiting for the review again from vikas
Jan 05 10:24:39 <scela>	i was planning on pinging him tomorrow
Jan 05 10:24:53 <scela>	akurtakov: i addressed all of his concerns
Jan 05 10:25:03 <akurtakov>	what about the cq ?
Jan 05 10:25:08 <akurtakov>	will one be needed ?
Jan 05 10:25:25 <scela>	he didn't get back to me on that question

Jan 05 10:26:05 <scela>	and one above
Jan 05 10:57:13 <rgrunber>	yes, infra seems to be down..
Jan 05 10:57:23 <rgrunber>	@eclipse
Jan 05 11:01:17 <rgrunber>	d'oh.. scheduled..

Jan 05 11:07:29 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: ah, git/hudson works for me so I wondered what you speak of :)
Jan 05 11:07:37 <akurtakov>	it's *only* web :)
Jan 05 11:23:05 <nboldt>	rgrunber: test driving dependency-check thing against an installed version of devstudio... wondering what it does with plugin folders (not plugin jars)
Jan 05 11:25:44 <nboldt>	2017 CVE database only takes 1 ms to process. 2011 took 80 seconds. Not a good year for secops, apparently. :D
Jan 05 11:27:15 <nboldt>	aaand.... this is pretty cool. CVEs found in maven.core, openshift tooling, stacks and webservices... tern... 
Jan 05 11:27:33 <rgrunber>	some may be false positives. it has various analyzers.
Jan 05 11:28:22 <nboldt>	rgrunber: found a problem with o.e.linuxtools.docker.editor too. cc: jjohnston (who's afk)
Jan 05 11:29:08 *	nboldt goes to wrap a Jenkins job around this so I can link to it and scare people PgM :D
Jan 05 11:29:33 <mbenitez>	nice :D
Jan 05 11:29:34 <rgrunber>	nboldt: what's the docker.editor cve say? it's gotta be in a dependency, i would think..
Jan 05 11:30:08 <nboldt>	rgrunber: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search-results?adv_search=true&cves=on&cpe_version=cpe%3A%2Fa%3Adocker%3Adocker%3A1.0.0
Jan 05 11:30:25 <rgrunber>	ahh.. so it links to docker itself.
Jan 05 11:30:27 <nboldt>	8 different CVEs
Jan 05 11:30:29 <nboldt>	yep
Jan 05 11:30:46 <nboldt>	docker 1.0 through 1.6
Jan 05 11:30:55 <nboldt>	and 1.11.1
Jan 05 11:31:11 <nboldt>	for example http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1034.html
Jan 05 11:33:06 <rgrunber>	yeah, it's good to know. i woudl plan to run this against orbit but asked in a bug about process for being approved to host it on a hipp.
Jan 05 11:33:46 <rgrunber>	nboldt: also i don't think it checks folders :(
Jan 05 11:35:13 <rgrunber>	i guess you could always jar up folders just before :P
Jan 05 11:35:15 <nboldt>	yeah, in Jenkins I'll have it fetch update site zips and unpack them
Jan 05 11:36:35 <rgrunber>	it has a jenkins plugin btw.
Jan 05 11:36:48 <rgrunber>	https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/OWASP+Dependency-Check+Plugin
Jan 05 11:36:55 <rgrunber>	not sure if it's better yet.. reading
Jan 05 11:39:03 <nboldt>	rgrunber: looks cool as far as charting progress from bad to good states
Jan 05 11:39:05 <nboldt>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4237
Jan 05 11:39:19 <nboldt>	^ issue for tracking this new work item in Jenkins 
Jan 05 11:41:23 <rgrunber>	:) sweet, btw --disableAssembly just disables the .NET assembly analyzer.. it was giving me some trouble with certain Orbit bundles.. it claimed to detect .dll/.exe file but couldn't find mono/some interpreter for it on my system.
Jan 05 11:44:31 <nboldt>	can't find this plugin as an available install in CCI Jenkins

Jan 17 05:01:58 <scela>	akurtakov: it's fixed
Jan 17 05:02:08 <akurtakov>	ok
Jan 17 08:12:26 <akurtakov>	scela: we may need to jump on lucene 6.4 earlier than expected
Jan 17 08:21:04 <scela>	akurtakov: how early?

Jan 17 08:23:09 <akurtakov>	as soon as 6.4 is out maybe
Jan 17 08:23:53 <scela>	akurtakov: i suppose you mean making another round of upgrade for Oxygen?
Jan 17 08:24:00 <akurtakov>	yeah
Jan 17 08:24:02 <scela>	akurtakov: wouldn't that be too disruptive?
Jan 17 08:24:31 <akurtakov>	scela: well, we are supposed to release working ide in august for java 9
Jan 17 08:29:51 *	scela weeps
Jan 17 08:30:49 <scela>	so the issue here is that anything older than 6.4 won't work with java 9?
Jan 17 08:30:59 <scela>	akurtakov: ^
Jan 17 08:31:09 <akurtakov>	I think so
Jan 17 08:31:23 <akurtakov>	but it must be tried whether the help system works with java 9 now
Jan 17 08:31:28 <scela>	but this is runtime thing right
Jan 17 08:31:40 <akurtakov>	?
Jan 17 08:32:19 <scela>	what version will the IDE itself be run on?
Jan 17 08:32:26 <scela>	right now our minimum is 8
Jan 17 08:33:35 <akurtakov>	yeah, but it would have to run on 9 too (once it's released) IMHO
Jan 17 08:33:58 <scela>	are we talking about oxy.0 here ?
Jan 17 08:36:25 <akurtakov>	scela: no, oxygen.1
Jan 17 08:36:26 <akurtakov>	https://wiki.eclipse.org/Oxygen/Simultaneous_Release_Plan#Schedules
Jan 17 08:36:41 <akurtakov>	but updating lucene in .1 release would be a no go
Jan 17 08:38:05 <akurtakov>	scela: so what we need to know is whether the help system in latest Ibuild works with latest java9 build
Jan 17 08:38:31 <akurtakov>	if help system doesn't expose the issue we should be free from doing this update for oxygen
Jan 17 08:38:36 <scela>	where do I get the latest java9 build to try
Jan 17 08:38:45 <akurtakov>	scela: https://jdk9.java.net/download/
Jan 17 08:39:03 <scela>	akurtakov: so no fedora-friendly package?
Jan 17 08:39:06 <akurtakov>	scela: if there is issue though - we would need to plan 
Jan 17 08:39:26 <akurtakov>	scela: there is https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/omajid/openjdk9/ but it's too old 
Jan 17 08:39:59 <scela>	akurtakov: jre should be enough right
Jan 17 08:40:10 <akurtakov>	scela: yup
Jan 17 08:40:49 <scela>	akurtakov: i somehow had the feeling that if you put eclipse on jre9 right now, help system would be least of your worries :)
Jan 17 08:41:23 <akurtakov>	scela: Dani's team should have taken care of the basic things by now
Jan 17 08:45:29 <mbenitez>	eclipse team: Carl's all hands cal in ~15min https://primetime.bluejeans.com/a2m/live-event/nx34696
Jan 17 08:51:28 <scela>	akurtakov: i get the javax annotation issue if I run a fresh eclipse with jre9
Jan 17 08:51:59 <akurtakov>	scela: what's that issue :)
Jan 17 08:53:13 <scela>	akurtakov: i fixed that by adding --add-modules=java.se.ee from https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/java-9-support-beta-oxygen
Jan 17 08:53:28 <scela>	fired up fresh eclipse (with fresh configuration area which holds the indexes) and fresh workspace
Jan 17 08:53:34 <scela>	everything seems to work fine
Jan 17 08:53:40 <mbenitez>	FYI: agenda is basically New performance review system, Salary review cycle, RH Summit
Jan 17 08:54:35 <scela>	akurtakov: I'd probably have to try the build also as that is where the indexing happens
Jan 17 08:55:18 <akurtakov>	scela: is search working fine ?
Jan 17 08:56:35 <scela>	searching yes
Jan 17 08:57:16 <scela>	akurtakov: i tested normal and wildcard ones
Jan 17 08:57:21 <scela>	akurtakov: searching and highlighting works
Jan 17 08:57:31 <akurtakov>	phew, that's good
Jan 17 08:57:40 <akurtakov>	so lucene indexing worked
Jan 17 08:57:52 <akurtakov>	so we are good for now :)
Jan 17 08:57:53 <scela>	not much indexing happens as most of the stuff is pre-built
Jan 17 08:58:01 <scela>	it's just merging 
Jan 17 08:58:10 <scela>	but yeah it seems ok
Jan 17 08:58:45 <scela>	akurtakov: i think the real heavy-weight indexing happens during build
Jan 17 08:58:58 <akurtakov>	scela: java build?
Jan 17 08:59:14 <akurtakov>	this is different index though not lucene related
Jan 17 08:59:27 <scela>	akurtakov: no I mean the normal eclipse sdk maven build
Jan 17 08:59:35 <scela>	where the doc.isv etc. are pre-built
Jan 17 08:59:47 <scela>	with that ant task, remember?
Jan 17 09:00:01 <scela>	akurtakov: ^
Jan 17 09:00:03 <akurtakov>	scela: ah, we would continue building wiht java 8 so no issue
Jan 17 09:00:22 <akurtakov>	but you would have to install few additional plugins that don't ship prebuild indexes
Jan 17 09:00:38 <akurtakov>	and do search again so indexing happens with running help system
Jan 17 09:04:36 <scela>	akurtakov: i went into the zips and deleted the pre-built indexes of jdt and friends
Jan 17 09:04:57 <scela>	akurtakov: retried, it reindexed them from scratch and brought the same number of results
Jan 17 09:05:00 <scela>	so it's a good sign
Jan 17 09:05:05 <akurtakov>	sounds good
Jan 17 09:23:28 <scela>	akurtakov: anyway if you think this might be needed still, ping me and I'll quickly produce an estimate of the effort
Jan 17 09:23:45 <akurtakov>	scela: not for now
Jan 17 09:23:57 <akurtakov>	I was afraid of this crashing with latest java 9
Jan 17 09:24:00 <scela>	akurtakov: i'd only do it if it is really really necessary, as we've just told people to prepare for 6.1
Jan 17 09:29:34 <scela>	akurtakov: i don't think I use MMapDirectory so we might not be vulnerable there
Jan 17 09:29:53 <akurtakov>	scela: I checked that
Jan 17 09:30:06 <akurtakov>	but it could have potentially used it internally
Jan 17 10:17:06 <mbenitez>	nboldt, thank you for that note! I was going to ask you about it since I didn't copy all the info from bluejeans
Jan 17 10:19:06 <nboldt>	mbenitez: GMTA :D
Jan 17 10:19:34 <mbenitez>	:)
Jan 17 10:24:38 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: having a minor issue with building eclipse-cdt for master...the DSF gdb tests are failing to import the org.hamcrest.Matchers...hamcrest and hamcrest-core are are loaded and dsf gdb has been altered to use org.hamcrest.core in the Manifest...any ideas?
Jan 17 10:35:59 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: in hamcrest 1.3 I don't see Matchers. There is a 'Matcher'.. I do see CoreMatchers, so possible class rename ?
Jan 17 10:39:23 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I'll try that..it would be a horrible API breakage if it is true
Jan 17 10:40:04 <rgrunber>	i don't see it used at all in 9.1.. so i'm looking upstream.. to see if they changed something..
Jan 17 10:49:48 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: actually it should be in the hamcrest library package from the main package (not hamcrest-core)
Jan 17 11:20:53 <mbooth>	jjohnstn, rgrunber: Some background: There is no "org.hamcrest" bundle in Fedora (this is invented in orbit to import all the various hamcrest bundles and re-export them) so in Fedora we have to explicitly require the hamcrest bundles we actually need
Jan 17 11:26:46 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: using org.hamcrest.library fixed the problem...thx
Jan 17 11:29:13 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: great :) .. i'm still at a loss because i couldn't find "org.hamcrest.Matcher" being used in 9.2.0.. so unless it's some indirect thing..
Jan 17 11:31:07 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: one of the dsf tests does import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.containsString ...etc..
Jan 17 11:33:57 <rgrunber>	ah yeah.. and that's in library.. true.
Jan 17 11:37:09 <mistria>	rgrunber: hi, what's the best resource to find out the current best way to add a new bundle to Orbit?
Jan 17 11:42:41 <rgrunber>	mistria: hey one sec
Jan 17 11:43:20 <rgrunber>	http://git.eclipse.org/c/gerrit/orbit/orbit-recipes.git/tree/README.md .. i've also rewritten https://wiki.eclipse.org/Orbit/Adding_Bundles_To_Orbit_In_5_Minutes
Jan 17 11:43:57 <mistria>	rgrunber: thanks a lot
Jan 17 11:44:43 <rgrunber>	mistria: and of course there are plenty of examples in the commits of orbit-recipes.. although those will show you the final state of things that get submitted.. so it's maybe a good last comparison.
Jan 17 11:45:02 <rgrunber>	i'm guessing this is about 'joni'
Jan 17 11:48:13 <mistria>	rgrunber yep
Jan 17 11:48:30 <mistria>	rgrunber: any concern/tip on this topic?
Jan 17 11:50:11 <akurtakov>	mistria: I didn't want to bring this on ipzilla (although I do it usually) to not slow down the momentum around the stuff you run
Jan 17 11:50:24 <akurtakov>	but try not add old versions to orbit
Jan 17 11:50:37 <mistria>	akurtakov: ok
Jan 17 11:50:42 <akurtakov>	aka before requesting cq , check whether it's latest
Jan 17 11:50:43 <rgrunber>	joni depends on org.jcodings , and asm .. asm should be ok.. but is jcodings also being added ?
Jan 17 11:50:54 <akurtakov>	and if not update to latest
Jan 17 11:51:11 <akurtakov>	mistria: this workflow prevents a lot of work on fedora/scl side of things
Jan 17 11:51:45 <akurtakov>	aka it's either add old version in orbit and use it + do additional work on fedora/scl
Jan 17 11:51:56 <mistria>	akurtakov: ok
Jan 17 11:51:59 <akurtakov>	or update to latest version + add to orbit
Jan 17 11:52:08 <akurtakov>	the later is way better approach long term
Jan 17 11:52:10 <mistria>	akurtakov: I just checked versions here, and it seems awkward indeed
Jan 17 11:53:08 <rgrunber>	is there a cq for https://github.com/jruby/jcodings ?
Jan 17 11:53:16 <rgrunber>	'Java-based codings helper classes for Joni and JRuby'
Jan 17 11:53:32 <mistria>	akurtakov: not that awkward actually, I have to create a CQ for 2.1.11 then
Jan 17 11:53:54 <rgrunber>	hmm indeed there is
Jan 17 11:54:11 <mistria>	rgrunber: https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10635
Jan 17 11:54:20 <mistria>	rgrunber: not sure it's the latest version though
Jan 17 11:55:03 <mistria>	rgrunber: nope, latest is 1.0.18, CQ is for 1.0.8
Jan 17 11:55:38 <rgrunber>	as long as it matches what the joni version could use.
Jan 17 11:56:30 <rgrunber>	yup, at 2.1.2, jcodings required was 1.0.8
Jan 17 12:06:01 <akurtakov>	sigh, another battle with Dani 
Jan 17 12:06:49 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: and https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=509935 please 
Jan 17 12:07:43 <akurtakov>	for the I-build 
Jan 17 12:08:00 <akurtakov>	I assume doing additional I-build is not much burden 
Jan 17 12:08:15 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: it's fine.
Jan 17 12:09:06 <akurtakov>	scela: fwiw, I would ask Sergey to nominate you as committer once the patch editor is in
Jan 17 12:20:17 <akurtakov>	mistria: scela: are you reading https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/platform-text-dev/
Jan 17 12:20:25 <akurtakov>	there is question for the generic editor
Jan 17 12:22:51 <nboldt>	mbooth: ping? Wondering if you plan to bump rh-java-common-slf4j-simple to 1.7.5
Jan 17 12:23:10 <nboldt>	as part of RHSCL 2.4 / move to Neon.2 / move to m2e 1.7.1
Jan 17 12:38:21 <mbooth>	nboldt: No, I did't plan to
Jan 17 12:44:50 <nboldt>	hmm, ok
Jan 17 12:45:14 <nboldt>	I'll see if I can convince fred to unbundle it from m2e 1.7.1 so we're not in conflict
Jan 17 12:45:18 <nboldt>	mbooth: thx
Jan 17 12:46:32 <akurtakov>	as a rule of thumb I like "whoever has the newer version wins, the rest have to adapt" :)
Jan 17 12:49:32 <mbenitez>	+1
Jan 17 12:50:36 <mistria>	akurtakov scela: I'll take the question for the Generic Editor
Jan 18 04:56:39 <akurtakov>	mbooth: do we apply any patches to build against batik 1.8 ?
Jan 18 04:57:34 <mbooth>	akurtakov: No
Jan 18 04:57:40 <akurtakov>	mbooth: perfect, thanks
Jan 18 10:05:33 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: i'll start some of the cq work, saw the bugs.
Jan 18 10:27:20 <rgrunber>	is the eclipse committer portal slow/unresponsive for anyone else
Jan 18 10:50:12 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: thanks
Jan 18 10:50:29 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: there is way too much heat with the cves lately
Jan 18 10:51:05 <rgrunber>	i was seeing a lot is a result of that.. is this all directly from David's post?
Jan 18 10:51:53 <akurtakov>	directly and indirectly
Jan 18 10:52:08 <akurtakov>	few different channels happened to interfere at the same time
Jan 18 12:36:34 <mistria>	scela akurtakov: If I write a plain SWT app (no RCP, no theming), and have the GTK theme set to dark, should the app be following GTK theme and be dark by default?
Jan 18 12:44:25 <akurtakov>	mistria: yes
Jan 18 12:45:04 <akurtakov>	mistria:  if you have started it with GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark or you have set the global setting
Jan 18 12:45:30 <akurtakov>	mistria: note that if you flip prefer dark theme via gtk inspector on already running app
Jan 18 12:45:30 <mistria>	akurtakov: ok
Jan 18 12:45:43 <mistria>	akurtakov: thanks
Jan 18 12:45:54 <akurtakov>	this will have the side effect of gtk constants being from light theme thus a bit weird
Jan 18 12:47:32 <akurtakov>	mistria: ^ hope that helps
Jan 18 12:47:55 <mistria>	akurtakov: thanks, it helps
Jan 18 12:48:22 <mistria>	akurtakov: trying to debate with another devs who says the the theming of IntelliJ on Mac is more integrated then Eclipse IDE on Linux
Jan 18 12:48:52 <mistria>	akurtakov: I just wanted to be sure he was totally wrong before telling him ;)
Jan 18 12:48:55 <akurtakov>	mistria: I have no idea about swing on Mac :)
Jan 18 12:49:28 <mistria>	akurtakov: Swing has themes, and "mimics" OS drawings; it doesn't reuse them
Jan 18 12:49:40 <akurtakov>	but if e4 theming is disabled on linux you get a stock gtk theme
Jan 18 12:49:50 <mistria>	akurtakov: so it may look nicer if themes are properly maintained, but it's not more integrated
Jan 18 12:56:38 <akurtakov>	mistria: I don't know swing on linux has always be terrible

Jan 19 11:57:32 *	Now talking on #eclipse
Jan 19 11:57:32 *	Topic for #eclipse is: Eclipse discussions
Jan 19 11:57:32 *	Topic for #eclipse set by akurtakov!~akurtakov@vpn1-5-170.ams2.redhat.com (Tue May 17 08:53:56 2016)
Jan 19 12:00:57 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: scela sorry.. new benefits provider was at the office.. was a presentation.
Jan 19 12:01:13 *	rgrunber reads..
Jan 19 12:02:43 <rgrunber>	yeah Gorkem i would think works on THym, or at least I remember watching him do a demo on Apache Cordova.. so i'd go to him for that stuff.
Jan 19 12:02:46 <rgrunber>	oo mistria too :)
Jan 19 12:04:09 <rgrunber>	scela: not necessarily.. i mean before that generally was the format.. with some exception.. ie. 4 segments..
Jan 19 12:04:16 <rgrunber>	with orbit-recipes, format can be something like 0.12.0.v20161107-2054.jar
Jan 19 12:04:25 <rgrunber>	s/.jar//
Jan 19 12:04:36 <scela>	rgrunber: i see
Jan 19 12:05:36 <rgrunber>	it's a format i could change.. as i see the property.. or maybe bring it up..
Jan 19 12:09:01 <scela>	yeah I'm not so much interest in changing it, rather have a feeling of how it looks so I can make the editor smarter
Jan 19 12:09:11 <rgrunber>	ah i c.
Jan 19 12:10:14 <rgrunber>	i mean format for qualifer could be anything configurable in tycho-buildtimestamp-jgit, so not sure how much you can assume about them..
Jan 19 12:13:37 <scela>	rgrunber: right I see
Jan 19 12:14:14 <rgrunber>	i guess if you wanted to make some assumptions about the common case.. might look at all versions in neon/oxygen or something
Jan 19 12:15:07 <scela>	rgrunber: i do have a suite of .target files from which I can have a feeling of the general pattern
Jan 19 12:42:47 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: here?
Jan 19 12:42:51 <rgrunber>	yes
Jan 19 12:43:24 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: have you seen Sravan's mail about icu4j ?
Jan 19 12:43:32 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: err, comment on bz
Jan 19 12:43:41 <akurtakov>	can ebr handle local jars ?
Jan 19 12:44:38 <rgrunber>	i don't see anything on BZ 509935
Jan 19 12:45:04 <rgrunber>	ah nvm i see it
Jan 19 12:48:51 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: not yet, they would still need to be uploaded to repo.eclipse.org. 
Jan 19 12:51:59 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: do you have permissions to do that ?
Jan 19 12:56:40 <rgrunber>	one sec i'm just reading through the bug.. we have a nexus repo and the ability to deploy from a HIPP but i'm seeing if it's even possible for a user to do it manually onto the nexus repo
Jan 19 13:05:56 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: btw, feel free to stress on IBM about that
Jan 19 13:06:04 <akurtakov>	they should stop doing sh*ts with icu4j
Jan 19 13:06:26 *	akurtakov suffered enough wiht it when was taking care of the fedora/rhel builds
Jan 19 13:06:55 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: afaict there's no way to manually upload to our nexus instance.. i'll need to set up another hipp that reads some location that committers have access to..
Jan 19 13:07:29 <rgrunber>	and committers can just scp jars there and have them picked up by the hipp that deploys to nexus.
Jan 19 13:07:44 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: do you even want this to happen?
Jan 19 13:08:07 <rgrunber>	it was discussed in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=484633 so it was eventually meant to be a possibility.
Jan 19 13:09:35 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: ok, I'm just asking
Jan 19 13:09:43 <akurtakov>	not my favorite feature
Jan 19 13:09:46 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: and the bug on the nexus side https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=484631 .
Jan 19 13:10:04 <rgrunber>	i don't like having to create a hipp that does this.. and having committers scp stuff.
Jan 19 13:10:08 <akurtakov>	someone somewhere @ibm handed these jars to Sravan
Jan 19 13:10:16 <rgrunber>	would hav ebeen nice if the web ui allowed jar uploads or something..
Jan 19 13:10:16 *	akurtakov is not convinced at all
Jan 19 13:10:42 <akurtakov>	even more that we just inject metadata 
Jan 19 13:10:49 <akurtakov>	for fedora/rhel builds
Jan 19 13:11:12 <rgrunber>	David's post on that topic cites exactly icu4j..
Jan 19 13:20:04 <rgrunber>	just curious.. what does ibm do differently for icu4j.. and have they thought of upstreaming the changes ?
Jan 19 13:20:07 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: ^
Jan 19 13:20:38 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: they bulid icu and icu.base bundles 
Jan 19 13:20:57 <akurtakov>	whre the later one is some kind of icu4j api without the implementation 
Jan 19 13:21:05 <akurtakov>	that just redirects to jvm 
Jan 19 13:21:09 <akurtakov>	or smth close to that
Jan 19 13:28:01 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: and yet when they applied for the CQ they submitted icu4j from the website ()http://download.icu-project.org/files/icu4j/58.2/icu4j-58_2-src.jar)
Jan 19 13:28:23 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: it's supposed to be build from same sources
Jan 19 13:28:33 <akurtakov>	with some "creative" releng
Jan 19 13:28:36 <rgrunber>	ah ok, fair enough.
Jan 19 13:28:43 <akurtakov>	whihc should be even in their build.xml
Jan 19 13:28:48 <akurtakov>	that's what I've been told
Jan 19 13:30:03 <rgrunber>	i'll see if i can get a hipp up and running that checks for new jars on /shared/orbit/something..
Jan 19 13:30:59 <rgrunber>	worst case it would be in by M6.. things like commons.fileupload i can push in now.. and jsch is already in along with xz.
Jan 19 13:31:17 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: push what you can
Jan 19 13:31:32 <akurtakov>	e.g. if we can get smth for M5 do it
Jan 19 15:59:10 <mistria>	akurtakov: Gorkem is the lead for thym, I've only helped with releng. Rastislav Wagner and Pavol Srna (DevStudio QE) is also contributors
Jan 20 10:12:03 <mbenitez>	mbooth, hello Mat, how's the rhscl going?
Jan 20 10:12:47 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Pretty good, currently doing the obligatory end-of-week errata waiving exercise
Jan 20 10:13:44 <mbenitez>	mbooth, then I won't distract you, let me know if you need anything
Jan 20 10:54:03 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Okay every is ready except one thing: https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/26326
Jan 20 10:54:31 <mbooth>	mbenitez: Missing some product listings for builds that are new (they are only generated once a day, IIRC)
Jan 20 10:55:34 <mbenitez>	mbooth, that's is great! the listings issue you think it's something that'd be corrected later or do we need a ticket for releng?
Jan 20 10:56:07 <mbooth>	mbenitez: I already sent mail to releng, but I guess jira hasn't eaten it yet, because I don't see the ticket when I looked just now
Jan 20 10:56:25 <mbenitez>	mbooth, one step ahead :)
Jan 20 10:57:00 <mbenitez>	mbooth, just let jorton know about this in #software-collections please
Jan 20 10:57:04 <mbooth>	Sure
Jan 20 11:25:31 <mbooth>	nboldt1: I guess it's time to update your devstudio buildroots -- m2e should be available in the SCL now
Jan 20 11:27:01 <nboldt1>	mbooth: ok, cool. thanks!
Jan 20 11:27:20 <nboldt1>	m2e 1.7.1 you mean? and the latest webtools M3.8.2? and neon.2?
Jan 20 11:28:24 <mbooth>	m2e 1.7.1 yes, to pull in the slf4j changes from last time
Jan 20 11:38:49 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Hmm, what would M3.8.2 of webtools be? Just latest head of R3_8_maintenance branches?
Jan 20 11:53:49 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: if you get icu4j earlier please let us know on the bug with the new orbit repo, I mean not for M5 but at anytime during M6
Jan 20 11:54:19 <akurtakov>	icu4j is a piece of nightmare so I don't expect its update to be without issues thus we would better have more than a week to deal with it
Jan 20 11:54:52 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: yes, i'll let you know as soon as it's in on that bug.
Jan 20 11:54:58 <akurtakov>	thanks
Jan 20 14:58:25 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I am trying to add a third page to the Run Image Wizard...every attempt I make, including copying the first page with new id  shows nothing on the page...page shows up with title I give it, but won't show any widgets etc...not even a composite with single label...I use -clean...any suggestions would be welcomed
Jan 20 15:01:15 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: is there any way to copy exactly the previous page and just update the ids.. ? there's probably some strange stuff going on with scrolled composites where things won't show unless you render them in the correct composite.
Jan 20 15:02:16 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I tried exactly that...I am trying another idea to explicitly set the layout which isn't done in our WizardPages
Jan 20 15:03:22 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: could there be something in plugin.xml that needs updating ?
Jan 20 15:07:06 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: couldn't find any references to the pages or count of pages
Jan 20 15:11:06 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: have you tried inserting your page as the first or second page, in case there's something the current second page is doing that causes this but is overlooked because it's last ?
Jan 20 15:19:17 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I have managed to break the 2nd page now as well...when I move the third page to number 2, it is also broken...lots of space at top and only a few fields show up...third page is blank
Jan 20 15:19:33 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I also tried a fresh workspace
Jan 20 15:20:29 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: trying Eclipse update now..
Jan 20 15:52:46 <patrickm>	akurtakov: when do you arrive in Brno next Thursday?
Jan 20 15:58:50 <nboldt1>	mbooth: oops, thought I'd sent you the details on which build to take
Jan 20 16:04:43 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: still failing...
Jan 20 16:07:05 <nboldt1>	mbooth: https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms/blob/4.62.x/jbosstools/multiple/jbosstools-multiple.target#L404 --> webtools/M-3.8.2-20161120000053 
Jan 20 16:11:52 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: probably some bug exists in how the wizard page is done, not sure what it could be though.
Jan 20 16:12:15 <rgrunber>	i know some pages modify the composite passed into createControl.. maybe it's there..
Jan 20 16:45:26 <akurtakov>	patrickm: yes, next thu
Jan 20 16:45:46 <patrickm>	akurtakov: in time for dinner?
Jan 20 16:46:50 <akurtakov>	patrickm: should be
Jan 20 16:46:57 <akurtakov>	3pm landing in Vienna
Jan 20 16:47:09 <akurtakov>	so at 6 I should be at the hotel
Jan 20 16:47:43 <patrickm>	ok, that'll work... i'm in at the brno airport @ 11:55am... then a few hours sleep... then dinner
Jan 20 16:49:17 <akurtakov>	patrickm: perfect

Jan 23 11:48:14 <nboldt>	akurtakov:  I used to only use only FF too, but then I tasted the Chrome kool-aid and while the location bar isn't as good as FF's for keyboard shortcuts, the browser's better in other ways
Jan 23 11:58:12 <akurtakov>	nboldt: chrome or chromium ?
Jan 23 11:58:56 <nboldt>	akurtakov: um... I run chrom* on linux and chrom* on windows. whatever Google gives me when I download it I install
Jan 23 11:59:39 <akurtakov>	it somehow feels way slower than fff
Jan 23 12:00:14 <nboldt>	you mean fff---- ? :D
Jan 23 12:00:41 <akurtakov>	haha
Jan 23 12:01:17 <nboldt>	I find regularly restarting chrome w/ all my prev tabs helps performance, especially of pages using kerberos login
Jan 23 12:01:30 <akurtakov>	if someone has an idea why chromium is so much slower  on scrolling I'm open to try otherwise it will probably stay as bluejeans only app :)
Jan 23 12:03:06 <nboldt>	this helps w/ kerb login pages:  /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --auth-server-whitelist="*.redhat.com" 
Jan 23 12:03:34 <nboldt>	maybe you have it set to scroll at a slower # of pages per mousewheel tick?
Jan 23 12:03:56 <nboldt>	akurtakov: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromium-wheel-smooth-scr/khpcanbeojalbkpgpmjpdkjnkfcgfkhb?hl=en ?
Jan 23 12:04:21 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i'm seeing https://paste.fedoraproject.org/535169/ (in mylyn) when i attempt to load from existing task repository. did something change in neon.2 for lucene in terms of packaging ?
Jan 23 12:07:00 <akurtakov>	nboldt: I haven't done anything :)
Jan 23 12:08:09 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: thanks, that's better :)
Jan 23 12:11:01 <rgrunber>	hmm ?
Jan 23 12:11:10 <rgrunber>	ah that you haven't done anything on lucene?
Jan 23 12:24:22 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Hmm, the only lucene related thing that I changed recently was moving epp-logging from lucene 5 to lucene 4 -- is it possible that there are not-strict-enough requirements in mylyn and osgi is wiring the wrong dep?
Jan 23 12:25:45 <mbooth>	rgrunber: (Does it spring back into life if you uninstall epp-logging?)
Jan 23 12:26:12 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i can try.. although debugging it.. it seems to find ForUtil from lucene 5 and it's wired correctly.
Jan 23 12:26:27 <rgrunber>	however ForUtil has this static initializer.. and according to my debugging it fails in there..
Jan 23 12:26:34 <mbooth>	Hmm
Jan 23 12:26:58 <mbooth>	Never a dull moment with Lucene....
Jan 23 12:27:07 <rgrunber>	fails on something from PackedInts.Format.values() i believe..
Jan 23 12:27:13 <rgrunber>	in ForUtil.java static initializer
Jan 23 12:29:50 <rgrunber>	yeah still fails without lucene4..
Jan 23 12:30:48 <rgrunber>	welp.. that's a new one..
Jan 23 12:31:01 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Then I have no better ideas at the moment :-(
Jan 23 12:31:07 <nboldt>	"Never a dull moment with Lucene" ... that needs to be a meme
Jan 23 12:31:29 <rgrunber>	mbooth: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/535180/ .. never seen this before.
Jan 23 12:32:51 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I have seen this when mismatched lucene versions get wired together
Jan 23 12:33:07 <nboldt>	maybe... http://www.memecreator.org/meme/one-does-not-simply-expect-lucene-to-work-after-an-update ?
Jan 23 12:33:34 <rgrunber>	but i only see lucene5 bundles.. there's no lucene 3, or 4 anywhere in my runtime now.
Jan 23 12:35:02 <rgrunber>	m2e has its own lucene 3 bundles but those aren't exposed.. i don't think..
Jan 23 12:43:18 <rgrunber>	ok weird.. it works now.. hmm
Jan 23 12:43:40 <rgrunber>	i just deleted my .eclipse folder.
Jan 23 12:44:06 <rgrunber>	works on every workspace
Jan 23 12:44:49 *	rgrunber quietly walks while whistling..
Jan 23 13:29:01 <nboldt>	mbooth: just tried to update to latest eclipse bits from rhscl2.4 and got this:
Jan 23 13:29:03 <nboldt>	Error: Transaction check error:
Jan 23 13:29:03 <nboldt>	  file /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop from install of rh-eclipse46-eclipse-platform-1:4.6.2-4.2.el7.x86_64 conflicts with file from package eclipse-platform-1:4.6.1-6.fc24.x86_64
Jan 23 13:29:11 <nboldt>	known issue?
Jan 23 14:09:37 <akurtakov>	nboldt: you're not supposed to install rhscl on top of fedora
Jan 23 14:09:42 <akurtakov>	it's not an issue really
Jan 23 14:10:02 <akurtakov>	rhscl is for rhel where there is no eclipse.desktop file
Jan 23 14:36:22 <nboldt>	akurtakov: well, this worked for 2.3 / fedora 24. and now it prevents install
Jan 23 14:36:28 <nboldt>	so... I need a workaround :(
Jan 23 14:36:41 <nboldt>	or I can't test rpm installs w/o firing up a separate machine (or vm)
Jan 23 14:37:45 <nboldt>	ah, I think the problem is I was installing eclipse-* packages to test jbosstools copr rpm... and they conflict with rh-eclipse46-eclipse-* packages
Jan 23 14:38:46 <nboldt>	so I guess I do need to start using a RHEL vm for this to avoid crossing the streams
Jan 23 15:36:58 <rgrunber>	not the nicest way to do things.. but it's possible https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/orbit-approved-artifacts/org/eclipse/orbit/icu4j/58.2.0.v20170118/
Jan 24 09:01:48 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: RH developers monthly call about to start https://primetime.bluejeans.com/a2m/live-event/my92883
Jan 24 09:06:10 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: has it started ?
Jan 24 09:06:30 <akurtakov>	"we will begin to broadcast shortly"
Jan 24 09:06:40 <akurtakov>	I'm just checking it's not bluejeans joke again
Jan 24 09:08:07 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, just now
Jan 24 09:08:20 <mbenitez>	:)
Jan 24 09:10:26 <akurtakov>	ok :)
Jan 24 10:41:17 <mbooth>	nboldt: Relevant to the chat on here last night: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1416085
Jan 24 10:41:49 <mbooth>	nboldt: Václav gives a good reason to keep the old .dektop file name :-)
Jan 24 11:13:53 <nboldt>	mbooth: yep, this would prevent me being unable to have BOTH fedora eclipse and rh-eclipse46-devstudio co-installed
Jan 24 15:06:14 <ipun>	rgrunber: could i update the macbook to a newer version?
Jan 24 15:06:21 <rgrunber>	sure
Jan 24 15:06:23 <rgrunber>	feel free

Jan 26 17:02:12 <rgrunber>	nboldt1: was going to confirm that maven GAVs need to uniquely identify content across all repositories.. pretty sure it's a yes..
Jan 26 17:03:34 <rgrunber>	so like someone wanting to host their own repo, changing com.ibm.icu:58.2 and calling it the same thing.. would be bad even if their repo was strictly private..

Jan 27 13:32:01 <ipun>	is anyone familiar with how to test koji builds from fedora?
Jan 27 13:32:11 <ipun>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=17440885 this one specifically
Jan 27 13:34:46 <rgrunber>	ipun: you need to test a kernel specifically ?
Jan 27 13:34:54 <ipun>	rgrunber yeah
Jan 27 13:35:30 <rgrunber>	ipun: could you update your system to that kernel version (download the rpms and install..)
Jan 27 13:36:07 <rgrunber>	then just reboot.. and that version should be an option in the grub selection screen
Jan 27 13:38:32 <ipun>	rgrunber: i cant seem to see the link to download that rpm there
Jan 27 13:38:58 <ipun>	rgrunber: ah nvm i found it
Jan 27 13:39:07 <rgrunber>	yeah you can also just click on them
Jan 27 13:39:30 <rgrunber>	ipun: also you don't need to download all of them.
Jan 27 13:39:57 <rgrunber>	just do a : rpm -qa | grep $(uname -r) .. and see what packages come up.. you should only need to download the corresponding version for those.

Jan 30 11:57:10 <rgrunber>	nboldt: our .feature.group update situation should be improved in the next release of devstudio. the reason .feature.groups weren't present was a plain old bug.
Jan 30 13:33:25 <nboldt>	rgrunber: bug in where? 
Jan 30 13:33:45 <nboldt>	also, woo! good news
Jan 30 13:34:11 <rgrunber>	you may have had a bug on the jira side for it.. i dont't think there was one on the Fedora side.
Jan 30 13:34:44 <rgrunber>	.feature.group IUs for features that were installed didn't show up as updates but as things to be installed..
Jan 30 13:35:21 <nboldt>	oh, right. the ICONS in the help > install new dialog show as new items rather than updates to existing
Jan 30 13:35:33 <nboldt>	hmm. not sure there was a jira for that
Jan 30 13:36:06 <rgrunber>	now that .feature.group are generated, they should show up as proper updates.
Jan 30 13:36:22 <rgrunber>	s/generated/detected/
Jan 30 13:38:06 <nboldt>	hmm, I don't see that as a linked issue in the RHSCL 2.4 JIRA epic
Jan 30 13:38:08 <nboldt>	https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4210

Jan 30 14:15:52 <rgrunber>	I guess I can share my joy of Federer winning a grand slam with everyone :P
Jan 30 15:02:18 <nboldt>	hey, anyone know a way to browse an update site looking for all references to a given Require-Bundle in a manifest?
Jan 30 15:02:42 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ^ maybe just rip open the site metadata files and look for it?
Jan 30 15:03:42 <rgrunber>	nboldt: Require-Bundle shows up as a special kind of requirement.. one sec..
Jan 30 15:03:55 <rgrunber>	so you could search the p2 metadata itself for it..
Jan 30 15:06:47 <rgrunber>	one sec...
Jan 30 15:06:52 <nboldt>	<required namespace='osgi.bundle' name='javax.servlet' range='[2.6.0,4.0.0)'/>  ?
Jan 30 15:06:57 <rgrunber>	bingo
Jan 30 15:07:10 <rgrunber>	namespace is java.package only for import-package
Jan 30 15:07:21 <nboldt>	crap. so we have a bug in org.eclipse.wst.server.preview in that it requires-bundle, not imports-package
Jan 30 15:07:37 *	nboldt plays a sad trombone for the devstudio rpm
Jan 30 15:08:06 <rgrunber>	nboldt: slight caveat might be that it doesn't necessarily mean it isn't coming from p2.inf or whatnot.. might check that.. but yeah generally it's from a manifest.
Jan 30 15:12:11 *	nboldt wonders if a regular devstudio install actually uses org.eclipse.wst.server.preview 
Jan 30 15:13:17 <nboldt>	crap, yes it does. :(
Jan 30 15:13:19 <rgrunber>	IU: org.eclipse.wst.server_adapters.feature.feature.group 3.2.500.v201606081655

Jan 30 15:13:37 <nboldt>	yep
Jan 30 15:13:55 *	nboldt goes to report a bug in WTP
Jan 30 15:17:07 *	rgrunber is just impressed no one has come up with Require-Bundle-Alias or something yet out of sheer anger.
Jan 30 15:24:05 <nboldt>	lol
Jan 31 10:16:25 <rgrunber>	mbooth: thnx, that's exactly the bug i was considering.. i'll try to reproduce..might have to locally patch rh-eclipse to try..
Jan 31 10:17:17 <mbooth>	rgrunber: No worries, I read last night's chat this morning and thought "that sounds familiar..."
Jan 31 10:17:19 <rgrunber>	the thing is, org.eclipse.platform.ide isn't provided by a droplet.. it's the base platform.. and my initial reaction is to say it would only be provided as an update if a newer version existed in a p2 repo.. which is quite likely..
Jan 31 10:18:34 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I though base platform could not get updates because of protected master profile
Jan 31 10:18:55 <mbooth>	The more I learn about p2, the less I know
Jan 31 10:19:59 <rgrunber>	for now updates can still be made.. it just installs them in the user's local area and adds them.
Jan 31 10:20:19 <mbooth>	I see

Feb 01 11:26:08 <nboldt>	mbooth: or Adventure
Feb 02 11:45:13 <rgrunber>	nboldt: just an fyi, was talking to Jeff (Maury) and mentioned that the last devstudio TP only had 2.1.0 fo Docker Tooling.. but looking at https://devstudio.jboss.com/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.product_master/latest/all/repo/ i do see 2.2.0.
Feb 02 11:45:53 <rgrunber>	was the last TP done prior to RC3 or something of Neon ?
Feb 02 11:45:58 <rgrunber>	*Neon.2
Feb 02 11:54:26 <nboldt>	rgrunber: not sure I understand. Jeff told you something that you figured out was wrong, so what's the problem?
Feb 02 11:55:23 <nboldt>	"last TP" == which version?
Feb 02 11:55:29 <rgrunber>	nboldt: ah.. he mentioned checking the TP for Neon.2 .. ? the one i pointed to is just the latest.
Feb 02 11:55:54 <nboldt>	too bad he's not on IRC or we could clarify this
Feb 02 11:56:07 <rgrunber>	hipchat, slack ?
Feb 02 11:56:11 *	nboldt wishes I didn't have to have the same conversation in IRC and Hipchat
Feb 02 11:56:40 <nboldt>	he's in slack? I'm not. never been invited. is it better or worse than irc/hc?
Feb 02 11:56:48 <rgrunber>	ah maybe he's looking at https://devstudio.jboss.com/10.0/snapshots/builds/devstudio.product_10.0.neon/latest/all/repo/
Feb 02 11:56:53 <nboldt>	maybe
Feb 02 11:56:58 <nboldt>	that's the last build for 10.2
Feb 02 11:57:03 <nboldt>	not hte last build for 10.3
Feb 02 11:57:16 <nboldt>	it'll be replaced with the latest 10.3 in 3 weeks 
Feb 02 11:57:41 <nboldt>	but since we have simplified processes to build from master for the AM* milestones, we don't overwrite that folder until GA
Feb 02 11:57:48 <rgrunber>	no idea on the hc/slack front.. i just use irc.
Feb 02 11:57:53 <nboldt>	+1 for simple
Feb 02 11:58:03 <nboldt>	only reason I use HC is for the snarky emojis
Feb 02 11:58:27 <nboldt>	and to talk to people who boycott IRC as "that thing grampas and opensource freetards use"
Feb 02 11:58:34 <nboldt>	:D
Feb 02 11:58:38 <rgrunber>	heh, so basically master is what 10.3 will be..
Feb 02 11:58:45 <nboldt>	#proudlyAFreetard
Feb 02 11:58:48 <nboldt>	yep
Feb 02 11:59:00 <rgrunber>	whoah.. someone's feeling libre today..
Feb 02 11:59:12 <nboldt>	if you saw the emails Mat & I sent on Friday, that's the latest stuff to use
Feb 02 11:59:25 <rgrunber>	k, i'll send him a message clarifying, sorry for the confusion.
Feb 02 11:59:29 <nboldt>	the AM2 bits are alive and well and living on a server near you
Feb 02 11:59:39 <nboldt>	no problem. wierd he wouldn't ask me directly
Feb 02 11:59:57 <nboldt>	I've got a few emails into him he's been ignoring. is he in Brno this week w/ the f2f folks?
Feb 02 12:00:24 <rgrunber>	fwiw i don't think he knew we were on the same team.. he asked me about the Docker Tooling stuff.. so i just pointed him to a bunch of the process, and added "also nbdolt is basically in our team meetings so he knwos directly"
Feb 02 12:00:56 <rgrunber>	this was all regarding whether Docker Tooling has an update they'd like to get into latest devstudio.
Feb 02 12:01:13 <nboldt>	ah
Feb 02 12:01:38 <nboldt>	well, the policy has always been "use the latest from Neon.whatever-is-released unless there's a reason to pull something newer"
Feb 02 12:01:55 <nboldt>	which is why the 10.3 TP is based on Neon.2 + latest WTP 3.8.2M
Feb 02 12:02:35 <nboldt>	so... we have 2 weeks to decide if we want a newer Docker Tooling feature/plugin set in JBT 4.4.3.Final / devstudio 10.3.0.GA
Feb 02 12:02:55 <nboldt>	after Feb 15, NONE SHALL PASS.
Feb 02 12:03:21 <nboldt>	Feb 15 I release the .Final version of the target platforms so we can update the jobs to use that instead of the SNAPSHOTs
Feb 02 12:03:37 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ^ feel free to cc: me on your reply to Jeff so I can throw in my $0.05 
Feb 02 12:03:47 <nboldt>	or just copy the above info for him :D
Feb 02 12:03:51 <rgrunber>	will do
Feb 02 12:05:11 <rgrunber>	so otherwise you're just taking Docker Tooling 2.2.0 (already in the master repo)
Feb 02 12:05:15 <rgrunber>	right ?
Feb 02 12:06:22 <nboldt>	yes, 2.2.0.201612072123 from https://devstudio.redhat.com/targetplatforms/jbdevstudiotarget/4.62.0.AM1-SNAPSHOT/REPO/features/
Feb 02 15:55:40 <scela>	rgrunber: hey
Feb 02 15:55:46 <rgrunber>	scela: hey
Feb 02 15:56:01 <scela>	rgrunber: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=511593
Feb 02 15:56:29 <scela>	rgrunber: see also the original bug from which it was cloned
Feb 02 15:56:53 <scela>	i think we saw something similar with split packages on another bug
Feb 02 15:57:11 <scela>	not sure if it's exactly same issue though
Feb 02 15:58:38 <scela>	mbooth: also FYI ^
Feb 02 16:00:06 <rgrunber>	so it's a subtle change in the dependencies that triggers a bug in the resolver..
Feb 02 16:00:20 <rgrunber>	felix.scr 2.0.8 just happened to be the unlucky bundle.
Feb 03 07:19:44 <akurtakov>	mistria: scela: can the generic editor use the file type icon when there is one ?
Feb 03 07:20:09 <akurtakov>	I mean when opening e.g. target file the editor to use that icon
Feb 03 07:42:23 <akurtakov>	mistria: would you please look at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1418963 ?
Feb 03 07:42:36 <akurtakov>	I guess you're the one that dealed with m2e most from the team
Feb 03 07:57:00 <scela>	akurtakov: you mean as the editor icon?
Feb 03 07:57:08 <scela>	it should be doing that at the moment
Feb 03 07:58:23 <akurtakov>	scela: yes, I open .target file 
Feb 03 07:58:43 <akurtakov>	and it uses the generic editor icon not the .target icon one sees in the explorer
Feb 03 07:59:09 <scela>	i believe the one you see in the explorer is the 'default' editor icon
Feb 03 07:59:26 <scela>	whereas the one editor of course shows the one you open it with
Feb 03 07:59:29 <scela>	akurtakov: ^
Feb 03 08:00:55 <akurtakov>	scela: hmm, I somehow thought we can have icon for file type not editor
Feb 03 08:00:58 <akurtakov>	am I wrong?
Feb 03 08:01:51 <akurtakov>	with more and more files moving to generic editor it becomes inconvenient
Feb 03 08:02:05 <scela>	let me check what the documentation says
Feb 03 08:02:25 <akurtakov>	scela: what if I want to move shell script editor to be generic editor? will the sh specific icon be no longer shown
Feb 03 08:03:52 <scela>	akurtakov: i'm not understanding your issue here
Feb 03 08:04:08 <scela>	do you have a problem with the targed definition file icon in the package explorer?
Feb 03 08:04:32 <akurtakov>	scela: no problem is in the editor area
Feb 03 08:04:46 <akurtakov>	think of java,python,c... being generic editors
Feb 03 08:05:01 <akurtakov>	that would mean the only icon one sees in editor area will be the generic one
Feb 03 08:05:05 <akurtakov>	not really helpful
Feb 03 08:05:08 <scela>	i think so yes
Feb 03 08:05:17 <scela>	if you open an html file with text editor
Feb 03 08:05:20 <scela>	you see text icon
Feb 03 08:05:30 <scela>	no?
Feb 03 08:05:45 <akurtakov>	scela: true
Feb 03 08:05:56 <akurtakov>	this doesn't mean we shouldn't try to make it better
Feb 03 08:06:08 <akurtakov>	if we have file type associated with icon
Feb 03 08:06:24 <akurtakov>	generic editor could adapt its icon to the file association
Feb 03 08:07:31 <scela>	akurtakov: can you file a bug for that?
Feb 03 08:07:45 <akurtakov>	scela: which component?
Feb 03 08:07:58 <scela>	akurtakov: platform.text
Feb 03 08:08:02 <scela>	that's where the core infra is
Feb 03 08:08:51 <akurtakov>	scela: incl. file types extension point ?
Feb 03 08:10:08 <scela>	akurtakov: do you envision this to be something only applicable to files opened with generic editor?
Feb 03 08:10:18 <scela>	akurtakov: or also plain text editor etc.
Feb 03 08:10:32 <akurtakov>	I don't see touching plain editor from our side
Feb 03 08:10:53 <scela>	akurtakov: infrastructure wise it might be a disruption as it would require to kill a one-editor one-icon concept
Feb 03 08:11:01 <akurtakov>	but as the mapping would have to be at filetype level if one wants to do it
Feb 03 08:11:02 <mistria>	akurtakov: it's supposed to use the Kerberos login, right?
Feb 03 08:11:04 <scela>	as the icon would be 'dynamic'
Feb 03 08:11:18 <akurtakov>	shouldn't be an issue
Feb 03 08:11:26 <akurtakov>	mistria: ??
Feb 03 08:11:36 <mistria>	akurtakov: red hat's bugzilla
Feb 03 08:11:45 <akurtakov>	mistria: ah, you don't have permissions?
Feb 03 08:12:12 <akurtakov>	scela: this concept is smth that will have to be changed yeah
Feb 03 08:16:16 <akurtakov>	mistria: do you have redhat bugzilla account?
Feb 03 08:16:21 <akurtakov>	if not you have to create one
Feb 03 08:16:26 <akurtakov>	please use your redhat email
Feb 03 08:16:41 <mistria>	akurtakov: ok, I thought I had one, but don't recall the password I used
Feb 03 08:16:45 <akurtakov>	after that I'll ask for your permissions to be raised
Feb 03 08:16:51 <mistria>	akurtakov: hence I tried Kerberos one, in vain
Feb 03 08:17:09 <akurtakov>	mistria: nope, it's separate one as it handles fedora devel too
Feb 03 08:17:18 <akurtakov>	mistria: reset your pass
Feb 03 08:27:06 <mistria>	akurtakov: I did login with my @redhat.com address and got
Feb 03 08:27:10 <mistria>	You are not authorized to access bug #1418963.
Feb 03 08:27:27 <akurtakov>	mistria: ok, I'll request pemissions for mistria@redhat.com
Feb 03 08:27:54 <mistria>	akurtakov: try also to add fbricon@redhat.com as well
Feb 03 08:28:13 <akurtakov>	do you know whether he has redhat bugzilla account ?
Feb 03 08:28:29 <akurtakov>	can't escalate on non-existing account
Feb 03 08:28:41 <akurtakov>	I'll do yours and we can handle it for fred once we are sure
Feb 03 08:28:52 <akurtakov>	also it would need manager approval and I don't know who is his
Feb 03 08:30:02 <mistria>	akurtakov: I don't know whether Fred has an account. IIRC, with the last refactoring, mbenitez is fbricon manager
Feb 03 08:30:38 <mbenitez>	yes I'm Fred's manager
Feb 03 08:33:15 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: ok, Martha, would please check with him and verify he has redhat bz account for m2e bug
Feb 03 08:33:25 <akurtakov>	and request devel permisions for him
Feb 03 08:33:30 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, please sen him an email and copy me
Feb 03 08:33:35 <mbenitez>	send
Feb 03 08:33:40 <mbenitez>	I'm in mtgs today
Feb 03 08:33:51 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: I have send request for Mickael already
Feb 03 08:33:56 <akurtakov>	you are on cc
Feb 03 08:34:22 <mbenitez>	good
Feb 03 08:36:54 <akurtakov>	mail to Fred/you sent too
Feb 03 08:37:05 <mbenitez>	thnx

Feb 07 09:52:36 <rgrunber>	hmm, yeah. fwiw , whatever you did to update the first time was still pretty darn close.
Feb 07 09:53:07 <rgrunber>	automated ?.. i mean do you take the latest ?.. or manually updated from when I/Jeff mentioned updating the stack ?
Feb 07 10:04:30 <nboldt>	yeah, I have a script that changes 0.0.0 or (the.old.version) to the latest
Feb 07 10:04:37 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ^
Feb 07 10:05:07 <nboldt>	rgrunber: devstudio TP looks like it's working. waiting on jbosstools to complete downloading
Feb 07 10:06:03 <rgrunber>	i seem to be getting a lot of late emails.. from @eclipse.org lists.
Feb 07 10:25:21 <scela>	rgrunber: for a moment i thought i read 'hate' emails
Feb 07 10:25:51 <scela>	rgrunber: my reflexes immediately blamed it on orbit for some reason :)
Feb 07 10:25:56 <rgrunber>	bahah
Feb 07 10:27:50 <rgrunber>	"Astronauts having to work out some quirks while in orbit on the ISS. Clearly Roland is at fault"
Feb 07 10:28:47 <rgrunber>	nah just really late emails, particularly from bugzilla/gerrit.
Feb 07 10:29:24 <scela>	rgrunber: yeah i see. it seems fine over here.
Feb 07 10:45:34 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ok, crisis averted. TP is building in Jenkins now. Have a number of dupe IUs that I can try to reduce (we had 8 of them in 4.6.2 TP and now it's 11) but that's not a blocker
Feb 07 10:46:16 <rgrunber>	nboldt: k woohoo :)
Feb 07 10:47:04 <rgrunber>	nboldt: btw if you run into any issues using httpclient 4.5.2.. ie.. if something can't find fluent.hc or httpclient.cache, or http.entity.mime.. just use 4.3.6 for now.. 4.5.2 will be fixed in M6.
Feb 07 10:48:37 <nboldt>	so far so good but thx for the tip
Feb 07 11:47:16 <akurtakov>	mbooth: hey Mat
Feb 07 11:47:25 <akurtakov>	you had some fedora infrastructure
Feb 07 11:47:25 <mbooth>	Hi
Feb 07 11:47:33 <akurtakov>	hudson running, right?
Feb 07 11:48:08 <mbooth>	akurtakov: https://jenkins.fedorainfracloud.org/
Feb 07 11:48:16 <mbooth>	This one?
Feb 07 11:48:37 <akurtakov>	mbooth: probably
Feb 07 11:48:50 <akurtakov>	do you whether one can get ppc builders there?
Feb 07 11:49:19 <akurtakov>	hmm, I can't login
Feb 07 11:49:29 <akurtakov>	Failed to discover OpenID: http://id.fedoraproject.org/
Feb 07 11:50:25 <akurtakov>	mbooth: ^
Feb 07 11:51:15 <rgrunber>	ditto... a stacktrace as well
Feb 07 11:51:21 <mbooth>	Uh, probably not TBH. COPR can build ppc64le these days, if that is helpful?
Feb 07 11:52:02 <akurtakov>	mbooth: who would be the best contact for such questions?
Feb 07 11:52:52 <mbooth>	mizdebsk is probably the person to ping about https://jenkins.fedorainfracloud.org/
Feb 07 11:53:36 <akurtakov>	mbooth: ah, so it's not infra managed?
Feb 07 11:53:57 <akurtakov>	anyway, this makes it easier, thanks
Feb 07 11:54:00 <mbooth>	No, *.fedorainfracloud.org is contributor managed
Feb 07 12:45:43 <akurtakov>	ipun: here?
Feb 08 09:06:47 <scela>	akurtakov: lufimtse any idea what might be causing https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=511732
Feb 08 09:07:14 <scela>	there might be a relation to gtk3, though the investigation is inconclusive
Feb 08 09:11:25 <akurtakov>	scela: no idea, I haven't experienced it
Feb 08 09:12:18 <scela>	akurtakov: yeah there is not much information on what is going on
Feb 08 09:12:43 <scela>	akurtakov: gtk3 is suspect just because it doesn't happen with gtk2, not because of some technical reason
Feb 08 09:17:53 <akurtakov>	I have eclipse running for 27h and it's at 1.6G
Feb 08 09:18:24 <mbooth>	FWIW, looks like user has Fedora 23 == old gtk3
Feb 08 09:30:19 <scela>	mbooth: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=511732#c12 is the result of his rpm -q
Feb 08 09:33:51 <mbooth>	scela: Yes, IMO he should try to reproduce on a not-end-of-life platform
Feb 08 09:34:04 <akurtakov>	mbooth: I already asked for that :)
Feb 08 09:34:31 <mbooth>	:-)
Feb 08 09:34:34 <scela>	akurtakov: what's our min gtk3 supported version again? i always mix them up
Feb 08 09:34:44 <akurtakov>	2.24 :)
Feb 08 09:34:53 <akurtakov>	we never set a min gtk3 version
Feb 08 09:34:59 <scela>	yeah ok
Feb 08 09:35:01 <akurtakov>	aka everything above 2.24 is fine
Feb 08 09:36:06 <akurtakov>	I really hope that next rhel7.x will have gtk 3.22 and I can just say - nothing else matters :)
Feb 08 09:37:21 <akurtakov>	now I have to deal with ppc builds so oxygen has both gtk2 and gtk3
Feb 08 09:37:32 <akurtakov>	so hopefully bump the min version next year again
Feb 08 09:38:18 <scela>	so if it doesn't happen on F25 with gtk3.18 but it does happen on F23 with gtk 3.18, does this mean it's not a gtk issue?
Feb 08 09:38:45 <akurtakov>	scela: f25 has 3.22
Feb 08 09:39:05 <akurtakov>	and it it doesn't happen on f25 it's smth fixed in the gtk stack
Feb 08 09:39:20 <scela>	but since we're supporting also 3.18, what happens then?
Feb 08 09:40:08 <akurtakov>	scela: nothing, f23 is no-longer supported fedora version and it doesnt mean same happens on other distros that ship with 3.18
Feb 08 09:40:15 <akurtakov>	they might have patched things and etc.
Feb 08 09:42:08 <akurtakov>	scela: of course if some way to reproduce is pointed out and it leads to leak caused by swt we will work on it
Feb 08 09:42:20 <akurtakov>	but with so vague info nothing we can do
Feb 08 09:42:33 <scela>	akurtakov: i see
Feb 08 09:43:11 <scela>	akurtakov: i'm trying to understand better or workflow in these cases as everytime i think i understand it something happens which is different from what I thought :)
Feb 08 10:36:26 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Nice, I didn't connect the problem to that patch
Feb 08 10:36:48 <rgrunber>	:( it's the patch.
Feb 08 10:51:19 <lufimtse>	scela, hey ya, I replied to the bug.
Feb 08 10:52:55 <scela>	lufimtse: ok thanks
Feb 09 09:40:00 <nboldt1>	mbooth: hey, do you think you'll be able to move RHSCL 2.4 from Neon.2 to Neon.3 before April 26 ?
Feb 09 09:40:04 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: ^
Feb 09 09:40:33 <mbooth>	It is not planned, AFAIK
Feb 09 09:42:23 <mbenitez>	mbooth, correct, it's not planned, but seems we'll need to do this for devtools
Feb 09 09:42:47 <mbenitez>	right now we'll miss one release since SCL Alpha bits can't be used by customers
Feb 09 09:43:21 <mbenitez>	so we'll need to align with the next train, where devstudio will be on neon.3
Feb 09 09:43:29 <mbenitez>	we need to talk this with vkadlcik_gone too
Feb 09 09:53:21 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: "[9:40 AM] Nick Boldt: @MarthaBenitez when are RHSCL 2.4 Beta code freeze and release dates?
Feb 09 09:53:21 <nboldt1>	[9:41 AM] Martha Benitez: next week which of course doesn't work
Feb 09 09:53:21 <nboldt1>	[9:41 AM] Martha Benitez: Beta release is April 5"
Feb 09 09:53:31 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: [9:50 AM] Nick Boldt: wait, the code freeze is mid Feb but the release is 6 weeks later?
Feb 09 09:53:31 <nboldt1>	[9:50 AM] Nick Boldt: it takes 6 weeks to test a Beta? 
Feb 09 09:54:25 <mbenitez>	QE only gets 2 of those weeks
Feb 09 09:54:29 <nboldt1>	if that's the case we won't be able to absorb Neon.3 since it's not even available until March 23
Feb 09 09:54:42 <nboldt1>	oh, so we can "code freeze" but keep making changes?
Feb 09 09:55:29 <nboldt1>	there's 2 weeks between Mar 23 and Apr 5
Feb 09 09:55:47 <nboldt1>	... so this could work. In theory
Feb 09 09:57:07 <mbenitez>	we shouldn't but let's see if we can
Feb 09 10:13:16 <nboldt1>	something something REQUIRED something something product alignment something something
Feb 09 11:43:59 <mistria>	akurtakov: latest snapshot has completion for VSCode CSS

Feb 14 08:17:37 <akurtakov>	mbooth: fails with https://paste.fedoraproject.org/557981/14870782/ for me
Feb 14 08:25:49 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Hmm, it WFM
Feb 14 08:25:55 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Any broken symlinks?
Feb 14 08:25:57 <mbooth>	for l in $(find  /usr/lib64/eclipse/plugins -type l) ; do if [ ! -e $l ] ; then ls -l $l ; fi ; done
Feb 14 08:27:00 <akurtakov>	nothing
Feb 14 08:27:26 <akurtakov>	mbooth: I'm fully uptodate with updates-testing enabled
Feb 14 08:27:34 <akurtakov>	if this makes a difference :)
Feb 14 08:27:58 <mbooth>	Ah, okay I only get updates-testing for packages named "eclipse-*"
Feb 14 08:28:04 <mbooth>	Let me see
Feb 14 08:28:33 *	akurtakov would suspect jetty update :)
Feb 14 08:30:53 <mbooth>	What jetty version-release do you have installed?
Feb 14 08:32:25 <mbooth>	On F25 I have 9.4.0-0.2.M0
Feb 14 08:33:12 <mbooth>	I don't see a newer build
Feb 14 09:56:39 <nboldt>	mbooth: there's a full 9.4.0 out... even a 9.4.1 out. https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.html 
Feb 14 09:57:09 <nboldt>	I've moved the Oxygen-based TP for devstudio 11 (coming next week after we branch) to use Jetty 9.4.0, iirc
Feb 14 09:57:16 <nboldt>	but still on 9.3.something for Neon.2
Feb 14 09:57:25 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yep, it is built for F26: https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=4951
Feb 14 09:57:45 <nboldt>	but not backported for F25? that could be a problem in a month's time
Feb 14 09:58:27 *	nboldt wonders if somewhere Pascal is cringing that the Jetty download page refers to P2 and not p2 :D
Feb 14 10:00:04 <nboldt>	mbooth: re: the m2e problems you say are fixed... how can I verify? just pull latest from Brew and install to see what explodes?
Feb 14 10:00:36 <nboldt>	eg., from http://download-node-02.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/latest-RHSCL-2-RHEL-7/compose/Server/x86_64/os/ ?
Feb 14 10:00:46 <nboldt>	or from http://download-node-02.eng.bos.redhat.com/brewroot/repos/rhscl-2.4-rh-eclipse46-rhel-7-build/latest/x86_64/ ?
Feb 14 10:30:32 <mbooth>	nboldt: Erm, the second one
Feb 14 10:31:00 <mbooth>	The first link will still be the alpha bits
Feb 14 10:42:50 <nboldt>	ok, thanks
Feb 14 11:04:06 <rgrunber>	nboldt: thanks for the suggestion.. i'll have to look. it's a hudson instance.. no idea if that jenkins plugin would work or exists for hudson.
Feb 14 11:19:28 <nboldt>	rgrunber: something something wtf is Eclipse still using Hudson something something 2017 already something something rabble rabble
Feb 14 11:20:33 <mbooth>	rgrunber, nboldt: FWIW, I think infra will provision a jenkins (e.g. ECF project's HIPP is a JIPP)
Feb 14 11:20:57 <rgrunber>	nboldt: everywhere internally i hear jenkins jenkins.. and to the extent that it's preferred by developer program teams.. how has this not bubbled into Eclipse through various committees :P
Feb 14 11:21:37 <nboldt>	rgrunber: is this something that the planning council should address? we have SOME clout I guess
Feb 14 11:24:30 <rgrunber>	hmm https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=487087
Feb 14 11:25:17 <rgrunber>	https://hudson.eclipse.org/ecf/ cool
Feb 14 11:26:25 <nboldt>	so JIPPs are coming. woo
Feb 14 11:42:32 <ipun>	rgrunber: could you send me the link to the presentation about Wayland again? I forgot to bookmark it
Feb 14 11:43:59 <rgrunber>	sure.
Feb 14 11:44:16 <rgrunber>	ipun: https://archive.fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/enlightenment_of_wayland/
Feb 14 11:44:30 <ipun>	ah yes thank you 
Feb 14 11:51:04 <nboldt>	mbooth: hey, when stuff is built in an rpm it gets a new timestamp, even if the sources are the same as code from 3 months ago, right?
Feb 14 11:51:33 <nboldt>	eg., org.eclipse.jst.server_core.feature_3.4.300.v201701271400 vs. org.eclipse.jst.server_core.feature_3.4.300.v201606081655 ?
Feb 14 11:52:17 <nboldt>	first is from the webtools-servertools droplet, the second is from Neon.2 update site
Feb 14 11:52:30 <mbooth>	Yeah, this is a tycho/git deficiency, i.e. reproducible timestamps are only possible when building from a git repo
Feb 14 11:52:50 <nboldt>	mbooth: but... aren't you building from git.eclipse.org? 
Feb 14 11:53:06 <nboldt>	can't you use the jgit timestamp provider?
Feb 14 11:53:21 <mbooth>	No, builds cannot access the internet, so we have to build from tarball
Feb 14 11:53:25 <nboldt>	instead of the default one that uses ${now} as the timestamp?
Feb 14 11:53:33 <nboldt>	ugh
Feb 14 11:53:39 *	nboldt shakes a fist at brew
Feb 14 11:54:01 <nboldt>	ok, well that explains the errors that lvalach has been seeing
Feb 14 11:56:47 <mbooth>	nboldt: Additionally: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=405042
Feb 14 11:57:15 <mbooth>	It was easier to just disable jgit timestamp provider than maintain our own version
Feb 14 11:57:26 <mbooth>	That could deal with being "offline"
Feb 14 11:58:19 <nboldt>	sure, but the result is we get shittons of singleton warnings in Eclipse if you install something into Eclipse from an update site that's already installed via rpm dep in a droplet folder. https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4270
Feb 14 12:00:23 <mbooth>	Well, I'm not convinced that newer timestamps causes that -- it should be resolving deps from the installed bundles, instead of re-downloading them, no?
Feb 14 12:00:51 <nboldt>	yeah, it SHOULD be saying "this is already installed, nothing to do."
Feb 14 12:01:14 <nboldt>	but droplets != p2 installations, so maybe something isn't being registered correctly. question for rgrunber perhaps?
Feb 14 12:02:14 <nboldt>	in this specific case, the user shouldn't be trying to install stuff from Central that's already installed, and even if they do it's just console log clutter, not real problem. but even so, it shows a problem, albeit a nitpicky one, not a functional one
Feb 14 12:10:16 <rgrunber>	nboldt: my fix to the .feature.groups on Fedora side might resolve this particular issue (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4270)
Feb 14 12:10:20 <rgrunber>	i could look at it.
Feb 14 12:12:25 <rgrunber>	oh yeah.. if you're seeing feature.groups as installable .. despite existing locally, that should be fixed.. of course they'd probably register as updates if the timestamps of the p2 content is newer..
Feb 14 12:13:32 <nboldt>	sure, but in the case of the JST server stuff, the timestamp of the feature / feature.group is 2016 and the already-installed stuff from webtools rpm is 2017
Feb 14 12:14:02 <nboldt>	so it SHOULD not be offering the old stuff as an installable option on top of the newer stuff. it SHOULD be saying "you already have 2017 version, nothing to install here"
Feb 14 12:14:07 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ^
Feb 14 12:14:50 <nboldt>	similar issue in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-4268 ... I can install 201701 features on top of already installed 201702 features. 
Feb 14 12:15:01 <nboldt>	and I get some funky errors in the console: https://issues.jboss.org/secure/attachment/12416531/12416531_rh-eclipse46-devstudio10.3-0.20170214.1451.el7.log.20170214-1203_strict.txt
Feb 14 12:15:27 <nboldt>	ever seen "Found components with duplicated names!" errors before? That's new to me
Feb 14 12:16:06 <mbooth>	ahh, rgrunber should this be ported to RHSCL? http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/eclipse.git/commit/?id=7de04d1d88f270565613c6f93ec8fe9a178516fa
Feb 14 12:16:27 <rgrunber>	yes i was just looking at what is rh-ecipse46 on vs say f25 eclipse..
Feb 14 12:16:37 <mbooth>	Eclipse in RHSCL is equivilent to only -4 IIRC
Feb 14 12:17:23 <rgrunber>	Yeah 'Fix bug in p2 Droplet detection of feature groups.' should be backported.. or updated to at least depending on what path is taken.
Feb 14 12:19:28 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Cool, I like it when problems are already fixed :-)
Feb 14 12:19:33 <rgrunber>	nboldt: the reason even an older version is installed is because the feature.group is not detected as installed. that patch fixes things.
Feb 14 12:19:53 <nboldt>	+1, I like this patch. can we get it into rh-eclipse46-* ?
Feb 14 12:20:24 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yes, should be no problem
Feb 14 12:30:31 <rgrunber>	thanks :)
Feb 15 09:43:00 <rgrunber>	are the HIPPs slow to respond for anyone else.. i can load the main page.. but not a project-specific one.
Feb 15 10:04:36 <scela>	rgrunber: they're pretty fast for me
Feb 15 10:04:55 <rgrunber>	scela: specifically, anything residing on hipp3
Feb 15 10:05:02 <rgrunber>	the other ones seem to be ok.
Feb 15 10:10:08 <scela>	rgrunber: it's dead https://dev.eclipse.org/committers/help/status.php
Feb 15 10:10:31 <rgrunber>	scela++ thanks for the link!
Feb 15 10:10:40 <scela>	rgrunber: np
Feb 15 10:10:49 <scela>	rgrunber: quite handy place to check for infra status
Feb 15 10:11:02 <rgrunber>	scela: is that page reachable from any known page (ie. committer portal) ?
Feb 15 10:11:10 <scela>	yes
Feb 15 10:11:27 <scela>	right, center - committer tools group
Feb 15 10:11:38 <scela>	'Eclipse infra status' link
Feb 15 10:11:40 <rgrunber>	ah yeah
Feb 15 10:11:44 <rgrunber>	just found it.. niice
Feb 15 10:13:37 <scela>	i'll also respond to your cross project email
Feb 15 10:19:11 <rgrunber>	eek seems slightly serious.. ?
Feb 15 10:20:58 <scela>	rgrunber: the email you mean? 
Feb 15 10:21:13 <rgrunber>	yeah.. 
Feb 15 10:21:15 <scela>	haha yeah the wording for such a short email is not ideal :)
Feb 15 10:23:54 <rgrunber>	kind of interesting that it died at midnight after hitting peak load.. some job killed it ?
Feb 15 10:24:13 <mbenitez>	scela, good to see you back, hope you're feeling much better
Feb 15 10:24:37 <scela>	rgrunber: yeah no idea what caused to crash
Feb 15 10:24:49 <scela>	mbenitez: thanks, yeah I'm feeling a bit better, enough to do some work
Feb 15 10:25:58 <rgrunber>	scela: ah sorry, to hear you weren't feeling well. Also something from fosdem ?
Feb 15 10:26:08 <jjohnstn|wfh>	rgrunber: I put down we had no pending CQs for 5.3.0...I assume that all docker-client stuff is already approved...if not, let me know and I'll update the IP team
Feb 15 10:26:52 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn|wfh: i believe we have one.. on libffi.. Sharon wanted to reach out to some people about licensing of some files.. i haven't heard back..
Feb 15 10:27:32 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn|wfh: https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12043
Feb 15 10:28:27 <scela>	rgrunber: no got a cold during the weekend. it was awfully cold here with snow and very low temps and I had two nights out with friends on Fri and Sat
Feb 15 10:29:09 <scela>	for which I 'paid' on Sun-Tue :)
Feb 15 11:03:44 <jjohnstn|wfh>	rgrunber: libffi is not in our plugins for the build and there only seems to be a libjffi in jffi native...should it be listed in our category.xml? 
Feb 15 11:04:33 <rgrunber>	scela: jjohnstn|wfh , no we don't ship it.. but its headers and some object files are used to build jffi native components.
Feb 15 11:06:21 <jjohnstn|wfh>	ok, thx for the clarification
Feb 15 11:50:35 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, thanks for the info! I'll relay it to Nathan
Feb 15 11:53:47 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: yeah, there might be something i'm missing.. but if the goal is to build multiple source folders, with maven, and package artifacts into various subpackages all having different version.. that all seems possible. Mat might hav emore detailed knowledge about a particular difficulty.
Feb 15 11:55:42 <mbenitez>	great, we'll give it a try and follow up
Feb 15 12:24:36 <mbooth>	mbenitez: rgrunber: I sent some examples that might be instructive 
Feb 15 12:31:32 <mbenitez>	mbooth, thanks a lot!
Feb 15 13:11:35 *	You are now known as lufimtse|lunch
Feb 15 13:20:16 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn|wfh: Sharon just approved libffi.
Feb 15 13:21:15 <jjohnstn|wfh>	rgrunber: thx ... I sent Sharon a note and she said she was going to handle it today
Feb 15 14:38:25 *	You are now known as lufimtse

Feb 16 11:26:40 <rgrunber>	TIL using the entire fedora eclipse + plugins as a target platform is bound to fail eventually..
Feb 16 11:27:04 <mbooth>	How did it fail?
Feb 16 11:27:54 <rgrunber>	it wouldn't run the test cases.. child eclipse came up, and just hung there.
Feb 16 11:28:49 <rgrunber>	i was trying to run a p2 test bundle but my target platform consisted of every eclipse plugin rpm + /usr/share/java for good measure (eg. easymock and some others not linked)..
Feb 16 11:29:12 <mbooth>	ETOOMUCHJUNKINSTALLED
Feb 16 11:29:15 <rgrunber>	finally bothered to create a proper .target file for neon based off of mars.. it works.
Feb 16 11:29:28 <rgrunber>	now i have another file worth committing to p2.
Feb 17 09:13:27 <nboldt>	mbooth: current status: waiting for https://jenkins.hosts.mwqe.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/jbosstools-openshift_4.4.neon/buildTimeTrend to finish, then kicking the downstream jobs. ETA 1-2hrs before we can push to staging
Feb 17 09:14:47 <mbooth>	nboldt: Cool, I didn't want to start anything with resolution of 'critical' bug still unknown
Feb 17 09:15:17 <nboldt>	mbooth: yeah, I think we're good now (or will be in a couple hours)
Feb 17 09:27:20 <nboldt>	mbooth: ok, all jobs downstream from the openshift crit fix are running: https://jenkins.hosts.mwqe.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/DevStudio/view/devstudio_10.0.neon/
Feb 17 09:39:21 <mbooth>	Woo, even some red builds turned blue
Feb 17 11:30:45 <nboldt>	mbooth: yes, but https://jenkins.hosts.mwqe.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/DevStudio/view/devstudio_10.0.neon/job/jbosstools-build-sites.aggregate.child-sites_4.4.neon/ is still red... realized it was an rsync publishing timeout... so I've given it more time and kicked it again
Feb 17 11:32:14 <nboldt>	waiting on 2 jobs to finish now https://jenkins.hosts.mwqe.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/DevStudio/view/devstudio_10.0.neon/
Feb 17 11:32:27 <nboldt>	child sites (central) and devstudio product
Feb 17 11:35:36 <nboldt>	and just figured out why it's timing out... hardcoded IP address in the publishing mojo :(
Feb 17 11:38:00 <mbooth>	Doh
Feb 17 11:43:26 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Is oprofile policy uneeded in Fedora these days then?
Feb 17 11:43:43 <mbooth>	(Can I get rid of it in the packaging?)
Feb 17 11:44:07 <rgrunber>	looking at the bug it would even seem like opcontrol is gone from later versions.. ie getting rid of corresponding .java files is definitely doable..
Feb 17 11:45:24 <rgrunber>	mbooth: yeah i don't even see opcontrol in oprofile from 24.
Feb 17 11:46:55 <rgrunber>	and if it's disabled unused in dts/rhscl as Alex mentioned..
Feb 17 11:47:01 <rgrunber>	Alex is gonna be happy.
Feb 17 11:59:20 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Damn, there is still opcontrol in base rhel 7
Feb 17 11:59:58 <rgrunber>	but do we support it.. could have sworn Alex told me we don't and that was the motivation for starting a discussion upstream about dropping it..
Feb 17 12:03:07 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i'll have to confirm with Alex because you're right.. i still see it in the linuxtools rpm.
Feb 17 12:04:49 <nboldt>	mbooth: I'm going to have to update the jobs to use the new IP address... I think you're off the hook for doing the staging today
Feb 17 12:05:19 <nboldt>	since it's Friday 5pm UK time... and doing complicated stuff at the end of the week is highly NOT recommended. :( 
Feb 17 12:05:52 <mbooth>	nboldt: Okay, well, I submitted the doc updates I had ready: https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-devdoc/pull/141 
Feb 17 12:08:57 <nboldt>	mbooth: thanks. welcome to "last minute respin requests" ... when everything can and does take longer than you'd like
Feb 17 12:15:11 <nboldt>	mbooth: thanks, merged
Feb 17 12:20:10 <mbooth>	nboldt: I will just have to get my fill of this on Wednesday :-)
Feb 17 12:20:25 <nboldt>	mbooth: yeah, unless you REALLY want to stay late tonight?
Feb 17 12:20:37 *	nboldt is pushing updated job configs to server
Feb 17 12:20:52 <nboldt>	*cough* What could possibly go wrong next? */cough*
Feb 17 12:27:18 <mbooth>	nboldt: Heh, "Hold my beer while I edit this crucial bit of config..."
Feb 17 12:28:15 <nboldt>	mbooth: yeah, exactly. Talk to you next week, then :D
Feb 17 12:28:32 *	nboldt mumbles something about going off to test something in production
Feb 17 13:36:50 *	scox is away: dentist
Feb 17 14:59:00 *	scox is back (gone 01:22:10)

Mar 06 09:47:13 <mistria>	akurtakov: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=513159 . Do you think it's work working on it with highest priority?
Mar 06 09:47:36 <akurtakov>	mistria: no
Mar 06 09:47:51 <akurtakov>	we are past api freeze so no chance for that one
Mar 06 09:48:07 <akurtakov>	but we should work on these items as part of Photon M1-2
Mar 06 09:48:19 <akurtakov>	with the possibility to backport
Mar 06 09:48:43 <mistria>	akurtakov: Platform is 25% of its time API Frozen, 15% Feature frozen, 10% UI Frozen...
Mar 06 09:48:55 <mistria>	akurtakov: as if we add too much time anyway ;)
Mar 06 09:49:18 <mistria>	akurtakov: could be only a content-type field added to extension point
Mar 06 09:49:44 <akurtakov>	if you think it would be small change I'll bring it for exception to PMC
Mar 06 09:49:56 <akurtakov>	but it has to be ready in the next 4 weeks
Mar 06 09:50:22 <akurtakov>	mistria: in theory even the content-type icon would be smth similar
Mar 06 09:50:59 <mistria>	akurtakov: I think it's doable and not a big change, I'm just wondering about whether it's worth it and more important than some other bugs
Mar 06 09:51:21 <akurtakov>	mistria: what is the other thing you evaluate ?
Mar 06 09:51:53 <akurtakov>	if we can get internal changes/bug fixes that follow the rules I would prefer them
Mar 06 09:52:09 <akurtakov>	aka don't lose bullets :)
Mar 06 09:52:39 <mistria>	akurtakov: I don't have an idea of another issue in particular, there are the extensions for generic editors that would be worth being implemented, but as it's already API freeze...
Mar 06 09:53:22 <akurtakov>	what about lsp4e? is there pending work there?
Mar 06 09:53:41 <akurtakov>	I mean such that we need for oxygen
Mar 06 09:54:53 <akurtakov>	mistria: btw, we are lacking documentation/howtos/blogs for the generic editors badly
Mar 06 09:55:09 <mistria>	akurtakov: there are a few bugs https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?classification=Technology&list_id=15943450&product=lsp4e&query_format=advanced&resolution=--- , but nothing blocking us from using it already; I see no high priority there
Mar 06 09:55:24 <akurtakov>	I would like to see some buzz about it created to get the message out for people starting new editors
Mar 06 09:56:00 <mistria>	akurtakov: ok
Mar 06 09:57:15 <mistria>	scela: What's the state of PDE templates for Generic Editor? IIRC, there is a bug about it, isn't it?
Mar 06 10:02:22 <mistria>	akurtakov: I see you're using a gmail address at eclipse.org
Mar 06 10:02:29 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: weekly status reports due by the team call in 1hr
Mar 06 10:02:40 <akurtakov>	mistria: yeah, history :0
Mar 06 10:03:20 <mistria>	akurtakov: I think it makes that your contributions on bugzilla don't count as red hat ones
Mar 06 10:03:38 <akurtakov>	mistria: not true
Mar 06 10:03:43 <mistria>	akurtakov: ah?
Mar 06 10:03:53 <akurtakov>	I commit from akurtako@redhat.com
Mar 06 10:04:17 <akurtakov>	but use my gmail for bz only in order to be able to reply from the phone where I don't want my redhat mails :)
Mar 06 10:05:01 <akurtakov>	best mix I found for myself :)
Mar 06 10:05:14 <mistria>	akurtakov: IIRC, dashboard also aggregates contribution by BZ or ML http://dashboard.eclipse.org/
Mar 06 10:05:29 <mistria>	akurtakov: anyway, it's not a big deal
Mar 06 10:05:41 <akurtakov>	well, my bz is not counted in this case :)
Mar 06 10:05:59 <akurtakov>	but "show me the code" :)
Mar 06 10:08:05 <mistria>	scela: ok, found it again https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=502258
Mar 06 10:31:20 <mistria>	akurtakov scela: could you review https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/91630/ ?
Mar 06 10:52:46 <akurtakov>	mistria: where do these commands popup ?
Mar 06 10:53:15 <mistria>	akurtakov: they're usually toggle item in the toolbar, bound as actionSets
Mar 06 10:56:00 <akurtakov>	mistria: for some reason I see them without your patch too

Mar 08 08:17:02 <mistria>	maxandersen: hi
Mar 08 08:17:10 <mistria>	maxandersen: about the PDE in Java package story
Mar 08 08:18:04 <mistria>	maxandersen: Does the project you're trying to open already have a .project; or it it a Maven project; or are you trying to create a new one...?
Mar 08 09:30:57 <mbenitez>	mistria, hi, did you hear anything wrt EclipseCon FR sponsorship?
Mar 08 09:31:07 <mistria>	mbenitez: nope
Mar 08 09:32:31 <mbenitez>	hmm ok
Mar 08 09:32:45 <mbenitez>	mistria, that was a couple of weeks ago already?
Mar 08 09:32:54 <mistria>	mbenitez: yes, I think so
Mar 08 09:33:01 <mistria>	mbenitez: let me check the exact date
Mar 08 09:33:22 <mbenitez>	mistria, may be good to re-ping, please CC me
Mar 08 09:34:49 <mistria>	mbenitez: I asked Gael (from Eclipse Fdn) to directly send prospectus to Jessica, but don't know if he did it
Mar 08 09:36:33 <mistria>	akuratakov: I asked OmniSharp developers on their slack, and all there software seems to be MIT
Mar 08 09:38:07 <mbenitez>	mistria, that's a good idea, then they can follow up
Mar 08 09:38:20 <mbenitez>	if you need my help just let me know
Mar 08 09:40:01 <mistria>	mbenitez: I told Gael to not expect too much, from Red Hat and even from me. Getting sponsoring is a too long and annoying task for me. I tried it a few time, I could have re-coded Eclispe fully twice in the time it took to get some answers
Mar 08 09:58:04 <patrickm>	ipun: are you giving a dry run of your presentation at the office?
Mar 08 09:58:24 <mbenitez>	that'd be nice
Mar 08 09:59:51 <akurtakov>	mistria: do they have it written somewhere that it's MIT ?
Mar 08 10:02:08 <ipun>	patrickm: would you like me to??
Mar 08 10:03:05 <ipun>	might as well pull rgrunber in while at it :)
Mar 08 10:03:19 <patrickm>	ipun: it could be beneficial for both you [work out the kinks] and the office
Mar 08 10:03:31 <mbenitez>	ipun, nicely played :P
Mar 08 10:03:43 <mbenitez>	we could have an eclipseCon day
Mar 08 10:08:10 <ipun>	Sure we could set that up. I should have most of it ready by tuesday 
Mar 08 10:10:21 <mbenitez>	sold! ipun please consider it done, let's see what time patrickm suggests
Mar 08 10:11:26 <patrickm>	mbenitez, ipun: i'm good anytime
Mar 08 10:12:47 <ipun>	i think sometime after lunch would be good, but since its eclipsecon DAY, we should see when rgrunber is ready as well :D
Mar 08 10:13:12 <ipun>	trust me, you'll learn tons about docker tooling from him
Mar 08 10:13:56 <mbenitez>	there he is
Mar 08 10:14:15 <rgrunber>	problem ?
Mar 08 10:14:37 <mbenitez>	ipun, if it's Tuesday I think it'd have to be around noon
Mar 08 10:14:59 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, no, ipun just volunteered you for an eclipseCon day next week
Mar 08 10:15:34 <ipun>	:P
Mar 08 10:15:45 <rgrunber>	ipun: details..
Mar 08 10:15:57 <ipun>	rgrunber: when do you think you'll be ready?
Mar 08 10:16:21 <ipun>	rgrunber: we're doing a dry run at the office
Mar 08 10:16:47 <rgrunber>	ah ok.. yeah next week sounds good for starting dry runs.
Mar 08 10:16:53 <mbenitez>	ipun, fyi Thursday is another option
Mar 08 10:17:22 <ipun>	mbenitez: i'm actually leaving on thursday morning to go early
Mar 08 10:17:29 <ipun>	best would be either tuesday or wednesday
Mar 08 10:17:48 <rgrunber>	either are fine with me.
Mar 08 10:19:00 <mbenitez>	ipun, then Tuesday
Mar 08 10:20:02 <ipun>	great 
Mar 08 10:20:07 <rgrunber>	ok phew.. i though Ian volunteered me for some kind of booth duty / display case stuff...
Mar 08 10:21:17 <mbenitez>	rgrunber, not yet... ;)
Mar 08 10:21:22 <rgrunber>	VETO
Mar 08 10:22:11 <mbenitez>	haha fair enough
Mar 08 10:40:46 <mbenitez>	mbooth, hi, if you're around, do you have a few minutes to jump on a devstudio call?
Mar 08 10:41:03 <mbenitez>	https://bluejeans.com/6504809063/
Mar 08 10:43:46 <mbooth>	mbenitez: sure one sec

Mar 09 09:21:52 <mbooth>	scela: Hi
Mar 09 09:22:23 <scela>	mbooth: so i patched mylyn lucene migration patch for 6.1 and i think i'm ready to try it out
Mar 09 09:22:38 <scela>	mbooth: how do you usually test if the patch is good?
Mar 09 09:22:53 <scela>	mbooth: in other words how do you trigger the indexing and also querying
Mar 09 09:24:16 <akurtakov>	scela: using Task List search 
Mar 09 09:24:38 <scela>	akurtakov: can you be a bit more specific. mylyn is not something i use at all.
Mar 09 09:24:53 <akurtakov>	scela: open Task List view
Mar 09 09:25:14 <scela>	done
Mar 09 09:25:21 <akurtakov>	type in the search
Mar 09 09:25:41 <scela>	ok but it's empty
Mar 09 09:26:14 <mbooth>	scela: I suppose you need to right click in the view to add a query first
Mar 09 09:26:26 <mbooth>	To fetch bugs from remote bug tracker
Mar 09 09:26:33 <mbooth>	Then search
Mar 09 09:26:45 <scela>	ok
Mar 09 09:26:58 <akurtakov>	scela: or just ue the new icon to create few local tasks you can search
Mar 09 09:32:18 <scela>	ok it seems it's going
Mar 09 09:32:21 <scela>	akurtakov: mbooth thanks
Mar 13 09:26:25 <mbenitez>	mbooth, just got a shout out from devstudio QE about your help / ownership of the release, good job!
Mar 13 09:26:57 <mbooth>	Ah, thanks
Mar 13 10:29:49 <rgrunber>	nboldt: happening in 2 days, you didn't miss it.
Mar 13 10:29:54 <rgrunber>	(ie wednesday)
Mar 13 10:29:57 <nboldt>	rgrunber: thanks
Mar 13 10:30:02 <scela>	mbenitez: today's meeting is in 0:30 right?
Mar 13 10:30:12 <nboldt>	we'll see how my week's going and might mosey in 
Mar 13 10:30:46 <mbenitez>	scela, yes
Mar 13 10:30:57 <mbenitez>	thanks for the reminder!
Mar 13 10:31:14 <nboldt>	mbenitez: scela: ah, the joys of pointless timezone shifts
Mar 13 10:31:35 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: weeklu status reports due in ~30min at team mtg [NA day time savings started]
Mar 13 10:31:49 <mbenitez>	nboldt, no kidiing :\
Mar 13 10:36:32 <scela>	mbenitez: np
Mar 13 10:38:45 <akurtakov>	so team meeting is 1h earlier today ??
Mar 13 10:39:16 <akurtakov>	sigh, /me looks for someone to go to kindergarden 
Mar 13 10:41:18 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, don't worry if you can't make it today, this change messes things up for a few weeks :\
Mar 13 10:42:09 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: np, already aranged - my wife is going 
Mar 13 10:42:16 <akurtakov>	I just missed that part :)
Mar 13 10:42:31 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, please thank her for me too
Mar 13 10:43:25 <nboldt>	akurtakov: same problem persists until Europe moves its clocks (weekend around April 1, iirc)
Mar 13 10:43:43 <akurtakov>	last weekend of March , yeah
Mar 13 10:53:52 <mbooth>	Obviously Canada should join EU so it's mandated that all our clocks change at the same time :-p
Mar 13 10:54:32 <nboldt>	mbooth: better solution: stop updating clocks every 6mo like the sensible part of the planet already doe

Mar 13 12:44:07 <lufimtse>	Done, thank you for reminder.
Mar 14 04:02:15 <akurtakov>	seriously, eclipse bz down again
Mar 14 05:51:05 <akurtakov>	mistria: scela: do you have your demo ready ?
Mar 14 05:55:34 <mistria>	akurtakov: it's in progress
Mar 14 09:43:50 <dbocharo>	please, could somebody help with configuring proxy for Eclipse on Fedora? I set global proxy on the laptop and can access internet through Chrome, but can't access anything through Internal Eclipse Browser. Configuring proxy in Preferences - didn't help. Also i can't disable SOCKS schema - possibly that could have helped. Always have: "Problem occurred while loading the URL http://google.com/Error resolving 'http': Name or service not kn
Mar 14 09:43:50 <dbocharo>	In windows it works fine
Mar 14 09:57:07 <scela>	dbocharo: in proxy preferences in eclipse, how have you set the 'Active provider' dropdown?
Mar 14 09:58:11 <dbocharo>	scela: yes, tried everything from there: Native, Direct and Manual
Mar 14 10:00:26 <scela>	dbocharo: normally if you just choose native (and do nothing else) it should pick up the OS proxy config
Mar 14 10:00:44 <scela>	dbocharo: how did the SOCKS schema get enabled as it should be off by default
Mar 14 10:02:37 <dbocharo>	scela: yes, i know about the native - but it doesn't work. 2 minutes, will make a small screencast
Mar 14 10:05:25 <scela>	dbocharo: what happens if you change to manual and leave the SOCKS data blank
Mar 14 10:08:17 <dbocharo>	scela: SOCKS data is blank, but i can't remove a tick from the first left column from SOCKS. "Clear" button also doesn't help
Mar 14 10:12:45 <dbocharo>	scela: when it is like this: clean but a tick for SOCKS - still can't access
Mar 14 10:16:53 <akurtakov>	scela: which plugin provides the proxy support
Mar 14 10:16:54 <scela>	dbocharo: supposing X is your installation folder, go to X/configuration/.settings
Mar 14 10:16:55 <scela>	dbocharo: do you have a org.eclipse.core.net.prefs file?
Mar 14 10:16:55 <scela>	dbocharo: if so, pastebin it
Mar 14 10:17:47 <scela>	org.eclipse.ui.net
Mar 14 10:20:29 <dbocharo>	scela: ok, one minute. Whilst, here is the screencast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkHd16l8wDM
Mar 14 10:23:54 <dbocharo>	scela: when have Manual active provider - there is an org.eclipse.core.net.prefs file: https://gist.github.com/bdshadow/5bfcaa5457c6fab4b463e7cc83f237ac
Mar 14 10:31:07 <scela>	dbocharo: if i paste those settings for me i can access the web via internal browser
Mar 14 10:32:14 <scela>	dbocharo: what's your build-id? 
Mar 14 10:32:26 <scela>	Help->about->build id: 
Mar 14 10:32:30 <dbocharo>	Build id: 20161208-0600
Mar 14 10:33:13 <scela>	anything suspicious in error log? Ctrl+3, 'err'
Mar 14 10:33:17 <scela>	dbocharo: ^
Mar 14 10:36:03 <dbocharo>	scela: it works for you even after you set proxy globally for Fedora like i do? (see my screencast)
Mar 14 10:36:21 <scela>	akurtakov: org.eclipse.ui.net provides proxy UI, org.eclipse.core.net provides api
Mar 14 10:36:40 <scela>	dbocharo: let me check again
Mar 14 10:37:07 <dbocharo>	scela: http://imgur.com/a/bTQYl
Mar 14 10:37:24 <dbocharo>	scela: very kind of you, if you try it. Thank you!
Mar 14 10:38:33 <akurtakov>	dbocharo: do you care to close and reopen the browser view ?
Mar 14 10:38:46 <akurtakov>	could it be that it's some kind of cache
Mar 14 10:38:52 <akurtakov>	or maybe even restart eclipse ?
Mar 14 10:39:40 <scela>	dbocharo: yes even if i set global proxy it still works for me
Mar 14 10:40:06 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: Group 2 demo / sprint review in~20min
Mar 14 10:40:07 <dbocharo>	akurtakov: i tried restarting eclipse after every change in preferences
Mar 14 10:40:08 <mbenitez>	https://redhat.bluejeans.com/6300487397/
Mar 14 10:41:08 <scela>	dbocharo: 
Mar 14 10:41:09 <scela>	https://imgur.com/a/SPIho
Mar 14 10:41:12 <dbocharo>	scela: thank you for the try. So it works when you set proxy for Fedora and then in Eclipse preferences chose Manual active provider ?
Mar 14 10:41:29 <scela>	dbocharo: screeshot says it all more or less
Mar 14 10:41:40 <dbocharo>	scela: yeah, i see
Mar 14 10:41:43 <scela>	note city, and country
Mar 14 10:41:54 <scela>	dbocharo: normally it would go out of Uithoorn, Netherlands
Mar 14 10:42:09 <scela>	dbocharo: but the screenshot is through the proxy in raleigh
Mar 14 10:44:10 <dbocharo>	scela: yes, i understand, i found where you are working from =) Really strange that it doesn't work for me
Mar 14 10:45:58 <scela>	dbocharo: do you have another instance of eclipse lying around?
Mar 14 10:47:02 <dbocharo>	scela: of course. Let me try
Mar 14 10:53:40 <dbocharo>	scela: doesn't work. Tried with another instance of the same version of Eclipse and with an older version 20160613-1800. 
Mar 14 10:53:53 <dbocharo>	scela: for me Error Log seems strange: http://imgur.com/a/bTQYl
Mar 14 10:57:13 <scela>	dbocharo: yes there's definitely something going on there
Mar 14 10:58:13 <scela>	dbocharo: i have a meeting in 3 mins so please file a bug in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Platform with more or less the details we discussed
Mar 14 10:58:42 <dbocharo>	scela: ok, thank you!
Mar 14 10:58:42 <scela>	also the screenshot of the error log
Mar 14 11:39:22 <mistria>	scela akurtakov mbenitez: so we don't demo our stuff?
Mar 14 11:39:48 <scela>	mistria: no idea
Mar 14 11:40:10 <mistria>	scela: seems we missed our slot
Mar 14 11:40:19 <mistria>	scela: it was taken by the many Che demos
Mar 14 11:40:23 <mbenitez>	mistria, scela I was trying to ask for us to go now but apparently I wasn;t heard
Mar 14 11:41:13 <mbenitez>	ok so end of the call :(
Mar 14 11:43:40 <scela>	is there a schedule for this call? or is it talking on demand ?
Mar 14 11:43:55 <rgrunber>	scela: there is a clear schedule..
Mar 14 11:44:03 <rgrunber>	https://docs.google.com/document/d/12NEqwo0D415VvDIx6lZ07xehHmykn1XOEUlOVXx-Fsg/edit# ? no?
Mar 14 11:44:44 <rgrunber>	i mean i would think talking is ordered by demo listing
Mar 14 11:48:38 <mistria>	mbenitez: when is the end of the call?
Mar 14 11:49:07 <mbenitez>	should be 12min, right after this demo
Mar 14 11:49:19 <mbenitez>	demos should be shorter than 12min
Mar 14 11:49:27 <mbenitez>	s/demos/demo
Mar 14 11:50:11 <scela>	mbenitez: you mean ours?
Mar 14 11:50:41 <mbenitez>	scela, I meant you should go right after this demo which should be not very long
Mar 14 11:51:09 <scela>	mbenitez: ok that was the plan actually from my side, 2-3 mins
Mar 14 11:51:18 <scela>	i'm surprised the rest are this long
Mar 14 11:51:25 <mbenitez>	unfortunately the call moderator didn't read the agenda and skipped us
Mar 14 11:51:43 <mbenitez>	scela, yes, not everybody is planning properly
Mar 14 11:51:54 <mbenitez>	and there's nobody enforcing that either :(
Mar 14 11:57:55 <akurtakov>	mistria: your turn ?
Mar 14 11:57:59 <mbenitez>	scela, thanks for that intro, good to see how it all fits together
Mar 14 12:03:18 <mbenitez>	mistria, from bluejeans chat: [Bartosz] can you guys share link to the source code for that? e.g. in the agenda doc?
Mar 14 12:03:55 <mbenitez>	[Todd] C# in Eclipse -- if I fall off my chair, please dial 9-1-1
Mar 14 12:05:49 <mbenitez>	scela, mistria thank you for the demos guys! and for waiting patiently for your turn
Mar 14 12:07:10 <dbocharo>	scela: akurtakov: i found the problem. When i set proxy for Fedora i specify the schema in the beginning of the address - https://youtu.be/RkHd16l8wDM?t=25 at 0:25. When i removed "http://" and "https://" from there - everything started to work in Eclipse - internet is now accessible from internal browser. Anyway i think Eclipse should be able to work with it, because it work from External browsers. WDYT?
Mar 14 12:07:35 <akurtakov>	sounds like a bug 
Mar 14 12:07:37 <scela>	dbocharo: did you file the bug? if so add this additional info in the bug and we'll take it from there
Mar 14 12:07:49 <scela>	mbenitez: np
Mar 14 12:08:02 <akurtakov>	demo was good btw
Mar 14 12:08:47 <dbocharo>	scela: not yet. I decided to test it once again and found the problem. Now i can file the bug, when i know the actual problem
Mar 14 12:09:13 <scela>	dbocharo: thanks. please do.
Mar 14 12:09:43 <scela>	akurtakov: thanks. i didn't know we were supposed to do video demo and i dislike them. so if I do them I'll do them live.
Mar 14 12:10:46 <scela>	mistria: btw, were you on double monitor when you shared your screen?
Mar 14 12:11:32 <rgrunber>	i'm starting to see why people can't stand bjn.. when you demoed the target editor, i was seeing the patch editor for the entire time.
Mar 14 12:12:57 <akurtakov>	same happened for me but during css to html editor
Mar 14 12:15:21 <mbenitez>	scela, I didn't request a pre-recorded video because: 1. usually take long to prepare, 2. often they fail on the demo day
Mar 14 12:15:29 <mbenitez>	live demos are good enough IMO
Mar 14 12:15:58 <scela>	mbenitez: i prefer live demo. also more exciting :)
Mar 14 12:16:02 <mbenitez>	scela, something I definitely forgot about was the intro 'slide' to give context to the demos, but what you did was very helpful
Mar 14 12:16:15 <scela>	mbenitez: i did that on the fly waiting for my turn :)
Mar 14 12:16:17 <mbenitez>	scela, I agree, so we can keep doing those
Mar 14 12:17:02 <scela>	mbenitez: as i saw other people had something similar 
Mar 14 12:17:38 <mbenitez>	scela, I thought so and I appreciate you doing that, sorry that escaped my mind
Mar 14 12:17:52 <scela>	mbenitez: but i think it's good enough. a powerpoint presentation with bells and whistles might be overkill
Mar 14 12:18:26 <mbenitez>	scela, I agree it can be taken too far
Mar 14 12:27:09 <mistria>	scela: yeah, I am using a double monitor
Mar 14 12:27:23 <mistria>	scela: but I also had some issue with Google Hangouts because of wayland
Mar 14 12:27:35 <mistria>	we're back in the time of Linux not able to share screen
Mar 14 12:27:55 <mistria>	now it works with projectors, but hardly with screen sharing services
Mar 14 12:34:07 <dbocharo>	scela: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=513655
Mar 14 12:42:09 <akurtakov>	mistria: still here ?
Mar 14 12:42:44 <mistria>	akurtakov: yeah, I'm back
Mar 14 12:43:01 <akurtakov>	mistria: so in help center
Mar 14 12:43:23 <akurtakov>	Platform Plug-in Developer Guide/Programmer's Guide/Editors
Mar 14 12:43:33 <akurtakov>	we have to plug the generic editor there
Mar 14 12:44:06 <akurtakov>	mistria: do you want me to open bug report about it
Mar 14 12:44:22 <mistria>	ok
Mar 14 12:44:28 <mistria>	yes, please file a bug
Mar 14 12:44:58 <akurtakov>	mistria: I'm still unsure whether we should have sectoin for generic editor on each page or different chapter
Mar 14 12:45:07 <akurtakov>	but we have to clear this up
Mar 14 12:46:09 <mistria>	akurtakov: it's definitely the best place to put anything
Mar 14 12:46:14 <mistria>	better than wiki
Mar 14 12:46:22 <mistria>	akurtakov: about organization, it can be tricky
Mar 14 12:47:10 <mistria>	akurtakov: we can split all pages in 3 parts:
Mar 14 12:47:12 <mistria>	1. Writing the code that does what you want (which class to implement)
Mar 14 12:47:14 <mistria>	2. Integrating it
Mar 14 12:47:16 <mistria>	2a. as a contribution to the Generic Editor
Mar 14 12:47:18 <mistria>	2b. in your own Editor class
Mar 14 12:48:56 <akurtakov>	mistria: let's go in smaller chunks
Mar 14 12:49:18 <akurtakov>	have generic editor being mentioned 
Mar 14 12:49:32 <akurtakov>	and each extension point covered in separate commit
Mar 14 12:49:44 <akurtakov>	mistria: I ask forthat cause this is area that Dani will review :)
Mar 14 12:50:15 <akurtakov>	so better to not get stuck in endless review :)
Mar 14 12:50:19 <mistria>	akurtakov: yeah, I'll try to get a preleminary approval from Dani before refactoring pages
Mar 14 12:55:04 *	akurtakov is done for today
Mar 14 15:30:52 <mbenitez>	ipun, rgrunber would be nice to send a reminder about your talks tomorrow
Mar 14 15:40:07 <rgrunber>	mbenitez: sure i'll reply on the thread reminding everyone.
Mar 14 15:45:07 <ipun>	thanks rgrunber 
Mar 15 10:18:59 <ipun>	thank you akurtakov for offically finalizing my fixes for DnD Wayland support :)
Mar 15 10:19:18 <akurtakov>	ipun: I hope we will not come to even more reverts :)
Mar 15 10:26:34 <ipun>	akurtakov: thats the dream
Mar 15 10:27:29 <akurtakov>	ipun: I'm really eager to start using wayland :)
Mar 15 10:27:37 <akurtakov>	I mean swt on wayland
Mar 15 10:30:12 <ipun>	akurtakov: same
Mar 15 12:27:22 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: do you know of replacements for things like Xvfb / Xvnc / vncserver, or even xdotool ? :P
Mar 15 12:27:39 <rgrunber>	stuff we take for granted on X

Mar 16 10:06:16 <mistria>	akurtakov: hi
Mar 16 10:06:29 <akurtakov>	mistria: what's up?
Mar 16 10:06:32 <mistria>	akurtakov: do you have some time to help about acute and embedded omnisharp?
Mar 16 10:06:49 <akurtakov>	mistria: you want me to just run mvn clean verify ?
Mar 16 10:06:58 <mistria>	akurtakov: yes please
Mar 16 10:07:05 <akurtakov>	mistria: doing it
Mar 16 10:07:18 <mistria>	akurtakov: and also, I've got another question: how did you set up OmniSharp before?
Mar 16 10:07:32 <mistria>	akurtakov: using environment variables? which one? which value?
Mar 16 10:07:33 <akurtakov>	I never managed to make it run tbh :)
Mar 16 10:07:42 <mistria>	ok :)
Mar 16 10:07:48 <mistria>	so at least, it's not a regression
Mar 16 10:07:57 <akurtakov>	always one two issues - and I give up
Mar 16 10:08:07 <mistria>	fair enough
Mar 16 10:08:21 <mistria>	do you have `node` in your path?
Mar 16 10:08:59 <akurtakov>	mistria: yes
Mar 16 10:09:41 <akurtakov>	nodejs-6.10.0-1.fc25
Mar 16 10:11:11 <akurtakov>	btw, I don't know what tycho-p2-plugin:1.0.0:p2-metadata-default does for the omnisharpServer bundle but it takes minutes 
Mar 16 10:11:52 <mistria>	it zipis and pack200 it
Mar 16 10:12:07 <mistria>	but as there are many files in it, it takes much time
Mar 16 10:12:17 <mistria>	ah no, this one doesn't zip, it generates metadata
Mar 16 10:12:27 <mistria>	but I think it does check all files in the jar
Mar 16 10:14:21 <mistria>	could be a nodejs version issue
Mar 16 10:14:26 <mistria>	I've 7.7.2
Mar 16 10:17:27 <akurtakov>	mistria: failed with [ERROR] Unable to read repository at http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/unzip/unzip/org/eclipse/acute/repository/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/repository-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip-unzip/plugins/org.eclipse.acute.omnisharpServer_0.1.0.201703131751.jar. 
Mar 16 10:17:55 <akurtakov>	mistria: network issue or smth is missing there ?
Mar 16 10:18:21 <mistria>	I don't get why it's trying to download it...
Mar 16 10:18:27 <mistria>	baseline check probably
Mar 16 10:18:39 <akurtakov>	mistria: I just run mvn clean verify :)
Mar 16 10:19:00 <mistria>	akurtakov: can you please put the detailed log somewhere?
Mar 16 10:19:05 <akurtakov>	it's such small things that stopped me most of the times :)
Mar 16 10:20:17 <akurtakov>	mistria: nothing fancy https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/FNvm6mhpoSliMzGw4BpEWF5M1UNdIGYhyRLivL9gydE=
Mar 16 10:20:33 <akurtakov>	rerunning it to check whether it's network 
Mar 16 10:28:57 <akurtakov>	mistria: failed in the same way
Mar 16 10:29:40 <mistria>	and can you reach the UR: with a browser?
Mar 16 10:37:22 <akurtakov>	mistria: yes, and worked on the 4th attempt

Mar 16 10:39:21 <akurtakov>	mistria: I have to run now but we can continue tomororw morning
Mar 16 10:40:41 <mistria>	if you have 2 sec, can you please send me the content of org.eclipse.acute.tests/target/work/data/.metadata/.log ?

Mar 17 16:31:37 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: is your command runner work (building on the container) in cdt master.. or was it just a branch/pull request..
Mar 17 16:32:53 <rgrunber>	i tried installing container support from download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/builds/master/nightly/ but it only copies over the binary..
Mar 17 17:39:24 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: my command runner work is split up: for CDT it is in my github jjohnstn/containerBuild branch while the linux tools portion is in the containerBuild branch of Linux Tools
Mar 17 17:39:52 <rgrunber>	ah ok, so not in master yet.
Mar 17 17:40:37 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: no, it will be a while since it is quite a major change that needs to be approved..I am currently working on indexing support but build is working fine for the 3 old types of projects

Mar 20 11:35:01 <mbenitez>	mbooth, sounds good! will do that
Mar 20 11:35:04 <scela>	mistria: i'll just go through with it and tell you what happens
Mar 20 11:35:13 <mistria>	scela: ok, thanks
Mar 20 11:36:31 <scela>	mistria: master branch?
Mar 20 11:36:38 <mistria>	scela: yeah
Mar 20 11:36:46 <mistria>	scela: I don't think there is another branch
Mar 20 11:41:50 <scela>	mistria: it's been downloading stuff for a while :)
Mar 20 11:50:01 <akurtakov>	scela: dtp also uses lucene :)
Mar 20 11:50:09 <akurtakov>	so please add it to your list :)
Mar 20 11:51:49 <scela>	akurtakov: ok
Mar 20 11:51:51 <scela>	akurtakov: will do
Mar 20 11:53:12 <akurtakov>	scela: that should be the simplest one in terms of code :0
Mar 20 11:53:13 <mistria>	scela: what's been downloading Maven or the test?
Mar 20 11:54:08 <akurtakov>	scela: my patch for Lucene 5 would probably be good start http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/eclipse-dtp.git/commit/eclipse-dtp-lucene5-port.patch?id=4a67961a267d2a54b10d0934b157e074ea66a038
Mar 20 11:59:07 <scela>	mistria: it downloaded the whole wide world and it started building
Mar 20 12:00:03 <scela>	mistria: build failed because of the tests org.eclipse.acute.tests
Mar 20 12:01:03 <scela>	mistria: IOException: can't run program '/bin/bash'
Mar 20 12:01:40 <scela>	akurtakov: ok i'll take a look tomorrow
Mar 20 12:02:43 <mistria>	scela: ok, on Windows, it makes a lot of sense ;)
Mar 20 12:04:11 <scela>	mistria: yep, that's linux specific so you'd have to fix that somehow
Mar 20 12:04:21 <scela>	mistria: want me to test something else for now?
Mar 20 12:05:12 <mistria>	scela: no, unless you want to try to add the condition for Windows and use "cmd /C" (IIRC) instead of /bin/bash there
Mar 20 12:06:57 <scela>	mistria: where do i do that? i'm not familiar at all with the code there

Mar 20 13:51:00 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: would you please reply to markus https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=503431
Mar 20 13:53:20 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: anyway I reassigned the followup bug to you
Mar 20 14:17:30 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok
Mar 20 14:18:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I have a fix in progress.
Mar 20 14:21:25 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: any chance you can land it today so tomorrows build have results
Mar 20 14:21:31 <lufimtse>	Yes
Mar 20 14:21:38 <lufimtse>	I have a quickfix, but want to implement better fix.
Mar 20 14:21:50 <lufimtse>	if I don't get a better fix done in time, I'll merge quickfix for now.
Mar 20 14:22:08 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ok, perfect
Mar 21 05:05:50 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Morning, is there something wrong with Eclipse signing server?
Mar 21 05:05:58 <mbooth>	I keep seeing "jarsigner: unable to sign jar: java.net.UnknownHostException: timestamp.geotrust.com"
Mar 21 05:06:04 <akurtakov>	mbooth: yeah, it's down :)
Mar 21 05:06:09 <mbooth>	Aha
Mar 21 05:06:30 <akurtakov>	mbooth: btw, have you seen the menu bug ?
Mar 21 05:06:38 <akurtakov>	err, launcher 
Mar 21 05:06:53 <mbooth>	Which bug is that?
Mar 21 05:07:05 <akurtakov>	mbooth: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1434121
Mar 21 05:07:28 <akurtakov>	mbooth: shouldn't be an issue
Mar 21 05:07:43 <akurtakov>	and we have to get it for 2.4
Mar 21 05:08:12 <mbooth>	Sure, should be trivial enough
Mar 21 05:09:25 <akurtakov>	mbooth: it's the first customer request I'm aware of so we have to fix it :)
Mar 21 05:10:26 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Yeah, and it makes perfect sense -- I assumed people would always just use the latest
Mar 21 05:10:59 <mbooth>	But there is no upgrade path between SCLs
Mar 21 05:12:28 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Is there an eclipse infra status page, btw? I thought there was, but I can't seem to find it
Mar 21 05:48:21 <scela>	mbooth: https://dev.eclipse.org/committers/help/status.php
Mar 21 05:49:41 <mbooth>	scela: Thanks
Mar 21 07:48:50 <scela>	akurtakov: dtp seems to be already ported https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=510294#c11
Mar 21 07:50:42 <akurtakov>	scela: even better
Mar 21 07:51:11 <akurtakov>	scela: I missed the fact that they finished it
Mar 21 07:53:48 <scela>	akurtakov: i think they did it wrong though
Mar 21 07:53:54 <scela>	as they have 3 out of 6 tests failing
Mar 21 07:54:02 <scela>	akurtakov: want me to spend more time on this?
Mar 21 07:54:42 <akurtakov>	scela: not more than a day or two
Mar 21 07:55:55 <scela>	akurtakov: nah i'll just give a quick look if i can fix their tests

Mar 21 08:21:23 <scela>	i pointed it out to them
Mar 21 08:21:33 <scela>	in case they want to change it i can help at a later point
Mar 21 08:22:04 <akurtakov>	scela: perfect
Mar 21 08:22:07 <akurtakov>	good enough for now
Mar 21 08:22:10 <scela>	yep
Mar 21 08:22:16 <scela>	next one is pydev right?
Mar 21 08:22:32 <scela>	akurtakov: ^
Mar 21 08:22:45 <akurtakov>	scela: that would be great
Mar 21 08:22:55 <scela>	akurtakov: do you have a L5 patch?
Mar 21 08:23:03 <scela>	akurtakov: that helps to narrow down the list of plugins i need to touch
Mar 21 08:23:09 <akurtakov>	scela: it is at L5 already
Mar 21 08:23:38 <akurtakov>	scela: https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev/tree/master/plugins/org.python.pydev.shared_core/libs
Mar 21 08:23:43 <akurtakov>	it ships lucene itself
Mar 21 08:23:46 <scela>	akurtakov: right
Mar 21 08:23:53 <scela>	akurtakov: i even think i did myself :)
Mar 21 08:24:38 <scela>	or probably i patched it in fedora
Mar 21 08:24:42 <scela>	anyway i'll check it
Mar 21 08:27:06 <scela>	akurtakov: yep it seems i ported it myself https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev/commit/c9646675c8943f4d5d6d6cb2708809266fd2a216
Mar 21 08:27:15 <scela>	akurtakov: so many lucene ports i'm forgetting i did them
Mar 21 08:28:36 <akurtakov>	scela: not surprising :)
Mar 21 09:51:43 <scela>	akurtakov: https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev/pull/196
Mar 21 09:53:05 <akurtakov>	cool, now we just have to wait for Fabio to apply it :)
Mar 21 09:54:03 <akurtakov>	ideally, pydev should have lucene bundles in it's p2 repo and bundle requrie them instead of putting them in
Mar 21 09:54:27 <akurtakov>	mbooth: ^^ maybe you or nboldt can handle that once scela's patch is in
Mar 21 09:54:45 <nboldt>	akurtakov: context?
Mar 21 09:55:00 <akurtakov>	[15:51] <scela> akurtakov: https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev/pull/196
Mar 21 09:55:02 <akurtakov>	[15:53] <akurtakov> cool, now we just have to wait for Fabio to apply it [15:54] <-- nboldt (~nboldt@ovpn-117-71.ams2.redhat.com) has left this server (Quit: Leaving.).
Mar 21 09:55:03 <akurtakov>	[15:54] <akurtakov> ideally, pydev should have lucene bundles in it's p2 repo and bundle requrie them instead of putting them in
Mar 21 09:55:32 <nboldt>	ah. sure. this is pydev in fedora rpm? or upstream somewhere?
Mar 21 09:55:58 <akurtakov>	nboldt: I would rather see it upstream and fedora rpm will get way simpler thanks to that
Mar 21 09:56:03 <mbooth>	It should happen upstream
Mar 21 09:56:30 <nboldt>	happy to help but need some pointers to where stuff lives. is https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev the origin/master project? Or is there one at eclipse.org?
Mar 21 09:57:19 <akurtakov>	that's the main repo where work happens
Mar 21 09:57:22 <mbooth>	nboldt: It's not an eclipse.org project
Mar 21 09:57:47 <nboldt>	ah, ok. curious... bad license terms? or just never contrib'd to eclipse.org?
Mar 21 09:58:54 <akurtakov>	nboldt: never contributed, Fabio is trying to monetize on it
Mar 21 09:58:54 <scela>	nboldt: more like the case of a 'difficult' developer
Mar 21 09:59:54 <scela>	akurtakov: i'd be happy to change his stuff to orbit if there is agreement
Mar 21 10:00:06 <scela>	akurtakov: i consider this closed until he reacts so ping me if something else is needed from me
Mar 21 10:00:13 <akurtakov>	scela: yeah, sure
Mar 21 10:00:34 *	akurtakov still remembers the "I don't review more than a patch per week " times of pydev :)
Mar 21 10:00:36 <nboldt>	so... I'm seeing a mishmash of builders... some shell, some ant, some py, some tycho/maven.
Mar 21 10:01:09 <akurtakov>	nboldt: even the site is in this repo
Mar 21 10:01:16 <nboldt>	I presume the latest and only maintained update site definition is https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev/blob/master/features/org.python.pydev.p2-repo/category.xml ... not https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev/blob/master/builders/org.python.pydev.build/site.xml
Mar 21 10:01:50 <nboldt>	so we'd just need to add third party lucene to that and make sure the tycho pom can resolve it at build time. Easy peasy. I can throw together a PR
Mar 21 10:02:36 <akurtakov>	nboldt: yeah, but let's wait for him to get scela's patch first
Mar 21 10:02:53 <akurtakov>	and third party lucene should ideally come from orbit 
Mar 21 10:04:23 <akurtakov>	nboldt: if/when you start look at it - please consider doing the same for the other jars bundled if they are available from orbit :)
Mar 21 10:05:22 <akurtakov>	list is http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/eclipse-pydev.git/tree/eclipse-pydev.spec#n132
Mar 21 10:05:50 <akurtakov>	the less we have to fight with this on fedora side the better
Mar 21 10:08:40 <nboldt>	well, my patch can include scela's patch 
Mar 21 10:08:58 <nboldt>	so it would be a one-two punch... update to latest lucene AND get it from orbit / into the update site
Mar 21 10:14:34 <nboldt>	akurtakov: is there an issue tracker for pydev? or just github PRs ?
Mar 21 10:14:47 <nboldt>	can't find anything linked from GH or http://www.pydev.org/developers.html
Mar 21 10:14:54 <akurtakov>	nboldt: just github PRs
Mar 21 10:15:17 <akurtakov>	please don't squash the patches
Mar 21 10:15:38 <nboldt>	actually I found https://www.brainwy.com/tracker/PyDev/
Mar 21 10:15:42 <akurtakov>	I can see him rejecting referring to external bundles but this should not block the move to lucene 6
Mar 21 10:18:17 <scela>	nboldt: i also think it's a good idea to hold
Mar 21 10:18:37 <nboldt>	scela: ok, I can work locally and submit ticket & PR when you guys are ready
Mar 21 10:18:42 <nboldt>	or wait entirely :D
Mar 21 10:18:58 *	nboldt goes back to hacking about on jenkins jobs
Mar 21 10:20:34 <akurtakov>	nboldt: I appreciate the enthusiasm - will keep you informed of other actionable items :)
Mar 21 10:23:40 <nboldt>	akurtakov: no worries. /me likes to hack on new projects :D (And I haven't used pydev yet -- I do my python writing in Sublime so thought it'd be a good oppty to try something new)
Mar 22 10:05:45 <nboldt1>	mbooth: so... any desire to start on Neon.3 updates to rh-eclipse-* today? Or do we wait until the official announcement tomorrow at around 10am EST?
Mar 22 10:07:52 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, beat me to it, was going to contact you and mbooth about this since qe was done last week
Mar 22 10:08:39 <nboldt1>	yeah, I've been distracted working on job optimization but with the RHSCL call on right now I was reminded that we have to move up to Neon.3 real soon now
Mar 22 10:16:34 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: is it worth mentioning on this call that we plan to change the rh-eclipse-* content in RHSCL for devstudio 10.4 updates (eg., line 192 of etherpad)
Mar 22 10:17:11 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, not now, we'll just create confusion
Mar 22 10:17:29 <nboldt1>	ok, cool. same question re: lines 154-155
Mar 22 10:17:36 <nboldt1>	but I guess same answer :D
Mar 22 10:17:37 <mbenitez>	let's define a schedule: when builds will be ready, when QE can test and then we present that
Mar 22 10:17:44 <nboldt1>	excellent
Mar 22 10:18:22 <mbenitez>	I think those dates would be for everybody, maybe the sched for 2.4 is moving :\
Mar 22 10:18:38 <nboldt1>	I expect the devstudio rpm will be updated and building by week's end or Monday at the latest (if the Neon.3 mirroring takes longer than expected / craps out, or if the TP update requires some unexpected fiddling)
Mar 22 10:19:12 <nboldt1>	GA date is still Apr 26-27 on line 192-193
Mar 22 10:19:41 <nboldt1>	and the launch phase ends the day after the announcement, for some odd reason *smh*
Mar 22 10:19:46 <mbenitez>	yes, I don't know who asked about the dev time or why then
Mar 22 10:20:12 <nboldt1>	line 158-9 looks like Vladimir's pen
Mar 22 10:20:44 <nboldt1>	... or Joe
Mar 22 10:23:00 <mbenitez>	based on what Kerri is saying, it'd be great if we had the upgrades for end of next week for vkadlcik 
Mar 22 10:23:09 <mbenitez>	then we can avoid a zstream
Mar 22 10:23:47 <nboldt1>	I need TP updated and locked down by Mar 28
Mar 22 10:24:12 <nboldt1>	so that's the date I'm working with -- obviously sooner is better but that's the last date we can change it for this AM2 milestone
Mar 22 10:25:02 <nboldt1>	will definitely have devstudio TP and rpm updated by Tuesday Mat 28 next week
Mar 22 10:25:36 <nboldt1>	as I'm not sure what's involved in updating fedora or rh-eclipse46-* packages, the other updates are up to mbooth (or up to his teaching me how to help) :D
Mar 22 10:25:40 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, please coordinate with mbooth that sounds tight but since you may help might work
Mar 22 10:44:54 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: nboldt1: what would you update in TP ?
Mar 22 10:45:43 <nboldt1>	akurtakov: the usual stuff... eclipse platform, webtools, rse/tm, mylyn, egit, ...
Mar 22 10:46:41 <akurtakov>	ah, ok - I somehow thought it's some other change
Mar 22 10:47:10 <nboldt1>	https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms/blob/4.62.x/jbosstools/multiple/jbosstools-multiple.target ... search for each and every <repository> tag ... each one could be updated to a new URL for migrating from Neon.2 -> Neon.3
Mar 22 10:47:23 <nboldt1>	nope, just updating to Neon.3 bits
Mar 22 10:48:17 <nboldt1>	then those changes trickle down to the devstudio update site, installer, and rpm
Mar 22 10:49:01 <nboldt1>	and when rh-eclipse46-* deps are updated, the rpm changes to exclude stuff that's available from upstream rpm rather than being included in the update site in the devstudio copr rpm
Mar 22 10:51:18 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, it should be the usual
Mar 22 10:52:36 <akurtakov>	mbooth: I'm curious in your eval
Mar 22 10:53:04 <akurtakov>	can you do in this timeframe ? also you should finally get nboldt1 onboard with this work
Mar 22 10:55:11 <mbenitez>	yes, payback time ;)
Mar 22 10:56:12 <nboldt1>	mbenitez: payback/turnaround/education time
Mar 22 10:57:09 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, I of course meant education time :D
Mar 22 14:16:38 *	scox is away: pto
Mar 23 08:33:52 <scela>	mistria: hey
Mar 23 08:34:38 <scela>	mistria: fyi just verified with last night's build that the template is fully working now and generate a working application with error reporting, autocomplete, hover and syntax highlighting
Mar 23 08:37:30 <akurtakov>	scela: mistria: have you considered adding word completion to the generic editor
Mar 23 08:37:37 <akurtakov>	does it sound like a good idea to you?
Mar 23 08:38:46 <scela>	akurtakov: not sure what you mean with 'word' completion
Mar 23 08:39:06 <akurtakov>	scela: completing word that already exist in the document
Mar 23 08:39:57 <scela>	akurtakov: regardless off any kind of semantics?
Mar 23 08:40:09 <akurtakov>	scela: yes
Mar 23 08:40:22 <akurtakov>	it would need a way to be disabled though
Mar 23 08:41:03 <scela>	akurtakov: it would yes
Mar 23 08:41:09 <scela>	akurtakov: not very thrilled by this idea
Mar 23 08:41:36 <scela>	akurtakov: any specific usecase you have in mind where it would be useful?
Mar 23 08:42:19 <akurtakov>	well, it's useful in the case where you don't have any more meaningful completion
Mar 23 08:42:50 <akurtakov>	scela: e.g. when editing js in kwrite
Mar 23 08:43:08 <akurtakov>	if I do line 1: var dummyVar = 1;
Mar 23 08:43:30 <akurtakov>	and on line 3 I start typing dumm I get the proposal to autocomplete it to dummyVar
Mar 23 08:43:40 <akurtakov>	It's dump if you have full tooling
Mar 23 08:43:48 <akurtakov>	but if you don't it's quite useful
Mar 23 08:44:08 <scela>	i see
Mar 23 08:44:31 <scela>	we could use it as default if no other kind of autocompletion is registered
Mar 23 08:44:39 <akurtakov>	smth like this yea
Mar 23 08:44:48 <scela>	akurtakov: what do you define as a word though
Mar 23 08:45:25 <akurtakov>	sequence of chars limited by whitespace chars on both sides :)
Mar 23 08:45:55 <akurtakov>	scela: ^
Mar 23 08:45:59 <scela>	<tag>bla</tag> would show up whole as an autocompletion though
Mar 23 08:46:31 <akurtakov>	hmm, I haven't thought of markup
Mar 23 08:47:05 <scela>	it usually involves such stuff unless you're writing poems :)
Mar 23 08:47:24 <akurtakov>	well, I don't consider js/python/ruby poems :)
Mar 23 08:47:52 <scela>	yeah but still you have stuff like v1=v2
Mar 23 08:48:13 <scela>	which means you'd get all that on a v_
Mar 23 08:48:29 <scela>	or v2){
Mar 23 08:48:58 <scela>	we could delimit on anything non-alphanumeric though
Mar 23 08:49:09 <akurtakov>	yeah, sounds good idea
Mar 23 08:49:25 <akurtakov>	perl people are on their own :)
Mar 23 08:49:37 <mbooth>	Or what about auto-completing based on words from the dictionary, so I can use it when writing comments in my own language
Mar 23 08:50:06 <scela>	mbooth: you mean natural language or programming language?
Mar 23 08:50:29 <akurtakov>	mbooth: that's another thing that mistria has slightly started
Mar 23 08:50:39 <mbooth>	Natural language -- based on the dictionary configured in "Text Editors"->"Spelling"
Mar 23 08:50:56 <akurtakov>	if we ever get the notion of __natural_language partition enabling such things for this partitions would make perfect sense
Mar 23 08:51:38 <akurtakov>	s/if/when/ :)
Mar 23 08:52:01 <scela>	mbooth: i always found quite awkward when thinking about autocompletion on natural language
Mar 23 08:52:25 <scela>	mbooth: i think it's usually faster to type it rather than to scroll through alternatives
Mar 23 08:52:29 <scela>	but maybe that's just me
Mar 23 08:53:05 <mbooth>	scela: I sometimes find myself typing Ctrl+Space in LibreOffice or something and then remembering, "Oh right, this is not my IDE"
Mar 23 08:53:21 <mistria>	If you know enough about your language to decide where to put word completion, that would work
Mar 23 08:53:28 <akurtakov>	scela: well, or you're like me and have grammar issues so autocomplete saves me time wondering what the spelling was :P
Mar 23 08:53:36 <mistria>	the LSP demos I have done involve such a natural language and a dictionary
Mar 23 08:55:07 <scela>	we could do something like this:
Mar 23 08:55:09 <akurtakov>	mistria: yeah, it's about providing more building blocks easily/by default
Mar 23 08:55:25 <scela>	if no autocomplete registered, we autocomplete on natural words and tokens delimited by non-alphanumerics
Mar 23 08:57:01 <nboldt>	mbooth: so I have two accounts w/ FAS... the old one (nickboldt) is also associated with redhat bugzilla, apparently, and dates back to 2008. The new one (nboldt) is about 10 mins old. :D
Mar 23 08:57:31 <mbooth>	D'oh
Mar 23 08:57:42 <mbooth>	nboldt: Which one are you going to use?
Mar 23 08:57:58 <nboldt>	yeah, created a new one because I couldn't get into the old one... then found the email/pwd associated w/ the old one
Mar 23 08:58:12 <nboldt>	so might as well use the old one as it's got more SLAs already signed
Mar 23 08:58:37 <nboldt>	and it's already got RH bugzilla attached to it; the new one not so much
Mar 23 08:59:03 <mbooth>	Cool
Mar 23 09:02:06 <nboldt>	mbooth: unfortunately this means I'll have a 3rd email address to associate w/ git repos :(
Mar 23 09:02:37 <nboldt>	... one for Eclipse.org, one for github.com, and another for fedoraproject.org
Mar 23 09:02:46 <nboldt>	*le sigh*
Mar 23 09:03:13 <mbooth>	nboldt: I don't the email address you use for git makes any difference since the auth is done with pubkeys
Mar 23 09:03:40 <nboldt>	ah, was reading thru the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join_the_package_collection_maintainers#Install_the_developer_client_tools doc and it talks about setting git config globals
Mar 23 09:04:05 <nboldt>	which I can't do because I have a different email address for most of the stuff I do (@redhat.com for github)
Mar 23 09:04:42 <mbooth>	I think these instructions are for people new-to-git
Mar 23 09:05:11 <mbooth>	I just use @redhat.com for all git repos, even if my user account has something different associated with it
Mar 23 09:05:16 <mbooth>	Git doesn't care
Mar 23 09:06:42 <nboldt>	ok. for eclipse, gerrit reviews need signoffs in commit msgs, and signoffs have to match with the email address assoc'd with the committer agreements... so for Eclipse PRs I DO have to worry about it. Glad fedora doesn't gaf.
Mar 23 09:12:05 <akurtakov>	mistria: ^ what do you think about scela proposal
Mar 23 09:12:39 <mistria>	akurtakov scela: I don't have an opinion, what do you think?
Mar 23 09:13:18 <mistria>	akurtakov: first we'd need a dictionaryContentAssistProcessor, which AFAIK doesn't exist yet
Mar 23 09:13:33 <akurtakov>	I'm not sold on the dictionary complete by default - there would be too many options in too many places , being opt-in somehow sounds better to me
Mar 23 09:14:10 <mistria>	akurtakov: ok, in that case, we can try to provide the content assist processor which does that, and let people use it
Mar 23 09:14:18 <mistria>	akurtakov: but that'd mean making it an API
Mar 23 09:14:33 <mistria>	akurtakov: so they can reference it in their plugin.xml or editor
Mar 23 09:15:00 <mbooth>	nboldt: I locally built a specfile once that contained "git config user.email something@someplace.com" which clobbered my git config and the next commit I made to Fedora had that email address.... And that's when I started religiously using mock....
Mar 23 09:15:04 <scela>	akurtakov: mistria we could start small with non-alphanumeric delimiters
Mar 23 09:15:11 <scela>	and see where that goes
Mar 23 09:15:13 <akurtakov>	mistria: or we auto attach it to __natural_language partition as you mentioned in some other bug
Mar 23 09:15:52 <akurtakov>	and request adapters to have it for it to auto-enable 
Mar 23 09:15:56 <akurtakov>	wdyt?
Mar 23 09:16:07 <mistria>	akurtakov: yeah, but we'd need to define that partition somewhere. It hsould be an API (but since it's just a string symbol, it's OK to not have it api but still let people use it)
Mar 23 09:16:27 <mistria>	akurtakov: then the job of adopters would become to set the partition type where it makes sense
Mar 23 09:16:32 <akurtakov>	yup
Mar 23 09:16:36 <mistria>	akurtakov: writing a document provider and so on
Mar 23 09:16:56 <akurtakov>	regarding the autocomplete of words existing in the document by default
Mar 23 09:16:57 <mistria>	akurtakov: it's adding an (optional) layer of complexity to the generic editor approach though
Mar 23 09:17:36 <scela>	mistria: yeah I'm more looking at it from a direct user POV and the benefits there, rather than developers through API
Mar 23 09:17:41 <scela>	akurtakov: cc^
Mar 23 09:18:55 <akurtakov>	scela: my issue with dictionary being enabled everywhere by default is typing "un" and pressing ctrl+space and getting hundred+ proposals 
Mar 23 09:19:25 <scela>	akurtakov: fair point
Mar 23 09:20:01 <scela>	that's why i said we could just start with non-a/n delimiters on existing text in the file
Mar 23 09:20:05 <mistria>	akurtakov: IIRC the spelling service already has an option to limit its results for quick assist
Mar 23 09:20:37 <akurtakov>	scela: that one I like and use in simpler text editors
Mar 23 09:21:00 <akurtakov>	and if no other completion is enabled it makes sense for me
Mar 23 09:22:48 <akurtakov>	fwiw, I would like to get it in shelled :)
Mar 23 09:23:31 <scela>	akurtakov: wdym shelled?
Mar 23 09:23:44 <mistria>	akurtakov: when you say no other completion is enabled, you mean "editors doesn't know any other processor" or "none of the available processors return a proposal" ?
Mar 23 09:24:05 <scela>	mistria: i'd say the first is safer
Mar 23 09:24:08 <akurtakov>	scela: https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/shell-script-dltk#group-metrics-tab
Mar 23 09:24:45 <scela>	akurtakov: ah ok :)
Mar 23 09:25:01 <akurtakov>	scela: it's my new test plugin 
Mar 23 09:25:12 <mistria>	akurtakov: ranking #26, not bad at all!
Mar 23 09:25:42 <akurtakov>	improving dltk api, starting use of tm4e fro now, once moved to oxygen even genericediotr :)
Mar 23 09:25:55 <mistria>	It's way higher than Docker tools
Mar 23 09:26:09 <akurtakov>	mistria: it's amazing that this plugin which I spend less than a week per year on is so high
Mar 23 09:26:33 <akurtakov>	that's one of the proofs that what is missing is basic tooling
Mar 23 09:26:43 <akurtakov>	parser/highlighting/etc. is crap
Mar 23 09:26:50 <akurtakov>	but it's better than nothing :)
Mar 23 09:28:10 <akurtakov>	mistria: it's not surprising - there are way more people edigint *.sh files than running docker
Mar 23 09:28:33 <akurtakov>	probably every software product have at least one such file in it
Mar 23 09:30:30 <mistria>	akurtakov: it's not that basic if you compare to most editors
Mar 23 09:30:30 <mistria>	akurtakov: it has some completion, some hover...
Mar 23 09:30:30 <mistria>	akurtakov; that's why I use it over vim most of the time
Mar 23 09:30:30 <mistria>	akurtakov: however, it does a lot of work in the ui thread apparently ;)
Mar 23 09:32:21 <akurtakov>	mistria: for and ide editor it's the bare minimum IMHO :)
Mar 23 09:32:47 <mistria>	akurtakov: right, but it's much more that syntax highlighting ;)
Mar 23 09:32:47 <akurtakov>	and overall time spend on it over last 5 years is probably less than 2 months
Mar 23 09:33:09 <akurtakov>	which I would like to replace with tm4e as that's exactly quite broken
Mar 23 09:34:43 <akurtakov>	mistria: btw, feel free to open bugs for UI thread work if you spot it
Mar 23 09:35:02 <akurtakov>	I'm not going to look for it but when someone opens bug I try to fix it
Mar 23 09:35:19 <scela>	mbooth: quick q: what's regex for 'any non-alphanumerical character'?
Mar 23 09:35:39 <mbooth>	scela: Probably something like [^a-zA-Z]
Mar 23 09:35:53 <mbooth>	scela: Oh, alphanumeric? [^a-zA-Z1-9]
Mar 23 09:36:09 <mbooth>	(The ^ is "not")
Mar 23 09:36:45 <scela>	mbooth: so String[] props = text.split("^a-zA-Z1-9");
Mar 23 09:37:05 <scela>	would give me all strings between non alphanumericals right?
Mar 23 09:37:43 <mbooth>	scela: You need the square brackets [ ] (to signify character class)
Mar 23 09:37:58 <mbooth>	Otherwise the ^ means start of line
Mar 23 09:39:18 <scela>	mbooth: right ok
Mar 23 09:39:40 *	scela uses bad language towards regexp but acknowledges it does the job
Mar 23 09:39:47 <mbooth>	That will match any non-alphanumeric char... To get a whole string, you may need something like: [^a-zA-Z0-9]+
Mar 23 09:40:06 <mbooth>	(Note I am not testing these before I type them in here :-)
Mar 23 09:40:44 <scela>	mbooth: sure that's quite above my level which is copy-paste-test what you give me :)
Mar 23 09:41:23 <mbooth>	And it may not capture the fancy ç in your name -- if you care for that sort of thing :-)

Mar 23 09:42:30 <mbooth>	Hah
Mar 23 09:43:11 <akurtakov>	what about \w ?
Mar 23 09:43:37 <mbooth>	akurtakov: \w also captures underscore _
Mar 23 09:43:58 <akurtakov>	perfect :)
Mar 23 09:44:24 <akurtakov>	so test_value will be one word :)
Mar 23 09:45:02 <mbooth>	For eg, [^\w] is equivilent to [^a-zA-Z0-9_]
Mar 23 09:45:33 <akurtakov>	hmm, that simple ? I thought it takes care of catchin non-latin chars
Mar 23 09:46:15 <mbooth>	akurtakov: IIRC I looked this up before and it was that simple :-(
Mar 23 09:46:26 <akurtakov>	so much for my hopes
Mar 23 09:46:28 <akurtakov>	:)
Mar 23 09:51:46 <scela>	mbooth: another problem which might be solved with regexp
Mar 23 09:52:10 <scela>	i have as big text which ends with <bla
Mar 23 09:52:34 <scela>	i need to find the last occurence of a non-alphanumeric character before a given offset
Mar 23 09:52:54 <scela>	in this case cursor is after 'a' and I want to get index of '<'
Mar 23 09:53:41 <mbooth>	scela: You'll probably need to use "lookahead" feature... Let me look up syntax, I don't use it often
Mar 23 09:54:37 <scela>	so imagine a method int askMat(String s, int offset) which returns the index of the last non-a/n *character* before 'offset'
Mar 23 09:55:03 <scela>	mbooth: ^
Mar 23 10:02:59 <mbooth>	scela: 
Mar 23 10:03:03 <mbooth>	That was hard
Mar 23 10:03:04 <mbooth>	[^\w](?!.*[^\w])
Mar 23 10:03:40 <mbooth>	Assuming you can truncate the string at the offset, that should give you the "last occurance" of a non-alphanumeric
Mar 23 10:04:33 <mbooth>	The "?!" is the negative lookahead
Mar 23 10:05:06 <mbooth>	"Any of this character class, not followed by the same character class"
Mar 23 10:21:50 <scela>	mbooth: so I do a match on that regexp?
Mar 23 10:27:25 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: monthly RHDeveloper call in ~3min https://primetime.bluejeans.com/a2m/live-event/mk60957
Mar 23 10:29:05 <mbooth>	scela: Yeah, I assume you can get the index of the match from the java Matcher object or something like that
Mar 23 12:06:24 <lufimtse>	hey ya. https://git.eclipse.org/c/ seems broken. If I click on a repository (e.g platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git), then it just reloads the same page. Seems like linking is broken because if I enter url: https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git  then the related page loads.
Mar 23 12:06:30 <lufimtse>	Does anyone else get this?
Mar 23 12:09:38 <lufimtse>	akurtakov,  ^ do you get that as well?
Mar 23 12:10:06 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: works for me
Mar 23 12:10:30 <akurtakov>	but considering that even google was down for me yesterday everything can happen :)
Mar 23 12:11:13 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Mar 23 12:14:44 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok, never mind. Works again for me. Must have been a glitch in the matrix.
Mar 24 08:33:30 *	scox is back (gone 00:00:14)
Mar 24 11:12:19 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: question for you re: Docker tooling deps... why do you depend on org.apache.http 4.4.1 and not 4.4.x? 
Mar 24 11:17:53 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: I'm trying to add docker tools feature org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.feature_2.3.0.201703072040 to our JBT TP, and it's looking for package o.apache.http 4.4.1
Mar 24 11:18:07 <nboldt>	re: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-23963?focusedCommentId=13383921&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13383921
Mar 24 11:23:39 <nboldt>	... way have found a workaround
Mar 24 11:46:23 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: dependencies are set by docker-client pom file deps (i.e. what has been tested)...rgrunberg occasionally tests higher deps and pushes them forward to match current versions to eliminate issues such as this
Mar 24 11:47:09 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: yeah, seems like you moved up a lot of deps and added new ones ... so I'm just forcing our TP to use 0.0.0 versions so it'll automatically pull the latest 
Mar 24 11:47:21 <nboldt>	... and iterating through all the new packages on which you depend :(
Mar 27 06:45:07 <mistria>	scela: hey, wassup?

Mar 27 14:14:01 <rgrunber>	nboldt: have you ever had to deal with the Authenticator API ? .. NetAuthenticator.. ? UserValidationDialog ?..
Mar 27 14:14:21 <nboldt>	rgrunber: nope, nope, hells no
Mar 27 14:15:22 <rgrunber>	heh.. fair enough..
Mar 27 15:02:41 <nboldt>	rgrunber: is it possible to have a @REDHAT and @FEDORAPROJECT kerberos ticket simultaneously? 
Mar 27 15:02:52 <rgrunber>	nboldt: should be
Mar 27 15:03:07 <nboldt>	but when I kinit the first one it kills the second one
Mar 27 15:03:07 <rgrunber>	just gotta do 'kinit user@..'
Mar 27 15:03:10 <rgrunber>	and all are stored in klist
Mar 27 15:05:10 <rgrunber>	hmm i see what you mean
Mar 27 15:05:38 <rgrunber>	one sec.. i'm not convinced it's acutally gone
Mar 27 15:05:42 <nboldt>	can I use different cache files than /tmp/krb5cc_1000 ?
Mar 27 15:06:30 <jkang|wfh>	klist -A might be useful to see everything
Mar 27 15:06:45 <nboldt>	shows only the most recent ticket
Mar 27 15:06:51 <rgrunber>	^ ++
Mar 27 15:07:02 <nboldt>	same as -a or -f flags
Mar 27 15:08:43 <nboldt>	ah, seems you can use -c to set a different filename :)
Mar 27 15:11:13 <rgrunber>	apparently a known issue ? https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.protocols.kerberos/IjtK9Mo39qc ..
Mar 27 15:13:02 <rgrunber>	from other searches : "The problem is that Kerberos today does not allow you to store credentials for more that one principal in a credentials cache at one time. If you try to add credentials for a second principal to a cache already containing credentials for a principal, the credentials for the first principal will be overwritten."
Mar 27 16:19:34 <nboldt>	rgrunber: yeah, that's from >6 yrs ago
Mar 27 16:19:49 <nboldt>	but I can apparently use two different cache files, so \o/ #solved
Mar 28 02:32:58 <mistria>	scela: hi
Mar 28 02:33:10 <mistria>	scela: ping me when you're ready to have fun on Windows ;)
Mar 28 03:00:21 <scela>	mistria: too early for that now :)
Mar 28 03:01:08 <scela>	mistria: will ping you
Mar 28 05:39:30 <akurtakov>	latest I-build stopped asking for workspace at astartup
Mar 28 05:39:36 <akurtakov>	anyone else seeing it ?
Mar 28 06:25:44 <scela>	mistria: there?
Mar 28 06:26:00 <mistria>	yes
Mar 28 06:26:15 <scela>	mistria: shall we take a look at what i have on win?
Mar 28 06:26:20 <mistria>	akurtakov: didn't try it, but it reminds me of an old issue some time ago
Mar 28 06:26:24 <mistria>	scela: go
Mar 28 06:26:43 <mistria>	scela: do you have a bluejeans URL ?

Mar 28 06:34:14 <akurtakov>	mistria: I see it with platform only
Mar 28 06:34:23 <akurtakov>	can someone try it out ?
Mar 28 06:35:28 <mistria>	akurtakov: I'm downlaoding it, I'll report ASAP
Mar 28 06:35:32 <akurtakov>	thanks
Mar 28 06:35:41 <mistria>	akurtakov: is the preference set to prompt for workspace?
Mar 28 06:35:47 <akurtakov>	mistria: yes
Mar 28 06:38:58 <mistria>	akurtakov: 1h to download the SDK
Mar 28 06:39:03 <akurtakov>	haha
Mar 28 06:39:07 <mistria>	akurtakov: it's Tuesday morning, you know ;)
Mar 28 06:39:14 <akurtakov>	doh
Mar 28 06:39:43 <mistria>	akurtakov: On the bug, Denis said the issue should be fixed
Mar 28 06:44:52 <mistria>	akurtakov: but I think he fails at realizing that millions of Eclipse instances are still asking for updates at the same time
Mar 28 10:24:56 <scela>	mistria: yeah I'm trying many things :)
Mar 28 10:25:02 <scela>	mistria: the open type one got nice traction
Mar 28 10:25:16 <scela>	mistria: let's see how breadcrumb goes
Mar 29 08:26:31 <scela>	akurtakov: i'm going ahead with https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=514397
Mar 29 08:28:53 <akurtakov>	scela: ok
Mar 29 09:25:54 <akurtakov>	scela: how is epp +lucene going ?
Mar 29 09:32:33 <scela>	akurtakov: i fired up my ide with the migrated bundles, waited as mbooth instructed and no exception came up
Mar 29 09:32:40 <akurtakov>	good
Mar 29 09:32:47 <akurtakov>	sending it to gerrit?
Mar 29 09:32:55 <scela>	akurtakov: i filed a bug yesterday to ping the upstream people
Mar 29 09:33:25 <scela>	akurtakov: the thing is that on the client side it's mostly creating tasks (lucene entries)
Mar 29 09:33:40 <akurtakov>	scela: were you in touch with them before for the issue?
Mar 29 09:33:47 <scela>	akurtakov: no
Mar 29 09:33:56 <scela>	akurtakov: depend on what you mean by 'issue'
Mar 29 09:34:13 <scela>	akurtakov: but the point is I have no information on the server side of things
Mar 29 09:34:24 <scela>	akurtakov: and how that would play with a lucene 6 client side of things
Mar 29 09:34:40 <scela>	akurtakov: maybe it would work better if I directly ping marcel
Mar 29 09:34:42 <akurtakov>	ok, let's wait and see :)
Mar 29 09:35:22 <scela>	akurtakov: i could send him an email that I've done the client side of things and see what he thinks
Mar 29 09:39:25 <akurtakov>	scela: please do so
Mar 29 09:39:44 <akurtakov>	we would rather not delay to not miss M7 
Mar 29 09:39:49 <akurtakov>	if possible
Mar 29 09:40:06 <scela>	i see
Mar 29 09:40:13 <scela>	akurtakov: on it now then
Mar 29 09:49:56 <scela>	akurtakov: done
Mar 29 09:50:00 <scela>	akurtakov: will keep you up to date
Mar 29 09:52:03 <scela>	akurtakov: btw, it seems I have an all tests passed on the aCute mvn clean verify on windows 10
Mar 29 09:52:43 <akurtakov>	scela: does it work in the ide ?
Mar 29 09:52:48 <akurtakov>	tests complete for me too
Mar 29 09:52:59 <akurtakov>	but in the browser I don't get autocomplete and etc.
Mar 29 09:53:43 <scela>	akurtakov: did not try. just set it up for mvn clean verify for now as  that's what I was asked :)
Mar 29 09:53:51 <akurtakov>	ok
Mar 29 09:53:53 <scela>	akurtakov: i need to work on some other stuff before I switch again to win
Mar 29 09:53:54 <akurtakov>	I have to run now
Mar 29 09:53:56 <akurtakov>	ttyl
Mar 29 09:53:59 <scela>	ok ttyl
Mar 29 11:00:45 <mbenitez>	PSA: Quarterly Company meeting time
Mar 29 11:01:17 <nboldt1>	PSA 2: mbooth gets 15yr RH Service Award in the video today
Mar 29 11:01:52 <mbenitez>	nboldt1, that's not our mbooth :)
Mar 29 11:02:08 <nboldt1>	damnit. again with the overloaded tech terms
Mar 29 11:02:22 <nboldt1>	*smh*
Mar 29 11:02:30 <mbenitez>	yes, it happens
Mar 29 11:03:10 <nboldt1>	spekaing of, you missed a lively discussion today about developer tools vs. toolset vs. toolkit. :D
Mar 29 11:03:22 <nboldt1>	speaking*
Mar 29 11:03:37 <mbenitez>	too bad! but was fully double booked :(
Mar 29 11:09:25 <mbooth>	nboldt1: Don't think I'm old enough to have 15yrs of service!
Mar 29 11:13:53 <scela>	mistria: so i did a git pull and hard reset on master on aCute and the mvn clean verify seems to work with all tests passed
Mar 29 11:14:10 <mistria>	scela: ok, perfect
Mar 29 11:14:16 <mistria>	scela: thanks for checking!
Mar 29 11:14:22 <scela>	mistria: do you want me to try anything else?
Mar 29 11:27:15 <mistria>	scela: no thanks
Mar 29 11:29:07 <mistria>	scela: did you check the abstract proposal?
Mar 29 11:29:22 <scela>	mistria: i did
Mar 29 11:29:26 <scela>	made some small corrections
Mar 29 11:29:30 <scela>	mistria: lgtm
Mar 30 06:03:22 <dhorak>	mbooth: hi, I've used devel11 from https://platform.lab.eng.brq.redhat.com/dhorak/sec-arch-machines for my local build of eclipse-cdt
Mar 30 06:03:44 <mbooth>	dhorak: Hey
Mar 30 06:05:21 <mbooth>	dhorak: I guess we should try giving maven more memory
Mar 30 06:07:51 <mbooth>	dhorak: I wonder if you can try with a patch like this: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/lhvnWW0U5WHFltY0EPCIuV5M1UNdIGYhyRLivL9gydE=
Mar 30 06:08:20 <dhorak>	mbooth: yup
Mar 30 06:19:19 <dhorak>	mbooth: it's after the org.eclipse.cdt.core build, and still running ...
Mar 30 06:19:30 <mbooth>	\o/
Mar 30 06:22:54 <mbooth>	dhorak: I'll make the change in dist-git
Mar 30 06:24:26 <dhorak>	mbooth: ok
Mar 30 09:40:04 <scela>	mbooth: https://git.eclipse.org/c/epp/org.eclipse.epp.logging.git/commit/?id=e9fcb38b6e4bfa680434ea85298ef1714739e814
Mar 30 09:40:22 <scela>	mbooth: no need to worry anymore for epp and lucene stuff
Mar 30 09:40:52 <scela>	mbooth: includes client/server/download whatever issues
Mar 30 09:41:03 <mbooth>	\o/
Mar 30 09:41:07 <mbooth>	scela: Nice work
Mar 30 09:41:35 <akurtakov>	mbooth: when is the party ? :)
Mar 30 09:46:46 <nboldt>	mbooth: I think I might have a working solution for eclipse-jgit... had to remove one entire patch after a valiant (but failed) attempt to port it to the latest jgit 4.6.1 on jetty 9.4.1
Mar 30 09:47:00 <nboldt>	HOWEVER... I get stuck running your instructions:
Mar 30 09:47:14 <nboldt>	$ fedpkg scratch-build
Mar 30 09:47:23 <nboldt>	Could not execute scratch_build: /home/nboldt/3/eclipse-jgit.rpm has uncommitted changes.  Use git status to see details
Mar 30 09:47:24 <nboldt>	Try option --srpm to make scratch build from local changes.
Mar 30 09:47:27 <nboldt>	so... I then:
Mar 30 09:47:41 <nboldt>	fedpkg scratch-build --srpm
Mar 30 09:47:41 <nboldt>	Wrote: /home/nboldt/3/eclipse-jgit.rpm/eclipse-jgit-4.6.1-1.fc27.src.rpm
Mar 30 09:47:41 <nboldt>	Kerberos authentication fails: Ticket expired
Mar 30 09:47:41 <nboldt>	Could not execute scratch_build: Could not login to https://koji.fedoraproject.org/kojihub
Mar 30 09:47:54 <mbooth>	D'oh
Mar 30 09:48:11 <nboldt>	do I need @REDHAT or @FEDORA kerb ticket active?
Mar 30 09:48:13 <nboldt>	or both?
Mar 30 09:48:33 <mbooth>	nboldt: A Fedora one.
Mar 30 09:49:16 <nboldt>	hmm. looks like my "try to have both tickets active" approach is fail
Mar 30 09:50:07 <nboldt>	ah, there we go. fedpkg only sees the kerb ticket in the default filename
Mar 30 09:50:14 <mbooth>	nboldt: I usually have no problem having both tickets... Output of "klist -A" on my machine is: https://da.gd/wPoG
Mar 30 09:50:25 <mbooth>	I wonder if my config is different
Mar 30 09:50:40 <nboldt>	I'm not using a keyring
Mar 30 09:50:46 <nboldt>	maybe that's the problem
Mar 30 09:54:01 <nboldt>	mbooth: how do you set up the keytab / keyring so you can have more than one key at a time?
Mar 30 09:56:47 <mbooth>	nboldt: TBH I don't recall doing anything specific to support it
Mar 30 09:56:56 <nboldt>	hm
Mar 30 09:57:14 <nboldt>	well, anyway koji is doing something...
Mar 30 09:57:32 <nboldt>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=18682187
Mar 30 09:57:52 <nboldt>	oh, it's done
Mar 30 09:58:24 <nboldt>	so... now I install it and [some kind of smoke test] ?
Mar 30 09:59:54 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yes, you can download the output of a koji task, e.g.: "koji download-task 18682188"
Mar 30 10:01:50 <nboldt>	rather than installing the stuff I built locally?
Mar 30 10:02:14 <mbooth>	nboldt: Ah if you built it locally then sure :-)
Mar 30 10:02:38 <mbooth>	nboldt: For eclipse plugins, I just like to see if the bundles resolve by looking in Eclipse's OSGi console, and for jgit in particular it's worth checking that the jgit command line tool doesn't immediately barf
Mar 30 10:02:40 <nboldt>	isn't that what `fedpkg prep` and `fdpkg mockbuild` do?
Mar 30 10:03:00 <nboldt>	define: barf
Mar 30 10:03:07 <nboldt>	do you have automated barf tests?
Mar 30 10:04:26 <mbooth>	No, but if you something like "jgit daemon /var/lib/git" then there shouldn't be classpath errors
Mar 30 10:05:47 <nboldt>	is there a way to mock install these? or do you install them into your dev machine directly?
Mar 30 10:06:22 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yeah e.g., mock -r ... --install /path/rpm 
Mar 30 10:06:27 <mbooth>	To install into mockroot
Mar 30 10:07:10 <mbooth>	then you can execute commands in the mockroot with, e.g.:
Mar 30 10:07:13 <mbooth>	mock -r fedora-rawhide-x86_64 --shell "ls -l"
Mar 30 10:07:28 <rgrunber>	if you're interested in an automated way.. i remember either Mikolaj or Stanislav created a spec that could test a full eclipse install at runtime.. https://github.com/rgrunber/eclipse-test/blob/master/test.spec ..
Mar 30 10:07:56 <rgrunber>	i added some extra stuff, never found time to get back to it and put it anywhere.
Mar 30 10:09:37 <mbooth>	That's interesting
Mar 30 10:10:21 <rgrunber>	i guess it wasn't that much better than a mock -r $config --shell and run eclipse headless.. since that is the major test case.
Mar 30 10:18:54 <nboldt>	mbooth:

Mar 30 10:21:00 <rgrunber>	platform requires it.. maybe that's why ?..
Mar 30 10:21:05 <nboldt>	mock -r fedora-rawhide-x86_64 --install xz-java
Mar 30 10:21:05 <nboldt>	mock -r fedora-rawhide-x86_64 --shell "jgit daemon /var/lib/git"
Mar 30 10:21:15 <nboldt>	so I should add this dep to eclipse-jgit?
Mar 30 10:21:21 <mbooth>	Hmm, I'm surprised that requires is not auto-generated
Mar 30 10:21:48 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yes jgit should definitely have this dep
Mar 30 10:21:49 *	nboldt makes a shrugging gesture and noise
Mar 30 10:22:04 <nboldt>	in the spec file there's 
Mar 30 10:22:06 <nboldt>	BuildRequires:  xz-java >= 1.1-2
Mar 30 10:22:07 <rgrunber>	mbooth: i think platform has xz-java.. so it falls under the "the platform will do it case".. but jgit is a "library" so can exist outside eclipse ecosystem
Mar 30 10:22:18 <nboldt>	but no Requires
Mar 30 10:22:37 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Yeah, but I thought there'd be a mvn() req generated
Mar 30 10:22:50 <mbooth>	(For jgit the lib, if not eclips-jgit the plugin)
Mar 30 10:23:03 <nboldt>	dunno guys, I'm following your instructions for the first time here :D
Mar 30 10:24:02 <mbooth>	nboldt: In general, maven-built packages should get all the correct deps auto-generated so we don't have to manage Requires in the spec file.... Obviously it's not perfect :-)
Mar 30 10:24:15 <nboldt>	do I add something to the eclipse-jgit.spec or try to find the spec for jgit itself?
Mar 30 10:24:40 <mbooth>	nboldt: Add the req under "%package -n     jgit"
Mar 30 10:24:51 <mbooth>	(jgit is a subpackage from eclipse-jgit)
Mar 30 10:25:42 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Oh wait it must be a transitive dep of commons-compress
Mar 30 10:25:46 <rgrunber>	actually.. does jgit even need.. xz-java ?
Mar 30 10:25:49 <rgrunber>	^^ ye!
Mar 30 10:25:53 <rgrunber>	just grepped sources
Mar 30 10:26:06 <rgrunber>	jgit uses org.apache.commons.compress.compressors.xz.XZCompressorOutputStream
Mar 30 10:26:29 <nboldt>	me is adding "Requires: 		xz-java >= 1.1-2" to eclipse-jgit.spec
Mar 30 10:26:30 <mbooth>	I wonder if it because optional in commons-compress package...
Mar 30 10:26:52 <nboldt>	well, jgit daemon started ok above but ... tossed minor error
Mar 30 10:26:56 <nboldt>	so maybe it IS optional
Mar 30 10:28:35 <nboldt>	so what's the easiest way to share my workinprogress on eclipse-jgit so you can see the changes to patches, sources, and spec file?
Mar 30 10:28:59 <nboldt>	also not sure if I should just remove the jetty 9.4.0 patch since jgit's on 9.4.1 now
Mar 30 10:29:06 <nboldt>	or if I need to modify the patch
Mar 30 10:29:22 <nboldt>	so want to share so someone can review *cough* mbooth */cough*
Mar 30 10:30:41 <nboldt>	can I push it to a broken-as-heck branch instead of rawhide or master or f26 ?
Mar 30 10:30:48 <nboldt>	mbooth: rgrunber: ^
Mar 30 10:31:18 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yes a branch is fine; as I say, there's no formal peer review process in Fedora for package updates
Mar 30 10:31:43 <nboldt>	mbooth: yes but I'm saying a) I don't know how to make fedpkg push to a randomly named branch
Mar 30 10:32:03 <nboldt>	b) I'm not confident in my solution and need a review, be it formal or otherwise
Mar 30 10:32:20 <mbooth>	Plain git works :-)
Mar 30 10:32:29 <rgrunber>	nboldt: bug + patch review i would think is the standard way.
Mar 30 10:33:16 <nboldt>	ok sure but I'm only familiar with the github and gerrit review processes... what's the one for pkgs.fedoraproject.org ?
Mar 30 10:33:36 <nboldt>	that is, what do I type to push my changes into some branch on that server so you can see it?
Mar 30 10:34:34 <nboldt>	do I push to my own fork?
Mar 30 10:36:56 <nboldt>	ugh, I was afraid this would happen... seems I pushed a branch to the origin, https://src.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/eclipse-jgit.git/log/?h=move-to-eclipse-jgit461
Mar 30 10:37:24 <rgrunber>	good to know that's possible :P
Mar 30 10:37:36 <nboldt>	lol, I guess
Mar 30 10:37:41 <nboldt>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/eclipse-jgit.git/diff/?h=move-to-eclipse-jgit461 shows my patch
Mar 30 10:38:31 <nboldt>	are the fedora pacakges mirrored to github? I could fork and work in my own topic branch there instead of cluttering origin (and having to delete topic branches later)
Mar 30 10:38:40 <rgrunber>	nboldt: iirc there really isn't a review server for patches into fedpkg.. it's either attach the patch to a bug or send directly to maintainer.. i guess you could 'clone' and push to github and upload there...
Mar 30 10:38:52 <mbooth>	nboldt: I was gonna suggest that anyway (there's nothing wrong with having dev branches in fedora), or if you don't want to push branches you can pipe the patch into fpaste for a URL to share, or as rgrunber says, attach a patch to a bug
Mar 30 10:39:23 <nboldt>	creating patches seems like the '90s approach when we're in 2017
Mar 30 10:39:25 <mbooth>	Such is life without a formal peer review mechanism
Mar 30 10:39:52 <nboldt>	at least with topic branches you can just pull out my branch to review it locally w/o having to apply a patch by hand or look through pastes
Mar 30 10:40:08 *	nboldt seeks the least clickety-whackedy way to do reviews :D
Mar 30 10:40:08 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yep, be glad we moved away from CVS :-p
Mar 30 10:40:32 <rgrunber>	nboldt: quite living in the present
Mar 30 10:40:34 <rgrunber>	quit*
Mar 30 10:42:07 <rgrunber>	they do have pagure.io.. so reviews are possible that way.. maybe that's the end goal.. eventually get all fedora git repos under there.. ?
Mar 30 10:42:20 <nboldt>	rgrunber: seems like this is the reason for Fedora's "we have no formal review process" mantra: https://i2.wp.com/imgs.xkcd.com/comics/startling.png
Mar 30 10:42:27 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Oh maybe, that would be really good
Mar 30 10:43:11 <mbooth>	nboldt: I'm with dropping the jetty patch if not needed. Can you please check it still also builds on F25?
Mar 30 10:43:30 *	nboldt asks the obvious question "sure, but how?"
Mar 30 10:44:35 <nboldt>	re: dropping the patch ... well since i have no idea what the patch does / why it was applied in jetty 9.4.0 it's difficult to decide if it's useful or not for 9.4.1
Mar 30 10:44:47 <nboldt>	tips on how to make such a decision would be useful here :D
Mar 30 10:45:24 <mbooth>	nboldt: Usually such patches are because of API change
Mar 30 10:45:56 <mbooth>	I happen to know that API changed between jetty 9.3 and 9.4 because I wrote this patch
Mar 30 10:46:41 <nboldt>	aha. so then the patch is possibly obsolete if similar fixes were done after 9.4?
Mar 30 10:46:56 <mbooth>	Yes
Mar 30 10:47:49 <nboldt>	well, it built here. I koji built it and downloaded those rpms. installed into a new mock, and ran the jgit daemon. Saw the above problem. Am rebuilding now to verify I fixed that
Mar 30 10:48:27 <nboldt>	after that I can attempt to koji build it in F25 but I'll need to know the syntax to ask for that
Mar 30 10:49:39 <nboldt>	should I be doing these smoke tests BEFORE fedpkg commit -c && git push ?
Mar 30 10:50:02 <nboldt>	my cheatsheet in progress is here, based on mbooth's original howto: https://gist.github.com/nickboldt/f7b2bdb00c6f2307941fdeaa9065b604
Mar 30 10:50:22 <mbooth>	nboldt: You can specify which target you wish to build for: "fedpkg scratch-build --target f25 --srpm"
Mar 30 10:50:36 <nboldt>	ah, thansk
Mar 30 10:50:38 <nboldt>	thanks*
Mar 30 10:52:11 <nboldt>	so target = rawhide by default, but can specify f25 or f26 too? cool
Mar 30 10:53:28 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yes, I think the default might even be defined by the current branch (where master=rawhide)
Mar 30 10:54:02 <rgrunber>	nboldt: can even specify a particular arch.. with --arch . Tends to be useful to avoid hitting arm on a noarch package when you're totally sure change isn't arch-specific and just want to build faster.
Mar 30 10:54:52 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Good point particularly on F25, where there are no fast aarch64 builder
Mar 30 10:55:30 <rgrunber>	nboldt: for noarch packages, build chooses a builder at random, because as specified it should be able to build on anything.
Mar 30 10:56:25 <akurtakov>	nboldt: looks like you really enjoy Fedora way :)
Mar 30 10:56:44 <akurtakov>	I think I can answer the no formal review
Mar 30 10:57:11 <akurtakov>	usually you have single person dealing with 100+ packages and not vice-versa so the need for it hasn't arised :)
Mar 30 10:57:29 <akurtakov>	aka too few people do things as direct as possible :)
Mar 30 10:57:35 <nboldt>	I'm not looking for a formal approach
Mar 30 10:58:05 <nboldt>	I'm just looking for a way to share my experiments w/ experts so they can nod approval before I push to master and break shit & need to back it out
Mar 30 10:58:23 <nboldt>	pushing to topic branch seems the most simple / benign way
Mar 30 10:58:37 <nboldt>	rgrunber: so I should use --arch noarch ?
Mar 30 10:58:48 <nboldt>	or --arch x86_64 ?
Mar 30 11:01:58 <mbooth>	nboldt: --arch x86_64
Mar 30 11:05:27 <rgrunber>	yup.. --arch is to force building on a machine with that architecture.
Mar 30 11:05:36 <nboldt>	ok, cool. this time xz-java was installed ootb into mock
Mar 30 11:06:11 <nboldt>	so... what other smoke tests should I do on jgit before `fedpkg commit -c` ?
Mar 30 11:07:06 <nboldt>	do we assume that the unit tests cover changes to the patched/not-patched AppServer, so that dropping the patch is safe?
Mar 30 11:07:15 <nboldt>	mbooth: ^
Mar 30 11:08:01 <nboldt>	you said "For eclipse plugins, I just like to see if the bundles resolve by looking in Eclipse's OSGi console, and for jgit in particular it's worth checking that the jgit command line tool doesn't immediately barf"
Mar 30 11:08:20 <nboldt>	so... fire up Eclipse inside the mock and look in console for jgit?
Mar 30 11:10:10 <nboldt>	seems that eclipse-jgit doesn't depend on eclipse being installed either
Mar 30 11:10:15 <nboldt>	so that's ... a thing.
Mar 30 11:11:19 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yes, usually I would do "eclipse -console -consoleLog" and then "ss -s INSTALLED" to print all unresolved bundles

Mar 30 11:12:54 <mbooth>	nboldt: Ah, ignore these jetty errors in rawhide for now, this is something I am working on
Mar 30 11:13:07 <nboldt>	*mutter*
Mar 30 11:13:38 <nboldt>	how do you avoid the SWTError inside mock?
Mar 30 11:13:44 <nboldt>	org.eclipse.swt.SWTError: No more handles [gtk_init_check() failed]
Mar 30 11:13:55 <nboldt>	... and eclipse craps out before I can poke at the ss console
Mar 30 11:16:02 *	nboldt installs jetty ... anything else I need to get mock happy? swt? X? 
Mar 30 11:18:04 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: jjohnstn: please read the latest post to cross -project blaming linuxtools for Neon.3 update failures
Mar 30 11:18:13 <akurtakov>	please react ASAP
Mar 30 11:18:40 <akurtakov>	even if it means respining x.y.z+1 linuxtools and requesting agregation
Mar 30 11:19:15 <mbooth>	nboldt: I've some success running graphical apps in mock using the method detailed here: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingDrafts/Testing#Testing_graphical_packages_with_mock_and_Xnest
Mar 30 11:19:19 <nboldt>	ruh roh :(
Mar 30 11:19:52 <mbooth>	There's probably better ways, but it basically involves setting up an X display for it to use
Mar 30 11:21:52 <jjohnstn>	akurtakov: looking at it
Mar 30 11:35:03 <jjohnstn>	akurtakov: problem was orbit repo was pointing S20161205 which was Oxygen M4 :( ... trying out the recommended Neon.3 repo
Mar 30 11:35:19 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: ^
Mar 30 11:35:42 <rgrunber>	yeah , we should have updated to Oxygen M6 that would have had the fixed httpclient.
Mar 30 11:41:31 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: is that the recommended solution?  I don't know if we can back-pedal to an earlier version...looking at our RC3 release...no http plug-ins are in our repo..but this changes RC4
Mar 30 11:44:23 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: back-pedal? we don't need to though, we can just take the M6 orbit build or the neon.3.
Mar 30 11:44:51 <rgrunber>	yeah we can't downgrade httpclient without taking back docker-client 3.6.8
Mar 30 11:45:03 <nboldt>	mbooth: ok, got Xnest working for xclock and other local things but rawhide mock install of eclipse still crapping out with swt no more handles
Mar 30 11:45:22 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: so we have to take the M6 orbit build...I'll change my patch
Mar 30 11:45:29 <nboldt>	trying again in f25 mock instead as I can't find webkitgtk3 in rawhide 
Mar 30 11:45:44 <mbooth>	nboldt: Weird, did you "export DISPLAY=:1" or whatever number you gave it?
Mar 30 11:45:48 <nboldt>	yes
Mar 30 11:46:02 <nboldt>	from within the mock
Mar 30 11:46:34 <nboldt>	bear in mind I'm running in a virtual machine F24 on host windows 10... so sometimes UI things go awry
Mar 30 11:55:03 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: can you confirm that the M6 version is fixed?
Mar 30 11:55:28 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: yes the M6 version of httpclient contains the missing packages.
Mar 30 12:10:12 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: did the docker client version also go up in M6??  I am seeing errors with compiling docker code
Mar 30 12:11:39 <rgrunber>	yes.. 3.6.8 is still in the repo though.
Mar 30 12:13:32 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: so I need to specify 3.6.8 instead of 0.0.0 in the target file...do I need to explicitly version anything else?
Mar 30 12:14:56 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: you could put an upper limit on 3.6.8 in the docker.core manifest. i don't think it should be necessary since you're unlikely to find 6.1.1 in any of the aggregation repos.. but better to be safe.
Mar 30 12:16:12 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I am getting errors in docker.core regarding com.spotify classes
Mar 30 12:20:20 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: what kind of errors ?
Mar 30 12:27:06 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: missing classes...I guess they obsoleted some spotify classes...trying a build with docker-client version 3.6.8 specified in docker.core MANIFEST
Mar 30 12:28:42 <rgrunber>	thsi shoudl just be a rebuild to pick up an update httpclient by the build.. nothing has changed about the spotify classes themselves.
Mar 30 12:32:40 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: see https://hudson.eclipse.org/linuxtools/job/linuxtools-gerrit/11586/consoleFull
Mar 30 12:33:18 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: i think the build is using 6.1.1
Mar 30 12:33:33 <rgrunber>	in 6.1.1 a lot of the exception classes moved into a separate subpackage.
Mar 30 12:34:18 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: that's what I meant...I tried [3.6.8, 3.6.9) in docker.core MANIFEST.MF  but it can't satisfy this
Mar 30 12:34:43 <rgrunber>	you also need to specify 3.6.8 in the target file.
Mar 30 12:35:03 <rgrunber>	0.0.0 will drag in the latest it can find.
Mar 30 12:36:06 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: trying.....
Mar 30 14:40:42 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: did a build and I have org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient_4.5.2.v20170210-0925.jar and org.apache.httpcomponents.httpcore_4.4.6.v20170210-0925.jar
Mar 30 14:40:50 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: can you confirm those jars are ok?
Mar 30 14:42:28 <rgrunber>	yes, those are correct.
Mar 30 14:47:01 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: ok, I will copy into update, update-docker, update-5.3.1 and update-docker-2.3.1
Mar 30 15:07:56 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: is there anything else I need to worry about being dragged in from the Oxygen M6 repo?  Are all packages CQ'd?  The update and update-docker repos have been updated.
Mar 30 15:08:15 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: if everything is ok, I'll post to the list
Mar 30 15:11:25 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: one sec..
Mar 30 15:13:53 <rgrunber>	it looks like the following have changed :
Mar 30 15:14:25 <rgrunber>	guava 18 -> 21, httpcore 4.4.4 -> 4.4.6, asm 5.1 -> 5.2
Mar 30 15:14:57 <rgrunber>	though we should have uses cqs filed for all of these but wouldn't hurt to check
Mar 30 15:17:07 <rgrunber>	i don't see a cq for guava 21.0.
Mar 30 15:17:13 <rgrunber>	*uses-cq
Mar 30 15:28:18 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I just opened a piggyback CQ for it
Mar 30 15:29:43 <rgrunber>	and httpclient 4.4.6 seems needed..looks like same for the asm 5.2 ones..
Mar 30 15:35:16 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: you mean httpclient 4.5.2 right?
Mar 30 15:37:33 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: done
Mar 30 15:45:00 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: as well, did you see the note from Carsten Reckord?  Can we switch to use the Neon.3 repo which has 3.6.8 and drop the http plugin reqs?
Mar 30 15:57:01 <rgrunber>	k
Mar 30 15:58:46 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: we depend on newer httpclient through docker client 3.6.8 so i don't think we can drop those deps
Mar 30 16:06:01 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: ah, I just noticed that the httpclient and httpcore in Neon.3 orbit repo are the same as we are bringing in anyways
Mar 30 16:12:33 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: I committed a pull request 13 days ago for Docker N&N but to the wrong JBIDE...do I cancel the pull request and create a new branch or can I mention it in the new JBIDE?
Mar 30 16:14:40 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: as long as the code is pushed into the correct repo, the jira number in the commit message isn't as important
Mar 30 16:14:54 <nboldt>	if you want you can edit the commit and fix the msg but *shrug* 
Mar 30 16:15:25 <nboldt>	bigger isssue is the fact that Neon.3 may need a respin?
Mar 30 16:18:31 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: I just put together a 5.3.1 release which is in update and update-docker which uses the Oxygen M6 repos with http fixes...not sure if they will respin Neon.3 in general
Mar 30 16:19:50 <nboldt>	ok, but for devstudio 10.4 we can pick up that new version and include it OOTB instead of making users update ... right?
Mar 30 16:20:05 <nboldt>	we can ==> we should
Mar 30 16:20:44 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: yes...regarding the pull request, I am able to edit the title but the commit remains pushed with the original comment..ok?
Mar 30 16:21:20 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: unless you force-push it back to your fork then yes, the message won't change
Mar 30 16:21:45 <nboldt>	I'm sure jmaury doesn't care what the commit message contains as long as the N&N document itself is accurate
Mar 30 16:22:37 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: will the automation find the pull-request or do I have to manually do something?  I am new to this process as well as pull-requests in general since we use gerrit
Mar 30 16:25:56 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: I'm not sure if the commit messages are used in any way other than to automatically resolve or close JIRAs (assuming you have your email address for JIRA & github set to the same value, and your commit message includes #resolve or #close in it, as noted in these instructions: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-24089
Mar 30 16:28:40 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: I do, but it references the wrong JIRA...the top task instead of the sub-task...does that cause problems or can I just let Jeff know that I specified the wrong JIRA in the commit message?
Mar 30 16:29:16 <nboldt>	I'm sure it's fine. If you don't believe me, ask him. I don't monitor the N&N and don't merge the PRs for them
Mar 30 16:29:22 <nboldt>	https://github.com/jjohnstn/jbosstools-website/blob/18b86da12a5d9f8a4f906664bc77e76fae9710c3/documentation/whatsnew/docker/docker-news-2.3.0.Neon3.sprint129.adoc looks fine
Mar 30 16:29:45 <nboldt>	though to be honest I'm not sure if the FILENAME could be a problem
Mar 30 16:31:22 <nboldt>	can't see any of your N&N content in http://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.4.4.AM1.html or earlier pages
Mar 30 16:31:32 <nboldt>	I see http://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.3.1.Final.html#docker
Mar 30 16:32:21 <nboldt>	last one that appears seems to be https://github.com/jjohnstn/jbosstools-website/blob/18b86da12a5d9f8a4f906664bc77e76fae9710c3/documentation/whatsnew/docker/docker-news-1.2.0.Mars2.adoc --> http://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.3.1.Final.html#docker
Mar 30 16:32:23 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: a N&N wasn't created for Neon.2 stuff as Xavier was handling this before and the ball was dropped when he moved off of Docker Tools
Mar 30 16:33:04 <nboldt>	ok, that explains it. thought maybe there was an issue with filename not being seen by the website yaml magic
Mar 30 16:33:33 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: I take it we can't add one after the fact
Mar 30 16:33:35 <nboldt>	for example I see more forge updates and they all have filenames that match with JBT releases
Mar 30 16:33:38 <nboldt>	https://github.com/jjohnstn/jbosstools-website/tree/18b86da12a5d9f8a4f906664bc77e76fae9710c3/documentation/whatsnew/forge
Mar 30 16:33:41 <nboldt>	sure you can
Mar 30 16:33:47 <nboldt>	you can be all retroactive all you want
Mar 30 16:33:57 <nboldt>	but I can't guarantee people will read it :D
Mar 30 16:45:42 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: just realized you meant a different JIRA when asking about dupe... so yes, the new one I opened is 100% a dupe of the older one
Mar 30 16:45:56 <nboldt>	meanwhile I've opened https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-24173  to ask about the N&N naming problem
Mar 31 10:25:54 <nboldt>	hey jjohnstn does docker tooling have to depend on slf4j 1.7.10 instead of 1.7.2? seems to be causing a conflict in that both versions can't co-exist ... see JBDS-4342
Mar 31 10:48:17 <nboldt>	hey jjohnstn does docker tooling have to depend on slf4j 1.7.10 instead of 1.7.2? seems to be causing a conflict in that both versions can't co-exist ... see JBDS-4342 [resending in case my vpn crashed and this didn't go out]
Mar 31 10:49:03 <rgrunber>	nboldt: no it can use slf4j 1.7.2
Mar 31 10:50:06 <nboldt>	ok... but com.spotify.docker.client 3.6.8.v20161117-2005 requires 'package org.slf4j 1.7.10'
Mar 31 10:50:26 <nboldt>	and org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.feature.feature.group 2.3.0.201703072040 requires com.spotify.docker.client 3.6.8.v20161117-2005
Mar 31 10:50:45 <nboldt>	so... by transitive property, I'm screwed :(
Mar 31 10:52:18 <rgrunber>	there was a fix to it so it would require only 1.7.2. http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops/S20170306214312/repository could you take it from there.. ?
Mar 31 10:52:25 <rgrunber>	*eat least
Mar 31 10:52:26 <rgrunber>	at*
Mar 31 11:06:35 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ah, yes. I could
Mar 31 11:07:31 <nboldt>	rgrunber: why is the "new" orbit site older than the latest R release?
Mar 31 11:07:43 <nboldt>	S20170306214312 vs. R20170307180635
Mar 31 11:08:01 <nboldt>	you fixed something in the 03/06 release S build but not the 03/07 R build?
Mar 31 11:08:50 <rgrunber>	they are slightly different. The S-build had some bundles removed while the R-build retained those but they are based off of the same bundles in orbit-recipes
Mar 31 11:15:52 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ipun: I'm leaving for the weekend, please prepare me a nice surprise for monday :)
Mar 31 11:15:59 <nboldt>	rgrunber: so I want to pull docker.client and slf4j.api from this S build, but take the rest from the R build?
Mar 31 11:16:15 <ipun>	akurtakov: you know it
Mar 31 11:16:18 <ipun>	:)
Mar 31 11:17:18 <nboldt>	rgrunber: um, http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops2/S20170306214312/repository/ only has org.slf4j.api 1.7.10. there's no 1.7.2 in there
Mar 31 11:18:31 <rgrunber>	it wouldn't 1.7.2 exists in the old repository.. but the drops2 you're referencing is one child of the composite which should also reference a repo from 'drops' folder which does contain 1.7.2
Mar 31 11:18:43 <nboldt>	but I see there's a newer docker.client 3.6.8 in there from 2017/02 rather than 2016/11
Mar 31 11:19:01 <nboldt>	oh, ok. 
Mar 31 11:19:58 <nboldt>	mirror failed. trying again. :(

Mar 31 12:04:53 <rgrunber>	nboldt: seems to have succeeded ? let me know if it fixes things..
Mar 31 12:05:46 <nboldt>	woot, thanks. I'll update hte .target files and see what happens now
Mar 31 12:09:36 <nboldt>	rgrunber: seems the old orbit site contains <unit id="com.spotify.docker.client" version="6.1.1.v20170301-1624"/> but iirc docker tools needs 3.6.8
Mar 31 12:10:15 <nboldt>	aaaand jjohnston's offline :(
Mar 31 12:18:52 <rgrunber>	nboldt: old orbit site ? yes 6.1.1 should be in now, but iirc Jeff should have made a fix on the Neon.3 branch to fix this.
Mar 31 12:21:55 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-4278
Mar 31 12:35:32 <nboldt>	well, seems to be provisioning OK so far. I'm just suprised to see a dependency jump between Neon.2 and .3 from 3.6.8 to 6.1.1... that's a lot of changes to API for an update release ;D
Mar 31 12:35:38 <nboldt>	rgrunber: jjohnstn: ^
Mar 31 12:36:16 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: should I be pulling a new version of Docker Tools than was in the Neon.3 site last week?
Mar 31 12:36:24 <nboldt>	if so, URL and feature version please
Mar 31 12:36:50 <rgrunber>	nboldt: 6.1.1 isn't used by our neon.3.. any chance the target platform is just using 0.0.0 or something and getting latest ?
Mar 31 12:37:07 <nboldt>	it's using whatever it found in the S20170306 orbit site
Mar 31 12:37:17 <nboldt>	should I force it to an older version?
Mar 31 12:37:22 <rgrunber>	yes
Mar 31 12:37:39 <nboldt>	back to 3.6.8 then?
Mar 31 12:37:57 <nboldt>	com.spotify.docker.client	3.6.8.v20170223-1848 instead of old version com.spotify.docker.client	3.6.8.v20161117-2005 ?
Mar 31 12:38:17 <nboldt>	rgrunber: ^
Mar 31 12:38:18 <rgrunber>	nboldt: yes
Mar 31 12:38:23 <nboldt>	ok thanks
Mar 31 12:40:22 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: I have updated Linux Tools with a point release (5.3.1)...downloads/linuxtools/update-docker-2.3.1 contains the latest and matches downloads/linuxtools/update-docker
Mar 31 12:41:17 <nboldt>	ok... so next problem...
Mar 31 12:41:37 <nboldt>	org.slf4j.impl.log4j12 1.7.2 is dragging in slf4j.api 1.7.2 even if I ask for 1.7.10 in the TP
Mar 31 12:41:49 *	nboldt doesn't know whta reqiures org.slf4j.impl.log4j12 though
Mar 31 12:41:52 <nboldt>	what*
Mar 31 12:47:04 <rgrunber>	nboldt: can you just not have 1.7.10 in the TP ? it shouldn't be needed by docker tooling any longer...
Mar 31 12:47:19 <nboldt>	rgrunber: hmm. that could work
Mar 31 12:47:32 <nboldt>	meanwhile http://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools/update-docker/ is Service Unavailable'd
Mar 31 13:11:48 <nboldt>	jjohnstn|lunch: you sure about that URL? I can't see it on http and build.eclipse.org is refusing to let me in on ssh... timing out
Mar 31 13:13:10 <nboldt>	oh, managed to resolve http://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools/update-docker-2.3.1/features/?d :D
Mar 31 15:00:21 <nboldt>	rgrunber: dumb question
Mar 31 15:00:27 <nboldt>	$➔ fedpkg new-sources egit-4.6.1.201703071140-r.tar.xz 
Mar 31 15:00:27 <nboldt>	Could not execute new_sources: Request is unauthorized.
Mar 31 15:04:06 <nboldt>	ah, kerberos problem. nm, fixed
Mar 31 15:42:58 <rgrunber>	:)
Mar 31 15:44:56 <nboldt>	rgrunber: so... trying to koji scratch build eclipse-egit 4.6.1 (which depends on eclipse-jgit 4.6.1)
Mar 31 15:45:18 <nboldt>	and it keeps failing because it can't resolve eclipse-jgit 4.6.1 ... how do I get around that ?
Mar 31 15:45:18 <rgrunber>	ah.. you can do a chain build for that one sec..
Mar 31 15:46:08 <rgrunber>	hmm might not be possible to chain scratch builds..
Mar 31 15:46:33 <nboldt>	*grumble*
Mar 31 15:46:50 <nboldt>	so I submit the topic branch and you review and merge to master?
Mar 31 15:47:02 <nboldt>	you being you or mbooth or someone ?
Mar 31 15:47:13 <rgrunber>	nboldt: you could build locally in mock to confirm it would likely work.
Mar 31 15:47:20 <nboldt>	did that
Mar 31 15:47:41 <nboldt>	and it worked
Mar 31 15:48:01 <nboldt>	but didn't try installing it as that step is supposed to come after koji scratch build (according to mbooth's HOWTO)
Mar 31 15:48:11 <nboldt>	but I guess I can use the local bits instead
Mar 31 15:49:43 <rgrunber>	nboldt: was mbooth fine with you just creating a topic branch on the repo ?
Mar 31 15:49:55 <nboldt>	kinda but seems I can't delete them later
Mar 31 15:50:11 <nboldt>	so the alternative is... dump a patch into fpaste ?
Mar 31 15:50:22 <rgrunber>	yeah.. sounds fine.
Mar 31 15:50:24 <nboldt>	ok
Mar 31 15:51:50 <nboldt>	ugh. so colourless and 1990s. https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/eF71a8gR9SpHPkVtH4xbCF5M1UNdIGYhyRLivL9gydE=

Apr 03 12:32:19 <nboldt>	I can't recall if I ever had commit rights on that project but I've definitely helped Bob w/ builds in the past... and updating license files and other metadata kinda falls into "build guy" territory as I'm periodically the guy who notices that copyright dates are expired (dev and QE rarely notice)

Apr 03 12:52:47 <mbooth>	nboldt: Would you like to update eclipse-pydev?
Apr 03 12:53:03 <nboldt>	mbooth: could try sure
Apr 03 12:53:09 <mbooth>	Awesome, thanks
Apr 03 12:53:56 <nboldt>	gotta say, after years of being beaten for doing so, it's weird gong back to working without an issue tracker number. :)
Apr 03 12:54:01 <nboldt>	going*
Apr 03 13:02:45 <mbooth>	nboldt: There is a system that will file bugs when new releases of upstream projects are released, but I don't seem to be able to turn it on eclipse-pydev
Apr 03 13:03:14 <mbooth>	Maybe only akurtakov can do it, since he is the administrative contact for this package
Apr 03 13:04:02 <mbooth>	nboldt: Feel free to file your own bugs though if you'd like the additional bureaucracy ;-)
Apr 03 13:04:54 <nboldt>	mbooth: nah, every time I look at bugzilla a die a little inside
Apr 03 13:05:51 <nboldt>	rgrunber: apparently pleacu is being handed the controls for bpel/bpmn stuff. but doesn't have rights yet
Apr 03 13:06:50 <rgrunber>	i c
Apr 04 07:05:03 <scela>	mistria: the gerrit seems ok
Apr 04 07:05:22 <scela>	mistria: i'll make some further tests and +1 it
Apr 04 07:05:24 <scela>	mistria: btw, how do you feel about the word completion?
Apr 04 07:06:05 <mistria>	scela: it's nice, but I have to admit it's not something that I feel as "good" in an IDE
Apr 04 07:06:15 <mistria>	scela: what I mean is that if I get this, I'm disappointed
Apr 04 07:06:26 <mistria>	scela: it's better than nothing, but not much IMHO
Apr 04 07:07:02 <mistria>	scela: but it's definitely something nice to have as fall-back
Apr 04 07:07:25 <mistria>	scela: many languages are ad-hoc (such as properties), and in this case, this does help
Apr 04 07:11:18 <scela>	mistria: yeah always nicer to get ad-hoc completion for a given content-type
Apr 04 07:11:39 <scela>	mistria: and if it isn't there this looks as a sort of half-baked attempt at it
Apr 04 07:11:50 <scela>	mistria: but still it is better than nothing I think
Apr 04 07:12:01 <mistria>	scela: of course
Apr 04 07:16:58 <mistria>	scela: is there somewhere where I could already report feature request for the WordCompletion?
Apr 04 07:20:06 <scela>	mistria: there is already a bug for it yes
Apr 04 07:20:22 <scela>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=514397
Apr 04 07:21:40 <scela>	mistria: i reviewed the gerrit
Apr 04 07:21:55 <scela>	mistria: if you've already made sure it doesn't break other stuff I'd merge it
Apr 04 07:23:18 <mistria>	scela: I'm using it right now while testing word processor and working on web-based LS, and the tests seem to be working. So AFAIK, it shouldn't break anything.
Apr 04 07:23:45 <mistria>	scela: moreover, the code change isn't much impacting the "outside" and seems like a real bugfix
Apr 04 07:28:04 <scela>	mistria: ok
Apr 04 07:28:18 <scela>	mistria: i don't get what you mean in the bug comment
Apr 04 07:28:34 <scela>	mistria: if you have ec^ and there is an 'eclipse' proposal
Apr 04 07:28:50 <scela>	mistria: the completion will stay there if you type l then i etc.
Apr 04 07:28:53 <scela>	mistria: is this what you mean?
Apr 04 07:29:19 <mistria>	scela: ok, I was looking at the code you gave me for testing, maybe this changes
Apr 04 07:29:49 <mistria>	scela: I've been mixing the LSP completion and word completion and the popup was hidden on type
Apr 04 07:31:13 <mistria>	scela: completionProposalPopup, it went to line 1534 and then stopped the completion session
Apr 04 07:32:40 <mistria>	scela: it's probably more an issue on my side though
Apr 04 07:33:03 <mistria>	scela: but anyway, if you can implement the ICompletionProposalExtensionX interfaces, it usually gives nicer results
Apr 04 07:33:07 <scela>	they are not supposed to be mixed
Apr 04 07:33:21 <mistria>	scela: finer filtering without re-parsing the file, highlight matching strings...
Apr 04 07:33:44 <scela>	mistria: i'll put a condition similar to 'if no other processor is registered, register this one'
Apr 04 07:34:07 <scela>	mistria: it's not a good idea to have the word processor alongside other processors
Apr 04 07:44:17 <mistria>	scela: I think it's better to be ready for having it mixed with others
Apr 04 07:44:43 <mistria>	scela: just in case some people want to reuse it (with some filters), or if we happen to have another good idea of another default processor
Apr 04 07:51:40 <scela>	mistria: i think it's wrong to enable it everywhere. in a big diverse file the number of proposals would be quite big, and probably hide the best ones
Apr 04 07:52:03 <scela>	akurtakov: any opinion on ^
Apr 04 07:52:04 <scela>	?
Apr 04 07:52:15 <scela>	technically is really easy to change anyway
Apr 04 07:52:32 <scela>	so if in the future we have a bright idea we can refine it
Apr 04 07:54:40 <akurtakov>	scela: to have wordcompletion always on ?
Apr 04 07:58:20 <scela>	akurtakov: i guess that's what mistria means by 'having it mixed with others'
Apr 04 07:58:25 <scela>	akurtakov: or maybe i misread it
Apr 04 07:58:42 <scela>	akurtakov: so say we have word completion also on TP editor
Apr 04 07:59:00 <scela>	akurtakov: and this would be 'mixed' i guess
Apr 04 08:17:46 <mistria>	scela: anyway, please just make the proposals implement the ICompletionProposalExtension2 interface, it will save CPU cycles by filtering rather than recomputing
Apr 04 08:18:51 <mistria>	scela: and if it happens to be mixed with other proposals at some time (for any good or bad reason), it would improve the state
Apr 04 08:28:12 <scela>	mistria: ok. you're worried about the validate method right?
Apr 04 08:28:48 <mistria>	scela: yes, with the snippet you gave me earlier, this method is not honored because the proposals aren't implementing the right interface
Apr 04 08:29:15 <mistria>	scela: so it ends up reparsing the file on every keystroke
Apr 04 08:29:40 <mistria>	scela: with a proper validate and the right interface, it reuses computed proposals when possible
Apr 04 08:42:20 <scela>	mistria: i was using the default CompletionProposal class, rather than defining my own and extending more interfaces that's why
Apr 04 08:43:27 <mistria>	scela: What would be great would be to have this class implement the various extensions
Apr 04 08:43:35 <mistria>	scela: so some nice features would be on by default
Apr 04 08:44:58 <scela>	mistria: that's a must if I want to respect the ICompletionProposalExtension2 contract
Apr 04 08:45:45 <mistria>	scela: can't you create your own subtype of completionProposal ?
Apr 04 08:46:36 <scela>	mistria: CP is final
Apr 04 08:46:49 <mistria>	scela: damn
Apr 04 08:47:18 <mistria>	scela: you can still copy it... but that really sucks
Apr 04 08:47:20 <scela>	mistria: so I'd have to go from implementing ICP from scratch
Apr 04 08:47:28 <scela>	mistria: indeed
Apr 04 08:47:46 <mistria>	scela: but I don't think we're still allowed to add interfaces to CompletionPropsal. Are we?
Apr 04 08:48:14 <scela>	mistria: CP is API no?
Apr 04 08:48:20 <scela>	mistria: i think we're too late for that
Apr 04 08:48:23 <mistria>	scela: yes, I think so
Apr 04 08:50:21 <mistria>	scela: actually, if it's final, it's not that a breaking change to add an interface...
Apr 04 08:50:38 <mistria>	scela: it's indeed a change, but not a too risky one
Apr 04 08:58:52 <scela>	mistria: still qualifies as a change though and it would require quite some testing if we were to merge at this time
Apr 04 08:59:00 <scela>	mistria: time which frankly i don't want to spend on this topic
Apr 04 10:14:48 <akurtakov>	ipun: here?
Apr 04 10:15:06 <ipun>	akurtakov: hey alex, read your email
Apr 04 10:15:27 <akurtakov>	so can you revert only StyledText ?
Apr 04 10:17:18 <ipun>	akurtakov: trying to, says the cotributor must "sign off"
Apr 04 10:18:00 <akurtakov>	ipun: wait
Apr 04 10:18:28 <akurtakov>	ipun: I mean if you revert only StyledText change
Apr 04 10:18:41 <akurtakov>	how broken would that leave it with the gesture patch landed in
Apr 04 10:19:29 <akurtakov>	I remember it was a prereq
Apr 04 10:19:55 <akurtakov>	so if we revert StyledText only and keep the dnd patch in will it mean styledtext will be totally broken ?
Apr 04 10:20:13 <ipun>	akurtakov: i don't believe the gesture patch has to do with the styledText, it was just for the main DnD
Apr 04 10:20:29 <ipun>	akurtakov: styledtext wouldnt be totally broken...just dnd would not work correctly
Apr 04 10:20:44 <akurtakov>	on both x11 and wayland?
Apr 04 10:21:26 <ipun>	i believe only wayland
Apr 04 10:21:38 <ipun>	i would have to test, i forgot the state of it before
Apr 04 10:21:48 <akurtakov>	ipun: please revert locally and try it
Apr 04 10:22:07 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ^ 
Apr 04 10:22:15 <lufimtse>	hey
Apr 04 10:22:41 <akurtakov>	ipun: lufimtse: can we do the instanceof + !isX11 in gtk specific classes to change implementation for wayland only?
Apr 04 10:24:54 <lufimtse>	hmm
Apr 04 10:25:50 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, will disscuss with Ian.
Apr 04 10:26:19 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ipun: note that I'm looking for a solution that doens't change anything for x11
Apr 04 10:27:25 <akurtakov>	let's discuss it again in an hour? ok?
Apr 04 10:42:05 <ipun>	akurtakov: okay
Apr 04 10:48:14 <ipun>	akurtakov, lufimtse it doesnt look like reverting that patch will fix it. Of anything it breaks styledtext further for x11/wayland
Apr 04 10:48:40 <akurtakov>	ipun: so we will go big revert 
Apr 04 10:48:46 <akurtakov>	styledtext + dnd patch
Apr 04 10:48:50 <akurtakov>	java parts only
Apr 04 10:49:23 <akurtakov>	ipun: aka revert to state where x11 works
Apr 04 10:49:36 <akurtakov>	and figure new way for wayland if needed
Apr 04 10:53:41 <akurtakov>	ipun: ok ?^
Apr 04 10:55:17 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: sprint demo session in ~5min
Apr 04 10:55:30 <mbenitez>	with our own Jeff starring
Apr 04 10:55:48 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: are we going to be last ?
Apr 04 10:56:02 <akurtakov>	I have pmc meeting at same time but will join after that
Apr 04 10:56:07 <mbenitez>	https://redhat.bluejeans.com/6300487397
Apr 04 10:56:23 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, I think so, at least after the Che demos
Apr 04 10:56:29 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 04 10:56:33 <akurtakov>	so I should be in time
Apr 04 10:57:00 <mbenitez>	sounds good
Apr 04 10:59:02 <ipun>	akurtakov: yup
Apr 04 10:59:24 <ipun>	in that case, we really need to push forward with a IS_WAYLAND call
Apr 04 10:59:37 <ipun>	i forgot about what we discussed about why it wasnt feasible...
Apr 04 11:00:13 <akurtakov>	ipun: no we will use !IS_X11
Apr 04 11:01:01 <ipun>	akurtakov: ah okay
Apr 04 11:01:28 <akurtakov>	ipun: in order to have proper IS_WAYLAND we need wayland backend compiled in and this is not the case on rhel 7
Apr 04 11:03:44 <nboldt>	mbooth: dumb question... how can you make a patch ignore line endings so it doesn't fail to apply? Or, how do you make the patch itself updated to match the line endings of the source file? Seems someone changed the line endings of plugins/org.python.pydev.debug/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF so now the simple one line change won't apply
Apr 04 11:06:02 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: would you please take care of prepping single revert of the java parts only
Apr 04 11:06:08 <akurtakov>	without OS.java
Apr 04 11:06:15 <akurtakov>	for both commits
Apr 04 11:06:20 <lufimtse>	akurtakov,  for the dnd patch?
Apr 04 11:06:58 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, btw
Apr 04 11:07:03 <lufimtse>	is_wayland
Apr 04 11:07:15 <lufimtse>	we could write a bit of custom code, that tries to call the function dynamically
Apr 04 11:07:27 <lufimtse>	if function pointer fails to load, it means wayland not installed.
Apr 04 11:07:32 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: NO, we go safe this time
Apr 04 11:07:47 <lufimtse>	meaning we could try later?
Apr 04 11:08:11 <lufimtse>	or stick to !is_x11?
Apr 04 11:08:35 <akurtakov>	for now we stik to !is_x11
Apr 04 11:08:42 <lufimtse>	ok.
Apr 04 11:08:55 <akurtakov>	until we build on platform with wayland backend compiled in
Apr 04 11:22:47 <mbenitez>	REMINDER: please fill in your goals for the sprint http://eclipse.etherpad.corp.redhat.com/sprint-planning
Apr 04 11:24:05 <mbenitez>	ipun, mbooth, mistria, scela, ^
Apr 04 12:01:04 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ipun: so reverting StyledText changes 
Apr 04 12:01:19 <akurtakov>	and changing all the other dnd changes to if !x11
Apr 04 12:01:30 <akurtakov>	we should be in a state where x11 is fine 
Apr 04 12:01:46 <akurtakov>	and StyledText is broken under wayland 
Apr 04 12:01:57 <akurtakov>	?
Apr 04 12:06:02 <ipun>	akurtakov: ill have leo test it as we ll
Apr 04 12:13:32 <patrickm>	jjohnstn: how is the LLVM/Clang support in the eclipse desktop?
Apr 04 12:15:03 <jjohnstn>	patrickm: haven't played with it...in theory it should just be the toolchain so everything else should just work
Apr 04 12:17:04 <patrickm>	jjohnstn: ok, with Clang + LLDB support on the horizon, we may need to dig a little deeper 
Apr 04 12:18:08 <jjohnstn>	understood
Apr 04 12:22:48 <akurtakov>	patrickm: what is the priority of this work ?
Apr 04 12:23:07 <akurtakov>	and how deep we should go 
Apr 04 12:23:43 <patrickm>	akurtakov: we're looking at providing a tech preview of LLVM/LLDB in a DTS-like offering in the fall 
Apr 04 12:25:42 <patrickm>	akurtakov: we'll need to sit down and see where this work is priority wise with all the other work
Apr 04 12:26:16 <patrickm>	where "we" == you / jeff / mbenitez 
Apr 04 12:26:48 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 04 12:32:52 <patrickm>	akurtakov: just add it to the list ;)
Apr 04 13:02:26 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: ipun: should we push the patch?
Apr 04 13:02:34 <akurtakov>	my test shows it's fine
Apr 04 13:03:04 <akurtakov>	ipun: please update it pointing to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=510446
Apr 04 13:46:13 <akurtakov>	ipun: lufimtse: if I'm not around when you get back, please merge the patch today an
Apr 04 13:47:34 <akurtakov>	d hangle bzs properly
Apr 04 14:30:59 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, sec...
Apr 04 14:31:07 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, we're thinking...
Apr 04 14:31:51 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, it seems that some event is lost and a state flag is not being set, which is causing the breakage. We're looking for a flag-less solution or why flags are not returned.
Apr 04 14:50:14 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: for today?
Apr 04 15:03:57 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, we're working on it. When's the dead-line?
Apr 04 15:04:28 <akurtakov>	well, I would like to see x11 fixed tomorrow
Apr 04 15:04:48 <lufimtse>	Is it ok to break wayland?
Apr 04 15:04:48 <akurtakov>	or at least comment on the bug with clear timeline for deliveing the fix
Apr 04 15:04:54 <akurtakov>	not more than 1-2 days
Apr 04 15:05:38 <lufimtse>	The styled text is somewhat delicate, if we revert the patch wayland's Styled text will break from what I gather,
Apr 04 15:05:44 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: not in general but styledtext dnd on wayland could be left for next round
Apr 04 15:05:54 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 04 15:06:18 <lufimtse>	We'll try to get something in today, if not we'll set expectations, latest in 1-2 days the styled changes will be undone.
Apr 04 15:06:29 <lufimtse>	would that work?
Apr 04 15:07:34 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok, I'm moving my laptop to Ian's desktop. I may lose irc as I don't have vpn setup. Feel free to ping Ian, I'll be near his desk.

Apr 05 09:57:37 <scela>	nboldt: yeah some editors try to get smart and fix line endings > git doesn't like it
Apr 05 09:58:55 <nboldt>	well, I have   autocrlf = input in my ~/.gitconfig so it should be respectin' my authoritah 
Apr 05 09:59:18 <nboldt>	... though much like Cartman in police attire... it's not :(
Apr 05 09:59:57 <scela>	nboldt: so basically while changing from 5.5 to 5.6 you removed ^M in the process?
Apr 05 10:00:10 <scela>	can't you just vim in and just change the 5->6?
Apr 05 10:01:54 <mbooth>	It's $current_year, why are line endings still a thing that we have to think about? :-(
Apr 05 10:08:18 <nboldt>	scela: vim messed it up too. I went with sed inplace replacement :D
Apr 05 10:08:40 <nboldt>	mbooth: Because there's still no linux on the desktop :)
Apr 05 10:09:20 <nboldt>	\o/ fedpkg prep exited with 0 (finally)
Apr 05 10:09:37 <mbooth>	nboldt: It's the great irony of Linux, that it is everywhere *except* the desktop :-p
Apr 05 10:10:04 <nboldt>	mbooth: note: to make prep pass I had to install more java dep rpms packages. Should those be added to the spec file?
Apr 05 10:10:23 <nboldt>	# dnf install antlr32-java.noarch jnr-netdb.noarch jython.noarch netty
Apr 05 10:11:06 <nboldt>	eg., as BuildRequires?
Apr 05 10:11:10 <mbooth>	Only if it fails in mock, IIRC these are pulled in transitively by jython
Apr 05 10:11:36 <nboldt>	it just fails in `fedpkg prep` unless I install them
Apr 05 10:12:14 <mbooth>	nboldt: Right, but BRs are not processed for fedpkg prep
Apr 05 10:12:22 <nboldt>	ah ok
Apr 05 10:12:52 <nboldt>	feh. mockbuild failed .... compilation errors
Apr 05 10:38:01 <nboldt>	mbooth: so riddle me this. The 5.6 pydev sources, patched, compile fine by hand with maven. But they crap out due to compile failure inside a mockbuild?
Apr 05 10:38:49 <mbooth>	nboldt: What is the error?
Apr 05 10:39:26 <mbooth>	Pastebin the log: $ fpaste /var/lib/mock/fedora-rawhide-x86_64/result/build.log

Apr 05 18:35:42 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: that will have to be a question for rgrunberg...I used the M6 build which is the one he said had the fix
Apr 06 04:46:14 <akurtakov>	mbooth: here ?

Apr 06 04:48:49 <akurtakov>	mbooth: can you sneak one more rebuild ?
Apr 06 04:51:08 <mbooth>	akurtakov: I'll see what I can do
Apr 06 04:51:14 <akurtakov>	mbooth: thanks
Apr 06 04:51:43 <akurtakov>	not seeing debug console by default is a major issue IMHO
Apr 06 04:52:32 <akurtakov>	sorry for not replying earlier but I managed to get to it just this morning
Apr 06 04:53:36 <mbooth>	scela, akurtakov: How does Eclipse look in Ubuntu's Unity these days? Looks like it's going away: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/04/ubuntu-18-04-ship-gnome-desktop-not-unity
Apr 06 04:53:48 <akurtakov>	mbooth: ugly :)
Apr 06 04:54:16 <mbooth>	So that's one less problem then :-)
Apr 06 05:01:57 <akurtakov>	mbooth: definetely
Apr 06 05:07:23 <akurtakov>	mbooth: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=466515 :)
Apr 06 05:07:42 <akurtakov>	and prefer-dark-theme setting being noop is enough said
Apr 06 05:10:48 <akurtakov>	mbooth: ruby patch is in master now
Apr 06 05:14:18 <akurtakov>	next - Ian's patch :)
Apr 06 05:24:03 <akurtakov>	I get timeout for git pull from eclipse.org?
Apr 06 05:24:14 <akurtakov>	scela: mistria: ^ works for you
Apr 06 05:25:04 <mistria>	akurtaov: works from Gerrit URLs 
Apr 06 05:25:50 <akurtakov>	yeah, but what about committer ssh urls
Apr 06 05:47:14 <akurtakov>	mistria: scela: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/I20170405-2000/testresults/html/org.eclipse.ui.genericeditor.tests_ep47I-unit-cen64-gtk3_linux.gtk.x86_64_8.0.html
Apr 06 05:47:31 <akurtakov>	related to yesterday code ?
Apr 06 05:48:01 <mistria>	akurtakov scela: tests passed on Gerrit...
Apr 06 05:48:20 <mistria>	akurtakov: we often have the case of tests ok on Gerrit and failing on actual build with this tests
Apr 06 05:48:31 <mistria>	akurtakov: it's a bit annoying
Apr 06 05:48:41 <mistria>	akurtakov: we need to reinvestigate everytime...
Apr 06 05:48:54 <akurtakov>	yeah, obviously tests are not really stable
Apr 06 06:08:42 <akurtakov>	mbooth: btw, bluejeans works with firefox again on f26 :)
Apr 06 06:11:22 <scela>	akurtakov: we usually wait for the next build to make sure it's not a temp thing
Apr 06 06:11:33 <scela>	akurtakov: very difficult to reproduce those
Apr 06 06:14:54 <akurtakov>	scela: can't the tests be enhanced to provide some more data on failure so some guess what goes wrong could happen?
Apr 06 06:15:00 <mistria>	akurtakov: did you have the opportunity to try sharing the whole desktop on Hangout?
Apr 06 06:15:26 <akurtakov>	google hangout ?
Apr 06 06:19:08 <akurtakov>	mistria: I can try with you if interested
Apr 06 06:19:23 <mistria>	akurtakov: ok
Apr 06 06:20:04 <mistria>	akurtakov: feel free to ping me at mickael.istria@gmail.com
Apr 06 07:22:25 <akurtakov>	scela: btw, really nice on the default completion
Apr 06 07:24:08 <akurtakov>	scela: maybe you should exclude 1 letter long proposals
Apr 06 07:24:39 <akurtakov>	it's weird to see a/1/2 and similar
Apr 06 07:35:52 <scela>	akurtakov: indeed
Apr 06 07:36:00 <scela>	akurtakov: on it now
Apr 06 07:36:27 <scela>	akurtakov: how does it look in general the usecases you thought of originally?
Apr 06 07:36:35 <akurtakov>	quite good
Apr 06 07:36:41 <akurtakov>	making use of it already
Apr 06 07:37:13 <scela>	akurtakov: good to know
Apr 06 07:38:00 <scela>	akurtakov: it works on any kind of file, unless another processor is registered
Apr 06 07:41:48 <akurtakov>	yeah, I advertized it in twitter already
Apr 06 07:46:13 <scela>	akurtakov: can you try to create a new eclipse launch config with latest i-build?
Apr 06 07:46:24 <scela>	akurtakov: either via double-click or right-click->new
Apr 06 07:46:28 <scela>	akurtakov: it breaks for me
Apr 06 07:46:29 <akurtakov>	yes, already created few
Apr 06 07:46:36 <akurtakov>	what's wrong for you
Apr 06 07:47:43 <scela>	akurtakov: can you try this, delete all launch configs and click one project in ws
Apr 06 07:47:55 <scela>	akurtakov: then click the run button (even though there are no launch configs)
Apr 06 07:48:06 <scela>	akurtakov: after that try to create a new launch config
Apr 06 07:48:12 <scela>	akurtakov: does it work for you?
Apr 06 07:49:54 <akurtakov>	scela: failed
Apr 06 07:50:02 <akurtakov>	Cannot create file ...
Apr 06 08:04:37 <scela>	akurtakov: indeed
Apr 06 08:11:09 <akurtakov>	scela: probably http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.resources.git/commit/?id=607937d3eeafb995b5d9711e21683dc4934e0a96
Apr 06 08:16:48 <scela>	akurtakov: ok
Apr 06 08:16:54 <scela>	i'll comment there with steps to reproduce
Apr 06 08:34:21 <scela>	akurtakov: done
Apr 06 09:53:47 <akurtakov>	btw, I still can't pull from eclipse.org anyone else noticing it ?
Apr 06 10:08:49 <scela>	akurtakov: works for me
Apr 06 10:09:06 <akurtakov>	hmm, I wonder what's wrong on my side
Apr 06 10:09:32 <scela>	akurtakov: what protocol are you trying to pull with
Apr 06 10:09:33 <scela>	?
Apr 06 10:09:37 <akurtakov>	ssh
Apr 06 10:09:51 <scela>	akurtakov: tried https? or git?
Apr 06 10:10:04 <akurtakov>	no, I don't want to reconfigure all my remotes
Apr 06 10:10:47 <scela>	akurtakov: what's the error?
Apr 06 10:11:01 <akurtakov>	time out
Apr 06 10:11:17 <scela>	what repo?
Apr 06 10:11:23 <scela>	all repos?
Apr 06 10:11:40 <scela>	akurtakov: ^
Apr 06 10:11:47 <akurtakov>	yes
Apr 06 10:13:42 <scela>	akurtakov: how about through gerrit?
Apr 06 10:13:43 <mistria>	akurtakov: Patrick will remain working on TraceCompass and SWTBot
Apr 06 10:19:12 <scela>	akurtakov: once my ip got banned for some strange traffic reason. dennis took care of it at that time.
Apr 06 10:19:32 <scela>	akurtakov: so if it doesn't fix itself and everyone else can pull, might be worth checking
Apr 06 10:19:40 <akurtakov>	what have you done ?
Apr 06 10:19:53 <scela>	akurtakov: wdym?
Apr 06 10:20:01 <akurtakov>	to get it unblocked
Apr 06 10:20:22 <scela>	akurtakov: ask dennis that I (ssh username) can't pull/push
Apr 06 10:20:33 <scela>	akurtakov: want me to ask him for you? dennis roy
Apr 06 10:20:41 <scela>	webmaster@eclipse.org might be best
Apr 06 10:20:44 <scela>	as matt can also do it
Apr 06 10:20:52 <akurtakov>	nah, I wondered about some procedure for that
Apr 06 10:21:09 <scela>	akurtakov: no it's not automated
Apr 06 10:21:42 <scela>	akurtakov: if it persists just check it out with webmaster i guess
Apr 06 10:48:09 <akurtakov>	scela: you were right it was network block
Apr 06 10:48:48 <scela>	akurtakov: cool
Apr 06 10:49:03 <scela>	akurtakov: i guess you're pushing so often you're starting to look like spam ;)
Apr 06 10:49:23 <akurtakov>	haha, I'll take that as compliment
Apr 06 10:49:40 <akurtakov>	for the sake of truth I quite often start paralel pulls :)
Apr 06 10:50:44 <scela>	akurtakov: yeah it's quite a handy feature in egit to do the multiple pull
Apr 06 10:52:42 <scela>	nboldt: how did the lucene patch story go?
Apr 06 10:57:26 <nboldt>	scela: worked until I pushed it to github... then git changed the line endings and it broke in koji
Apr 06 10:58:04 <scela>	nboldt: hm ok
Apr 06 10:58:35 <scela>	nboldt: why did you push it to github anyway?
Apr 06 11:00:29 <nboldt>	because it worked locally
Apr 06 11:00:43 <nboldt>	and because mbooth has said "we can fix things if they're broken in master" 
Apr 06 11:00:53 <nboldt>	rather than "we should use gerrit reviews or PRs" :D
Apr 06 11:05:08 <mbooth>	nboldt: Ah, it's a case of the file being patched has windows line endings but the patch itself was generated on linux, so the diff header has \n and the content has \r\n..? Maybe upstream would take a patch to rationalise line-endings in their project....
Apr 06 11:06:56 <nboldt>	mbooth: perhaps. the patch from scela - https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/fabioz/Pydev/pull/196.diff - has a mix of line endings
Apr 06 11:07:21 <nboldt>	so the manifest.mf part is hard to apply
Apr 06 11:09:03 <mbooth>	Yes, I see the "^M"s in vim for the MANIFEST.MF portion of the patch
Apr 06 11:12:54 <mbooth>	I guess I never encountered this as a problem because I don't use git's autocrlf feature. It's totally reasonable to want a patch that touches files with different line endings
Apr 06 11:13:42 <mbooth>	Although, I still consider it bad form for a project to use a mix :-)
Apr 06 11:18:45 <nboldt>	mbooth: yeah, I've disabled autocrlf and I guess need to start over again :(
Apr 06 11:23:59 <nboldt>	ok, looks like vim respects line endings and with autocrlf disabled... this time it might work. fingers crossed.
Apr 06 11:32:48 <nboldt>	mbooth: what's the rule for backporting to f25? eg., should any of these Neon.3 changes go there too.? or just f26 and rawhide?
Apr 06 11:33:19 <mbooth>	nboldt: Yes please for f25
Apr 06 11:33:34 <nboldt>	for eclipse-egit and jgit and pydev? all three?
Apr 06 11:34:18 <nboldt>	mbooth: I assume I therefore have to push the fix and trigger a koji build... any other testing required? or do we assume if it's green in koji we're golden?
Apr 06 11:34:34 *	nboldt is happy to do diligence when it's due
Apr 06 11:34:47 <nboldt>	(but have other things on fire today too.) :D
Apr 06 11:36:48 <mbooth>	nboldt: I'm happy with koji being green for now :-) More testing will (should) happen when we submit updates through bodhi
Apr 06 11:37:22 <nboldt>	ok cool
Apr 06 12:09:17 <nboldt>	mbooth: what's the policy when pushing to old branches (f25) re: squashing vs. pushing the exact same sequence of commits
Apr 06 12:09:19 <nboldt>	?
Apr 06 12:09:41 <nboldt>	eg., I could squash and rebase the 3 commits in master down to 1 commit or leave it as 3
Apr 06 12:11:34 <mbooth>	nboldt: I usually leave as is and do a simple fast forward merge
Apr 06 12:12:11 <nboldt>	mbooth: ok, 3 commits it is :D
Apr 06 12:15:03 <ipun>	akurtakov: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94419/ this commit is the main revert of DnD
Apr 06 12:15:32 <nboldt>	*sigh* can't log into fedoraproject via kerberos again
Apr 06 12:23:07 <nboldt>	mbooth: ok, I'm spamming koji with builds: https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/userinfo?userID=nickboldt
Apr 06 12:23:48 <nboldt>	if I want to rebuild one of those (because new commits) how can I do that? tried with --skip-nvr-check but build fails with "GenericError: Build already exists"
Apr 06 12:24:45 <mbooth>	nboldt: Any changes require a release bump
Apr 06 12:24:55 <nboldt>	srly?
Apr 06 12:24:59 <nboldt>	ugh, ok
Apr 06 12:25:31 <nboldt>	so a "real build" means a release too, not just a CI that can be released later?
Apr 06 12:25:43 <nboldt>	vs. a scratch build, which is a CI ?
Apr 06 12:26:00 <mbooth>	Roughly yeah
Apr 06 12:26:19 <nboldt>	ok
Apr 06 12:26:56 <nboldt>	I've made a bit of a mess of the f26 git history for eclipse-pydev. Suppose force-pushing is bad, right?
Apr 06 12:27:20 <mbooth>	nboldt: Never tried, but I'd be surprised if it's allowed
Apr 06 12:27:34 <nboldt>	hehe, ok
Apr 06 12:27:35 <mbooth>	History being a mess is no real problem
Apr 06 12:27:42 *	mbooth shrugs
Apr 06 12:28:14 <mbooth>	It's much easier to do archeology with git than cvs :-)
Apr 06 12:30:41 <nboldt>	true
Apr 06 12:38:42 <akurtakov>	nboldt: are you pushing egit/jgit 4.7 ?
Apr 06 12:40:43 <akurtakov>	nboldt: https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/egit-dev/msg04316.html you might be on a track for fast new rebuild :)
Apr 06 12:41:28 <mbooth>	D'oh
Apr 06 12:41:41 <mbooth>	If only we'd waited another week
Apr 06 12:42:30 <akurtakov>	nah, it's perfect - try how fast it will be the second time while comparison is still in memory :)
Apr 06 13:09:14 <nboldt>	akurtakov: I grabbed 4.6.1 since that's what's in Neon.3
Apr 06 13:09:51 <nboldt>	I would think we want the same version in Fedora as in RHSCL as in devstudio 10.4
Apr 06 13:10:14 <akurtakov>	nope, fedora progresses on faster pace
Apr 06 13:10:21 <nboldt>	akurtakov: ah, ok
Apr 06 13:10:28 <nboldt>	but we need 4.6.1 in there AND 4.7?
Apr 06 13:10:40 <nboldt>	otherwise where does RHSCL get 4.6.1 from ?
Apr 06 13:10:43 <akurtakov>	rawhide should have gained oxgen 
Apr 06 13:10:50 <nboldt>	oic
Apr 06 13:10:51 <akurtakov>	already
Apr 06 13:11:03 <nboldt>	so you want 4.6.1 in F25/F26, and 4.7 in rawhide?
Apr 06 13:11:19 <nboldt>	yikes... working on too many parallel branches for my brain to keep up :D
Apr 06 13:11:23 <akurtakov>	depends on how mbooth syncs for rhscl
Apr 06 13:11:49 <nboldt>	akurtakov: well, you've lost me. I've no clue how that happens. I only know how to update a fedora eclipse-* rpm package so far 
Apr 06 13:11:56 <nboldt>	#babysteps
Apr 06 13:11:58 <akurtakov>	nboldt: ok
Apr 06 13:12:26 <akurtakov>	mbooth: so you have 4.6.1 and Neon.3 in general in rhscl already, rigth?
Apr 06 13:12:43 <mbooth>	RHSCL was synced (sunk?) from F26 more or less so it has all neon.3 stuff
Apr 06 13:13:22 <mbooth>	I'm happy for jgit/egit 4.7 to go into F25+ 
Apr 06 13:13:40 <akurtakov>	nboldt: ^ you have your answer
Apr 06 13:13:49 <akurtakov>	rhscl is done so fedora can move on
Apr 06 13:36:41 <akurtakov>	mbooth: and this jetty drives me nuts
Apr 06 13:36:47 <akurtakov>	can't smth happen easily
Apr 06 14:03:16 <nboldt>	akurtakov: mbooth: ok, so I can move egit/jgit up to 4.7 in F25+ for you
Apr 06 14:03:22 <akurtakov>	thanks

Apr 10 10:10:06 <akurtakov>	scela: I'm not even trying 
Apr 10 10:10:13 <akurtakov>	I'll create them as mails arive :)
Apr 10 10:13:36 <mbenitez>	that worked for me too
Apr 10 10:25:29 <mbooth_>	akurtakov: Jetty release was restaged: https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jetty-dev/msg02924.html
Apr 10 10:25:43 <akurtakov>	mbooth_: yeah, saw it already - nice 
Apr 10 10:26:01 <akurtakov>	mbooth_: have you tried with this release?
Apr 10 10:26:20 <mbooth_>	Not yet
Apr 10 10:26:36 <mbooth_>	I just looked at the proposed tag and it does contain my change
Apr 10 10:31:49 <scela>	mbooth_: i remember you were talking about some filters limitation for gmail compared to zimbra
Apr 10 10:31:54 <scela>	mbooth_: what was that specifically?
Apr 10 10:32:17 <mbooth_>	Oh gosh
Apr 10 10:32:36 <mbooth_>	I'm not sure I recall anymore
Apr 10 10:32:59 <mbooth_>	I think it was to do email headers
Apr 10 10:33:33 <mbooth_>	I think zimbra allowed you to create rules for arbitrary email headers in a way that gmail did not (at the time)
Apr 10 10:33:57 <scela>	mbooth_: ok. never used that stuff in zimbra I think.
Apr 10 10:34:04 <scela>	mbooth_: so hopefully there should be no surprises
Apr 10 10:40:55 <scela>	mbenitez: forgot to mention. official holidays here on coming Fri and Mon

Apr 11 14:30:10 <nboldt>	something something eclipse dark mode popups too dark to read something something
Apr 11 14:30:12 <lufimtse>	hello strykerawb 
Apr 11 14:30:13 <strykerawb>	my content assist is dark.  very dark.   black even.   can never read it.  
Apr 11 14:30:15 <strykerawb>	im not in dark mode
Apr 11 14:30:18 <strykerawb>	im in normal mode

Apr 11 14:30:36 <lufimtse>	strykerawb, sec
Apr 11 14:30:55 <strykerawb>	my content assist window comes up fine, with a correct color from settings, but,  when you click on one of the options, the 2nd content assist window that pops up to the right... has black bg
Apr 11 14:31:07 <strykerawb>	like the one that lists javadoc 
Apr 11 14:31:19 <strykerawb>	or validation on a field marked invalid 
Apr 11 14:31:21 <nboldt>	have you tried...  export GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=true
Apr 11 14:31:22 <nboldt>	or... export SWT_GTK3=0
Apr 11 14:31:25 <lufimtse>	strykerawb,  try http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/S-4.7M6-201703082000/download.php?dropFile=eclipse-SDK-4.7M6-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz

Apr 11 14:34:02 <lufimtse>	strykerawb, 
Apr 11 14:34:02 <lufimtse>	Bug 507073 – [content assist] Use fitting colors for Content assist's additional info pane 
Apr 11 14:34:02 <lufimtse>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=507073
Apr 11 14:34:25 <lufimtse>	it's on my todolist
Apr 11 14:34:32 <lufimtse>	at the moment working on Drag and Drop
Apr 11 14:34:34 <lufimtse>	for wayland
Apr 11 14:34:37 <lufimtse>	and webkit2
Apr 11 14:34:44 <lufimtse>	but the plan is to get to it...
Apr 11 14:34:59 <strykerawb>	oh ok... ... cuz im also noticing this issue in an editor?  when i use ControlDecoration on a text field
Apr 11 14:35:53 <strykerawb>	is that same issue?
Apr 11 14:35:54 <strykerawb>	lufimtse, 
Apr 11 14:36:16 <strykerawb>	i mean,  im using it in a weird error where i draw widgets and crap
Apr 11 14:36:23 <strykerawb>	but lts just say whenever i use the control decorator
Apr 11 14:36:29 <strykerawb>	and i mouse-over the little 'x' 
Apr 11 14:36:40 <strykerawb>	shit's dark... super dark... is it same issue?
Apr 11 14:37:04 <lufimtse>	strykerawb, at the moment there's a bunch of stuff that still uses SWT.INFO, so that kinda causes breakage here and there
Apr 11 14:37:15 <lufimtse>	strykerawb, solution is to use an alternative colour defined in jFace
Apr 11 14:37:32 <lufimtse>	strykerawb, but I just haven't got around to replacing these bits and pieces
Apr 11 14:38:04 <lufimtse>	strykerawb, but thank you for pointing it out, if it comes to my attention more, then I'll probably be more likley to work on it more :-)
Apr 11 14:38:12 <lufimtse>	strykerawb, after webkit2/DnD...
Apr 11 14:38:44 <strykerawb>	public Color getSystemColor (int id) {
Apr 11 14:38:44 <strykerawb>		checkDevice ();
Apr 11 14:38:44 <strykerawb>		GdkColor gdkColor = null;
Apr 11 14:38:44 <strykerawb>		switch (id) {
Apr 11 14:38:44 <strykerawb>			case SWT.COLOR_LINK_FOREGROUND: 					gdkColor = COLOR_LINK_FOREGROUND; break;
Apr 11 14:38:45 <strykerawb>			case SWT.COLOR_INFO_FOREGROUND: 					gdkColor = COLOR_INFO_FOREGROUND; break;
Apr 11 14:38:47 <strykerawb>			case SWT.COLOR_INFO_BACKGROUND: 					gdkColor = COLOR_INFO_BACKGROUND; break;
Apr 11 14:39:05 <strykerawb>	in Display class ;) 
Apr 11 14:41:12 <strykerawb>	lufimtse,  is there no setting i can change to fix this? in the meantime?
Apr 11 14:41:56 <lufimtse>	hmmmm
Apr 11 14:42:20 <lufimtse>	theoretically if you feed some gtk3-css that re-defines the systemcolor SWT.INFO is based on...
Apr 11 14:42:53 <lufimtse>	that would change look of regular tooltips also
Apr 11 14:42:57 <lufimtse>	but I guess that would be ok.
Apr 11 14:43:07 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 11 14:43:13 <strykerawb>	COLOR_INFO_BACKGROUND  is coming up black. 
Apr 11 14:43:29 <strykerawb>	:( 
Apr 11 14:43:30 <strykerawb>	so sad
Apr 11 14:45:39 <akurtakov>	strykerawb: that's correct
Apr 11 14:46:05 <akurtakov>	COLOR_INFO_BACKGROUND represents the native theme color for tooltips
Apr 11 14:46:53 <akurtakov>	issue comes when one uses COLOR_INFO_BACKGROUND without COLOR_INFO_FOREGROUND
Apr 11 14:47:27 <akurtakov>	that's when one gets black-on-black 
Apr 11 14:47:33 <lufimtse>	tooltip.background  or @define-color tooltip_bg_color  can re-define it in a gtk3-css
Apr 11 14:47:36 <lufimtse>	sec
Apr 11 14:48:11 <akurtakov>	from theming POV - there is no way one can let one color be system and the other be userdefined and not hit same-on-same color issue with some theme
Apr 11 14:48:38 <akurtakov>	one either specifies all colors or lets the system handle them all
Apr 11 14:51:21 <strykerawb>	i dont recall changing any colors ;) 
Apr 11 14:51:31 <strykerawb>	or customizing my theme
Apr 11 14:57:35 <lufimtse>	strykerawb, lemme check if one can load eclipse with a gtk3.css
Apr 11 14:57:51 <lufimtse>	btw, anyone know how to do that atm?
Apr 11 14:58:08 <strykerawb>	you know what? i think i can wait for next milestone =P 
Apr 11 14:58:15 <akurtakov>	strykerawb: well, it can be your system theme and some color that some eclipse plugin sets 
Apr 11 14:58:21 <akurtakov>	strykerawb: btw, what is your gtk theme ?
Apr 11 14:58:24 <lufimtse>	One would have to override tooltip.background {      tooltip * {  
Apr 11 14:58:30 <strykerawb>	akurtakov,  how do i check? 
Apr 11 14:58:45 <strykerawb>	im using mate... f24 mate.  no idea what else to say 
Apr 11 14:59:03 <akurtakov>	strykerawb: look for org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.theme in configuration tab on about dialog
Apr 11 14:59:52 <strykerawb>	org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.theme=BlueMenta
Apr 11 15:12:14 <akurtakov>	strykerawb: no idea what that is
Apr 11 15:12:47 <akurtakov>	please start eclipse with GTK_THEME=Adwaita env variable
Apr 11 15:21:28 <strykerawb>	tried running GTK_THEME=Adwaita ./eclipse  but didnt seem to help ;)   
Apr 11 15:21:44 <strykerawb>	not sure how to do it in eclipse.ini?
Apr 11 15:21:49 <akurtakov>	strykerawb: is there any visual change ?
Apr 11 15:22:23 <akurtakov>	the question is do you even have adwaita installed
Apr 11 15:22:45 <akurtakov>	although it should be by default
Apr 11 15:24:19 <strykerawb>	gnome-themes-standard is installed... 
Apr 11 15:28:13 <strykerawb>	trying to change my theme says adwaita isn't installed
Apr 11 15:28:14 <strykerawb>	:|
Apr 11 15:28:51 <strykerawb>	and yet its still listed there
Apr 11 15:34:13 <lufimtse>	strykerawb, well, I sort of found a workaround. But it entails compiling your own gtk from sources.
Apr 11 15:35:24 <lufimtse>	i.e, I changed the tooltip css in the Adwaina base theme, then compiled gtk with changes and run eclipse with the compiled gtk.
Apr 11 15:39:00 <strykerawb>	yeah im not doing that ;)  i dont even change my gtk themes off my default =P 
Apr 11 15:39:14 <strykerawb>	i appreciate the effort
Apr 11 15:39:28 <strykerawb>	as long as it'll be fixed by you guys eventually i'm happy ;) 
Apr 11 15:48:43 <lufimtse>	strykerawb, I suggest you add yourself as CC to this guy:

Apr 12 14:55:27 <strykerawb>	lufimtse,  i dont know what i did yesterday, but im now getting white on black 
Apr 12 14:55:47 <strykerawb>	so... :D  
Apr 12 14:55:50 <strykerawb>	thnx :D 
Apr 12 14:56:12 <lufimtse>	strykerawb, X-D
Apr 13 02:56:04 <scela>	akurtakov: morning
Apr 13 02:56:16 <akurtakov>	scela: hey, what's up
Apr 13 02:56:27 <scela>	akurtakov: slow morning
Apr 13 02:56:35 <scela>	akurtakov: making coffee
Apr 13 02:56:38 <scela>	akurtakov: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/I20170412-2000/testResults.php
Apr 13 02:56:44 <scela>	so the jdt team fixed their bug
Apr 13 02:56:51 <scela>	and i also fixed the warnings
Apr 13 02:56:56 <akurtakov>	scela: nice
Apr 13 02:56:58 <akurtakov>	thanks for that
Apr 13 02:57:02 <scela>	np
Apr 13 02:57:21 <scela>	akurtakov: took a while but it needed changes elsewhere
Apr 13 02:57:30 <akurtakov>	yeah as always
Apr 13 02:57:35 <scela>	akurtakov: was tempted to suppress but glad i got in touch with stephan
Apr 13 02:57:53 <akurtakov>	we should do the right thing even if it takes longer
Apr 13 02:58:10 <akurtakov>	except for cases where it breaks users immediately :)
Apr 13 02:58:46 <scela>	akurtakov: yeah there are always exceptions
Apr 13 02:59:36 <akurtakov>	mistria: what is the relation between tm and atom grammars 
Apr 13 02:59:59 <akurtakov>	e.g. is https://github.com/atom/language-shellscript/tree/master/grammars anything usable from tm4e
Apr 13 03:00:03 <mistria>	akurtakov: I don't know
Apr 13 03:00:17 <akurtakov>	mistria: https://github.com/atom/language-shellscript/blob/master/grammars/shell-unix-bash.cson ?
Apr 13 03:00:42 <akurtakov>	or only xml format
Apr 13 03:01:40 <mistria>	akurtakov: only xml and json format apparently https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/tree/0dc22fa65e131e3bb019818f5d7112530038ae83/org.eclipse.tm4e.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/tm4e/core/internal/grammar/parser
Apr 13 03:01:57 <mistria>	akurtakov: but it seems like adding support for cson wouldn't be too hard
Apr 13 03:02:13 <akurtakov>	well, stupid question - what's diff between cson and json :)
Apr 13 03:02:14 <mistria>	akurtakov: it's just another parser to provide and the file really look like json ones
Apr 13 03:03:06 <mistria>	akurtakov: I don't know but at first sight, it seems like cson users less {..}
Apr 13 03:03:18 <mistria>	akurtakov: cson is the json of coffeescript apparently
Apr 13 03:03:26 <mistria>	akurtakov: what a crappy world...
Apr 13 03:03:28 <akurtakov>	haha, why not create another format 
Apr 13 03:03:38 <mistria>	akurtakov: exactly
Apr 13 03:03:45 <akurtakov>	mistria: so I would better try https://github.com/textmate/shellscript.tmbundle/blob/master/Syntaxes/Shell-Unix-Bash.tmLanguage
Apr 13 03:03:53 <mistria>	akurtakov: "let's create useless work so we won't loose our jobs!"
Apr 13 03:04:08 <mistria>	akurtakov: yes, .tmLanguage is supported by tm4e
Apr 13 03:04:26 <akurtakov>	I still dont' get the whole blame on xml
Apr 13 03:04:35 <akurtakov>	as any format it can be used for good or bad :)
Apr 13 03:05:24 <akurtakov>	looks like if I want to go tm4e path I would need to spend a lot of time improving the grammars
Apr 13 03:05:44 <akurtakov>	the shell script is crappier than shelled parser now
Apr 13 03:06:49 <mistria>	akurtakov: welcome into the JavaScript community ;)
Apr 13 03:07:43 <akurtakov>	mistria: hmm, I don't feel welcomed 
Apr 13 03:08:43 <akurtakov>	can I get access to the tokens programatically somehow  from tm4e ?
Apr 13 03:11:52 <mistria>	akurtakov: I don't know if there is a good editor for those grammars
Apr 13 03:14:24 <akurtakov>	ok, so far I'm quite dissatisfied by the grammars I've tried (ruby and shell script)
Apr 13 03:15:08 <akurtakov>	even smth= is not tokenized as "assignment" and showing the thing before '=' as variable 
Apr 13 03:17:43 <mistria>	akurtakov: yes, it's only textual and regexp, there is not much semantic usually
Apr 13 03:17:57 <akurtakov>	well, this is textual
Apr 13 03:18:03 <mistria>	akurtakov: I don't know how powerful/weak those grammars are actually
Apr 13 03:18:17 <mistria>	akurtakov: I mean, how the grammar mechanism is
Apr 13 03:18:19 <akurtakov>	SMTH= is as much of a variable as $SMTH after that
Apr 13 03:18:40 <akurtakov>	now I have to find how hard it is to express it in its format
Apr 13 03:20:45 <akurtakov>	mistria: btw, tm4e causes numerous "Render from: 58 to: 58" lines in output
Apr 13 03:20:55 <akurtakov>	pretty disturbing when debugging
Apr 13 03:21:16 <mistria>	akurtakov: yes, please open a bug for it
Apr 13 03:21:33 <mistria>	akurtakov: I also think it can affect performance
Apr 13 03:22:08 <akurtakov>	mistria: also would you please fill https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.tm4e/developer
Apr 13 03:22:17 <akurtakov>	with git repo info
Apr 13 03:22:40 <mistria>	akurtakov: I think only Angelo can do it, please open an issue to request it ;)
Apr 13 03:22:59 <akurtakov>	ok, although every committer should be able to do it IIRC
Apr 13 03:25:17 <akurtakov>	issues 86 and 87
Apr 13 03:26:43 <mistria>	akurtakov: ok, I thought it was only PL who could edit it
Apr 13 03:27:14 <mistria>	akurtakov: anyway, it's better to log every request so Angelo sees what's our direction, and it leave rooms to other to contribute
Apr 13 03:27:23 <akurtakov>	sure, I did it
Apr 13 03:30:32 <akurtakov>	mistria: btw, have you heard of any release plans ?
Apr 13 03:48:25 <akurtakov>	‎[10:30] ‎<‎akurtakov‎>‎ mistria: btw, have you heard of any release plans ?
Apr 13 03:48:42 <mistria>	akurtakov: for tm4e?
Apr 13 03:48:47 <akurtakov>	yes
Apr 13 03:50:51 <mistria>	akurtakov: no big plan
Apr 13 03:51:04 <mistria>	akurtakov: I think we're waiting for one of the adopters projects to request it
Apr 13 03:51:24 <mistria>	akurtakov: IIRC Angelo wants to release Typescript.java soon, so that might force a release of a 0.1.0
Apr 13 03:52:26 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 13 06:32:16 <scela>	akurtakov: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=515243
Apr 13 06:33:03 <scela>	akurtakov: i think we are severely underestimating the damage that is being done by oomph to our installations/downloads
Apr 13 06:33:33 <scela>	akurtakov: last time i tried as a 'Simple Joe' the installer timed out after 10 minutes while the alternative 'old' download finished in <3 mins
Apr 13 06:33:56 <scela>	akurtakov: then there was the env var passthrough story which I didn't have time to follow up
Apr 13 06:33:57 <akurtakov>	well, feel free to propose an action plan 
Apr 13 06:34:49 <akurtakov>	I don't know how to fight the complicated installers insanity 
Apr 13 06:35:37 <akurtakov>	e.g. if marketplace starts installing more aggressively based on project type and etc.
Apr 13 06:36:13 <akurtakov>	or we ship some required plugins metadata in projects and resolver in platform and etc.
Apr 13 06:36:21 <akurtakov>	we can start arguing that it's not needed
Apr 13 06:36:40 <akurtakov>	now we have nothing against the "it's complex to setup" sayings
Apr 13 06:38:59 <akurtakov>	mistria: ^ btw, will this hit marketplace M7 ?
Apr 13 06:39:32 <mistria>	akurtakov: no news so far, let me ping Carsten
Apr 13 06:39:57 <scela>	akurtakov: I'll think about it how I can approach this
Apr 13 06:40:11 <scela>	akurtakov: my biggest worry is the first impression on "let's download eclipse"
Apr 13 06:40:21 <akurtakov>	well, bare tarball is not enough
Apr 13 06:40:29 <akurtakov>	oomph is total sh*t
Apr 13 06:41:45 <scela>	akurtakov: tarball downloads are very very well hidden now in the website
Apr 13 06:42:14 <scela>	akurtakov: so i believe we are relying on oomph for the delivery/installation experience
Apr 13 06:42:49 <scela>	akurtakov: tbh, I was horrified that on the only occasion I decided to play a "persona" downloading eclipse, the experience was hell
Apr 13 06:43:06 <scela>	akurtakov: and more not because it was hell, but that no-one pointed it out before
Apr 13 06:43:17 <scela>	akurtakov: imagine the numbers of users you put off this way
Apr 13 06:43:39 <akurtakov>	so what to do ?
Apr 13 06:43:51 <akurtakov>	yum install is way better IMHO :)
Apr 13 06:46:15 <scela>	i'll think about it
Apr 13 06:46:38 <scela>	akurtakov: i'll make another detailed test and see how that goes
Apr 13 06:51:03 <akurtakov>	scela: the best linux option I have thought of is creating flatpak 
Apr 13 06:51:14 <akurtakov>	and have it as recommended for all linuxes 
Apr 13 06:51:28 <akurtakov>	bypassing oomph
Apr 13 06:54:14 <akurtakov>	as if we learn people to do flatpak install to get eclipse oomph will be out of the game
Apr 13 06:54:37 <akurtakov>	scela: let me know if you're interested in working on this
Apr 13 07:05:14 <scela>	akurtakov: ok
Apr 13 07:05:29 <scela>	akurtakov: when I get back after today I'll talk to you about this
Apr 13 07:05:40 <akurtakov>	I plan on asking mbooth_ for that once oxygen lands in fedora 
Apr 13 07:05:42 <scela>	akurtakov: maybe the travel this weekend will bring some ideas :)
Apr 13 07:05:46 <akurtakov>	which I still wait for tbh :)
Apr 13 07:05:46 <scela>	akurtakov: ok
Apr 13 07:05:53 <akurtakov>	mbooth_: ^^ :P
Apr 13 07:07:12 <scela>	akurtakov: anyhow, in case i still see a degraded install experience with oomph compared to zipping (hell Eclipse is for devs, what's so advanced about unzipping) I will definitely plan to at least propose a major change
Apr 13 07:07:38 <akurtakov>	scela: sure, do it :)
Apr 13 07:07:57 *	akurtakov will be back in 30-40 mins
Apr 13 07:07:59 <scela>	if I can get mistria on _board_ it might also help ;)
Apr 13 07:08:22 <scela>	akurtakov: i might be gone by then as I'm leaving early to catch a plane
Apr 13 07:08:26 <scela>	akurtakov: tty next week
Apr 13 07:08:31 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 13 09:01:48 <mbooth_>	Re: Eclipse installers, I have a conversation like this probably once a week: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/m6oKSneBAhqa7RXGUvzWsF5M1UNdIGYhyRLivL9gydE=

Apr 18 09:06:22 <scela>	akurtakov: right - no news is good news
Apr 18 09:09:40 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: please remember your weekly reports are due now since scela will be working on the common report before he leaves
Apr 18 09:10:25 <scela>	mbenitez: there is an issue with email
Apr 18 09:10:37 <scela>	mbenitez: many people have sent it but it's not showing up

Apr 18 09:11:22 <mbenitez>	scela, ok, then I guess it'll have to be tomorrow but early your day
Apr 18 09:11:28 *	akurtakov did it twice :)
Apr 18 09:12:21 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, I think I saw your report
Apr 18 09:12:32 <mbenitez>	always 'fun' when email misbehaves
Apr 18 09:13:30 <akurtakov>	right after gmail migration but this must be co-incidence :)
Apr 18 09:13:38 <scela>	mbenitez: there was an isaac alert about it
Apr 18 09:14:01 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, suspicious indeed but let's not think badly ;)
Apr 18 09:14:22 <mbenitez>	scela, yes, saw that yesterday but didn't imagine it was ongoing, it's really bad!
Apr 18 09:14:52 <scela>	mbenitez: so you have recieved alex's email?
Apr 18 09:15:42 <mbenitez>	oh no, only Jeff's

Apr 19 07:17:29 <mistria>	scela: ok
Apr 19 07:17:34 <scela>	mistria: do we have an example of the Language Server consuming javascript?
Apr 19 07:17:41 <scela>	mistria: IIRC we had something with typescript

Apr 19 08:02:23 <akurtakov>	mistria: I really like the editor so far
Apr 19 08:02:35 <mistria>	akurtakov: the bluesky ones?
Apr 19 08:02:53 <akurtakov>	mistria: yeah, using it for html with embedded css and js
Apr 19 08:03:45 <akurtakov>	mistria: the fact that there is completion for style=" but not for class=" is down to the langserver, right?
Apr 19 08:03:57 <akurtakov>	nothing of these is handled in bluesky itself
Apr 19 08:04:03 <mistria>	akurtakov: right
Apr 19 08:04:11 <mistria>	akurtakov: you can compare with VSCode for that
Apr 19 08:04:26 <mistria>	akurtakov: if it works in vscode it's supposed to work on bluesky
Apr 19 08:04:52 <mistria>	akurtakov: if it doesn't work on vscode, open a bug to vscode; if it works on vscode and not on bluesky, open a bug to bluesky
Apr 19 08:05:17 <akurtakov>	mistria: hmm, it works in vscode
Apr 19 08:05:43 <mistria>	akuratkov: ok, so please open a bug to bluesky
Apr 19 08:06:02 <akurtakov>	let me minimize it and will do
Apr 19 08:06:13 <mistria>	akurtakov: there are often some strange options to discover, especially as the protocol evolves
Apr 19 08:07:04 <akurtakov>	man, vscode with this dark background really screws selection visibility
Apr 19 08:16:52 <akurtakov>	mistria: thanks for fixing my paste :)
Apr 19 09:21:43 <mbenitez>	scela, hello Sopot, sent you an important note, please let me know your answer in the next couple of hours
Apr 19 09:37:15 <nboldt>	Anyone using Eclipse Neon.3 w/ JDK 9? Wondering about what to do for https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22417
Apr 19 09:37:35 <nboldt>	scela: lufimtse: rgrunber: ^
Apr 19 09:38:07 <rgrunber>	scela: we ran into this right ? javax.annotation wiring
Apr 19 09:38:07 <nboldt>	or is JDK 9 support only coming to Oxygen, with no solution for Neon.3 (other than stated workaround)
Apr 19 09:38:35 <akurtakov>	nboldt: --add-modules=java.se.ee to vmargs in eclipse.ini
Apr 19 09:38:44 <nboldt>	workaround is --add-modules=java.se.ee --> https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22417?focusedCommentId=13310535&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13310535
Apr 19 09:39:03 <nboldt>	yeah, I know about the workaround akurtakov ... just wondering if Eclipse platform in Neon.3 fixed anything 
Apr 19 09:39:17 <akurtakov>	nboldt: no
Apr 19 09:39:17 <nboldt>	or if workaround is still needed 
Apr 19 09:39:20 <nboldt>	ok cool
Apr 19 09:39:24 <nboldt>	will punt this to 4.5.0 then
Apr 19 09:39:37 <akurtakov>	nboldt: it is supposed to be in M7 equinox
Apr 19 09:39:40 <akurtakov>	but hasn't landed yet
Apr 19 09:39:52 <lufimtse>	nboldt, I haven't tested JDK9 yet.
Apr 19 09:40:48 <rgrunber>	is anyone aware of any recent issues (past few days) relating to failure to upload content to downloads.eclipse.org by HIPPS ?
Apr 19 09:41:27 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: we have similar issue with platform https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=515438
Apr 19 09:41:46 <rgrunber>	it seems to me like a sync issue.. needless to say orbit is quite affected
Apr 19 09:42:37 <rgrunber>	k awesome, we're not alone
Apr 19 09:43:40 <akurtakov>	nboldt: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=493761 
Apr 19 09:47:02 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: please state the issues you face with orbit too in the bug
Apr 19 09:47:08 <rgrunber>	am doing that :)
Apr 19 09:47:16 <rgrunber>	i have maybe some extra info that might give more clues.. 
Apr 19 09:47:18 <rgrunber>	i hope
Apr 19 09:49:40 <akurtakov>	there was also the issue of signer being broken today
Apr 19 09:51:11 <rgrunber>	hmm, i think it's more fundamental. i can do 'touch /home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/fooo' that succeeds.. but 'fooo' is nowhere to be found. (i could even remove it and it succeeds). in my case i checked maybe 12hrs later and it showed up.
Apr 19 09:51:30 <rgrunber>	* performing 'touch' via the HIPP
Apr 19 09:51:59 <rgrunber>	so maybe some issue with mirroring or syncing if they're nfs mounting everything. /home/data
Apr 19 10:17:27 <rgrunber>	Any errata gurus know what "Could not get product listings for the following builds" means ? it's not for me.. someone asked..
Apr 19 10:22:57 <mbenitez>	releng needs to allow the builds, just file a ticket by emailing releng, usually best to CC the releng product owner too
Apr 19 10:23:49 <rgrunber>	k great.. i ran into this as well https://mojo.redhat.com/groups/release-engineering/blog/2017/04/03/you-may-not-know-4-n-build-rpms-not-in-product-listings-doesnt-have-to-mean-error that sort of explains it
Apr 19 10:24:51 <mbenitez>	nice
Apr 19 10:53:58 <scela>	nboldt: just had a chance to read your note
Apr 19 10:54:04 <scela>	nboldt: was that solved already?
Apr 19 10:56:12 <nboldt>	scela: solved as far as I needed to know, yes. tl;dr, not fixed in Neon.3 but there's a workaround; fix planned for Oxygen.0.M7
Apr 19 10:56:52 <nboldt>	scela: assuming you mean my IRC message above, not my email. I don't think I sent an email. did you mean mbenitez's email?
Apr 19 10:57:15 <scela>	nboldt: mbenitez's email is something else
Apr 19 10:57:24 <scela>	nboldt: i meant your java annotation stuff
Apr 19 11:18:04 <nboldt>	scela: yep, all good
Apr 19 11:21:09 <scela>	nboldt: alright
Apr 19 12:36:42 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: so there's an ongoing migration @ download.eclipse to new storage device, probably explains the delayed content.
Apr 19 12:40:24 <akurtakov>	aha

Apr 19 15:57:28 <lufimtse>	mistria, Hey ya. Is this business working? Bug 513306 - Propose solutions for missing natures
Apr 19 15:57:32 <lufimtse>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=513306
Apr 19 15:57:38 <lufimtse>	I'd like to try it
Apr 19 15:57:53 <lufimtse>	for shelled support in projects that don't have dltk nature
Apr 19 15:58:44 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: so this one is if you have the nature in the project file but shelled is not installed
Apr 19 15:58:53 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: if you have marketplace installed
Apr 19 15:59:18 <lufimtse>	Ah, I see
Apr 19 15:59:21 <lufimtse>	Still useful
Apr 19 15:59:28 <akurtakov>	and in File associations
Apr 19 15:59:33 <akurtakov>	you have selected
Apr 19 15:59:41 <akurtakov>	search via marketplace
Apr 19 15:59:51 <akurtakov>	or smth similar
Apr 19 16:00:09 <akurtakov>	on opening of .sh file marketplace will propose installing the editor
Apr 19 16:00:15 <akurtakov>	that's in neon already
Apr 19 16:01:21 <lufimtse>	I se
Apr 19 16:02:02 <lufimtse>	I'm about to submit gerrit patch where I'll be adding the dltk buildcommand (nature?) to swt & swt.tools
Apr 19 16:02:13 <lufimtse>	although I'm not sure if buildcomman==nature
Apr 19 16:03:30 <lufimtse>	 if you convert project to have shelled support, the following is added to .project:
Apr 19 16:03:31 <lufimtse>	<projectDescription> .. <buildSpec>
Apr 19 16:03:31 <lufimtse>	...<buildCommand><name>org.eclipse.dltk.core.scriptbuilder</name><arguments></arguments></buildCommand>
Apr 19 16:03:43 <lufimtse>	Not sure if above is nature or not.
Apr 19 16:03:54 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: hmm, is this needed ?
Apr 19 16:04:13 <lufimtse>	idk, but with that shelled works (outline/auto-predict)
Apr 19 16:04:23 <lufimtse>	if you take it out, shelled only does syntax highlighting
Apr 19 16:04:41 <lufimtse>	ah
Apr 19 16:04:43 <lufimtse>	SEC
Apr 19 16:04:47 <lufimtse>	it does add nature also
Apr 19 16:04:51 <lufimtse>	<nature>org.eclipse.dltk.sh.core.nature</nature>
Apr 19 16:05:12 <lufimtse>	I guess it adds nature + build command
Apr 19 16:05:24 <lufimtse>	ok, we're good I guess
Apr 19 16:05:39 <akurtakov>	hmm so only the nature is not sufficient ?
Apr 19 16:05:44 <lufimtse>	Let me try.
Apr 19 16:06:01 <akurtakov>	iirc there is no builder in shelled
Apr 19 16:06:21 <lufimtse>	in the sense that "Configure -> Add shell script support" automatically adds the build command.
Apr 19 16:06:23 <lufimtse>	sec
Apr 19 16:06:40 <akurtakov>	I see
Apr 19 16:06:55 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so if I take out the buildcommand, shelled still works
Apr 19 16:06:57 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: please open bug against shelled for this to be investigated
Apr 19 16:06:59 <lufimtse>	outlike etc...
Apr 19 16:07:00 <lufimtse>	ok. 
Apr 19 16:07:18 <lufimtse>	what is buildcommand used for anyhows?
Apr 19 16:07:23 <lufimtse>	like for running the bashscripts?
Apr 19 16:07:33 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: no idea :)
Apr 19 16:08:15 <akurtakov>	my guess - indexing, type hierarchy and etc. which make sense for ruby/tcl/etc. but not for shell
Apr 19 16:09:45 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I see
Apr 19 16:09:54 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok, I'll submit bugz.
Apr 19 16:17:31 <lufimtse>	akurtakov,  
Apr 19 16:17:31 <lufimtse>	Bug 515478 - "Configure -> Add shell script support" adds 'buildcommand' to .project without need

Apr 20 10:19:02 <mbooth_>	rgrunber: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1444015

Apr 20 10:27:16 <rgrunber>	mbooth_: if Orbit does actually introduce a newer version there's a few issues to address (1.52 might not be possible to remove as we're past M6, we're definitely past the CQ deadline)
Apr 20 10:28:39 <mbooth_>	rgrunber: Is it possible to apply patches and bump the qualifier on the old version?
Apr 20 10:30:07 <rgrunber>	mbooth_: yes, a possibility.. i would ask they set the 'modified' flag on the 1.52 bug, and promise to eventually bring in an upstream version that contains the fix at a later date.
Apr 20 10:32:02 <mbooth_>	rgrunber: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=515521
Apr 20 10:33:03 <mbooth_>	rgrunber: Feel free to remove the "committer-only" flag from the bug, I'm unsure what eclipse.org policy is for CVEs
Apr 20 10:33:35 <mbooth_>	But I think the Fedora bug is public
Apr 20 10:42:02 <akurtakov>	mbooth_: any chance to know someone having suse handy ?
Apr 20 10:43:44 <mbooth_>	akurtakov: Hmm, probably not
Apr 20 10:55:07 <scela>	akurtakov: did you try chrome for the all-hands meeting?
Apr 20 10:55:12 <scela>	akurtakov: seems to work fine for me
Apr 20 10:55:25 <akurtakov>	scela: doesn't work with chromium
Apr 20 10:55:30 <akurtakov>	and I don't have chrome
Apr 20 11:01:22 <scela>	akurtakov: ok
Apr 20 11:02:53 <akurtakov>	scela: you'll share with me if there is anything
Apr 20 11:07:38 <scela>	akurtakov: will do
Apr 20 11:08:29 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, well played! after all is part of scela's new work :P
Apr 20 11:10:17 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: :)
Apr 20 11:10:28 <akurtakov>	and I am at another call too :)
Apr 20 11:10:43 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, life of a VIP
Apr 20 11:10:57 <akurtakov>	very idiotic person ? :)
Apr 20 11:11:11 <mbenitez>	I was thinking important...
Apr 20 11:11:26 <mbenitez>	but maybe you're speaking about the mtg lead
Apr 20 11:15:52 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: haha, I was speaking of myself - why would anyone sane sign for so many things :)
Apr 20 11:16:45 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, well you have many interests and people trust you with many responsibilities
Apr 20 13:24:54 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: how do we stand with https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=507062 ?
Apr 20 13:25:18 <akurtakov>	should we get scela/mistria finishing it ?
Apr 20 13:25:21 <akurtakov>	it's due next week
Apr 20 13:26:28 <akurtakov>	or is it actually fixed?
Apr 20 14:03:06 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, start or end of next week?
Apr 20 14:03:32 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, partially, but I put it on pause while working on webkit and dnd
Apr 20 14:03:52 <lufimtse_>	akurtakov, I could work on finishing it off, the DnD work can be done after oxygen
Apr 20 14:04:01 <lufimtse_>	that colour thing might be better to do sooner
Apr 20 14:13:54 <akurtakov>	lufimtse_: jump around :)

Apr 21 11:41:02 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: ping
Apr 21 11:41:10 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: hey
Apr 21 11:42:56 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: Danny M. has proposed we back off Docker Tools for Neon.3...is it possible for us to back off the level of docker-client to 3.6.4 and still have our changes working?
Apr 21 11:43:53 <jjohnstn>	see the cross-project list
Apr 21 11:46:23 <rgrunber>	i saw the message earlier. i think it might work if we revert that commit https://git.eclipse.org/r/85313, but i haven't tested.
Apr 21 11:46:45 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: ok, I will let them know we will give it a try
Apr 21 11:53:37 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: if we cut a new point release where the plugins are back-levelled, will that affect our users using our update site?...is there some way we could patch this using p2.inf?
Apr 21 11:56:02 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I could also switch the versions back to 2.3.0 and thus users using our point release will get the newer version if they want it and can back off to the Neon.3 if they run into issues
Apr 21 11:58:34 <rgrunber>	well if a user has a 2.3.1 installed i don't think they'd get the update since it's an older version (presumably we just put an older feature version into aggregation)
Apr 21 12:03:20 <rgrunber>	yeah so if we take the route of rebuilding Neon.3 but with docker-client 3.6.4, we'd have to decide what version we call it.. i assume we don't want it being newer than 2.3.1..
Apr 21 12:14:46 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: yes...I think 2.3.0.current date would solve the issue...I can cut a new branch and build from it
Apr 21 12:17:36 <rgrunber>	sure, so it'd be 2.3.0 + the commit above reverted, and assuming that builds, and basic functionality is there it should be ok.
Apr 21 13:46:36 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: finished build, but S2016 orbit is still dragging in the 2.6.2 jackson jars...any thoughts on what I could use instead

Apr 24 10:30:04 <scela>	ipun: np
Apr 24 10:50:01 <lufimtse>	scela, sent
Apr 24 10:50:11 <scela>	lufimtse: thanks
Apr 24 10:50:15 <scela>	lufimtse: who's the new swt dev?
Apr 24 10:50:26 <lufimtse>	Seems like a german guy
Apr 24 10:50:42 <lufimtse>	sec
Apr 24 10:50:55 <scela>	lufimtse: was more interested in the name than nationality :) maybe i know him
Apr 24 10:51:13 <lufimtse>	Martin Oberhuber martin.oberhuber@windriver.com
Apr 24 10:51:15 <scela>	lufimtse: although we have definitely a majority from germany as eclipse is very popular there
Apr 24 10:51:24 <scela>	akurtakov: ^
Apr 24 10:51:40 <scela>	not sure if he's exactly the 'new swt guy' :)
Apr 24 10:51:52 <scela>	IIRC he's in the PMC with alex
Apr 24 10:51:58 <lufimtse>	He's new to swt 
Apr 24 10:52:07 <lufimtse>	was asking about how to build it etc..
Apr 24 10:52:11 <lufimtse>	but he has lots of experience
Apr 24 10:52:17 <lufimtse>	was digging around in assembly code etc..
Apr 24 10:52:38 <scela>	lufimtse: i see
Apr 24 10:52:53 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: Martin has been with eclipse for ~15 years :)
Apr 24 10:52:58 <lufimtse>	kewl
Apr 24 10:53:14 <akurtakov>	he was the resources lead at some point
Apr 24 10:53:25 <akurtakov>	also ptp and etc.
Apr 24 10:53:46 <lufimtse>	He does a very thorough job
Apr 24 10:53:52 <lufimtse>	nice to have him around in swt
Apr 24 10:54:07 <lufimtse>	atm he works on RHEL 6
Apr 24 10:54:14 <lufimtse>	so he helps make SWT work on rhel 6
Apr 24 10:55:01 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I would say that's all we will see from him
Apr 24 10:55:25 <akurtakov>	they are one of the slowest moving parts of the community
Apr 24 10:56:25 <akurtakov>	it was last year when they moved to eclipse 4.x IIRC 
Apr 24 10:56:37 <lufimtse>	ah
Apr 24 10:56:52 <akurtakov>	and they will keep rhel 6 far longer than Red Hat will support it
Apr 24 10:56:53 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 24 10:56:58 <lufimtse>	In that case it's good to have RHEL6 testers X-D
Apr 24 10:57:27 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Hey, Eclipse 4.x is still more up to date than Ubuntu packages :-o

Apr 24 12:10:25 <rgrunber>	nboldt: i have the script on my home machine it seems (not on my work one), so i'll send it this evening.. one thing i'm pretty sure i didn't do yet is scrape the I-build of an epp package from the build page.. or at least i never found a static link for latest..
Apr 24 12:11:31 <nboldt>	rgrunber: well, for a first instance we can test an S build
Apr 24 12:11:48 <nboldt>	rgrunber: thanks - do send when you get it. 
Apr 24 12:20:43 <rgrunber>	nboldt: as for our discussion on Weird Stuff Tycho Does, i get why they went with that approach. I'm willing to bet after finding the 'root' units (what's listed in the target file), when they get to having to resolve everything else they've grouped everything together and have no idea what came from where.
Apr 24 12:22:38 <rgrunber>	plus i'm sure there's legit cases where a repo ships some bundle but the dependencies are in another repository entirely.. i mean ok maybe they could check first in the same repo.. but that alone seems like it differes from how p2 would do things.. which is look at everything ..
Apr 24 12:33:13 <rgrunber>	mojo still down.. at least it isn't just me...
Apr 24 12:34:31 <scela>	rgrunber: i get 'undergoing maintenance'
Apr 24 12:35:43 <rgrunber>	yeah that's what i mean.. been like that since morning
Apr 24 12:37:27 <mistria>	rgrunber: actually, the .target format is misleading
Apr 24 12:37:36 <mistria>	rgrunber: there shouldn
Apr 24 12:37:40 <mistria>	'
Apr 24 12:37:44 <mistria>	't be units under locations
Apr 24 12:37:56 <mistria>	rgrunber: there should be a list of locations, and a list of units
Apr 24 12:38:01 <mistria>	rgrunber and that's all
Apr 24 12:39:10 <rgrunber>	mistria: fair enough.. but the current way does try to find the unit from the repositories that are listed under that location entry
Apr 24 12:39:37 <rgrunber>	it's only the transitive deps that can come from any other repository entry
Apr 24 12:40:05 <mistria>	rgrunber: ok
Apr 24 12:40:50 <rgrunber>	definitely confusing as it's not obvious until it doesn't do what you want..

Apr 24 13:03:01 <nboldt>	yes. 
Apr 24 13:03:10 <rgrunber>	yeah just the typo there on that line.
Apr 24 13:03:37 <nboldt>	thx
Apr 24 13:03:39 <nboldt>	fixed
Apr 24 13:04:45 <nboldt>	rgrunber: can you ask jjohnstn to reload his irc client? can't ping if not online :(
Apr 24 13:04:57 <nboldt>	(throw something over the wall if he's in the office.)
Apr 24 13:06:06 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: hey, so, dumb question revisited... the current docker tools 2.3.0 in Neon.3[b?] is the same as the stuff I pulled last week from your 2.3.1 site, except for the version number? 
Apr 24 13:11:11 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: not entirely.  Our code didn't change except for the changing of the version numbers.  The docker-client dependency was back-levelled to 3.4.0 from 3.6.8 so the dependencies such as httpclient and jackson jars were taken from a different Orbit repo.  I still haven't seen any confirmation that the respin has been tested or confirmed to fix the problem.
Apr 24 13:11:28 <nboldt>	ah
Apr 24 13:12:15 <nboldt>	so... JBT/devstudio currently use com.spotify.docker.client version="3.6.8.v20170223-1848
Apr 24 13:12:37 <nboldt>	which means we're "newer/better" than what's in Neon.3b (same as was in Neon.3a)
Apr 24 13:13:28 <nboldt>	if this respin (b, using 3.4.0) is live then... will we produce a conflict if both 3.4.0 and 3.6.8 are available at install time?
Apr 24 13:14:25 <nboldt>	eg., user with Neon.3b (including docker 2.3.0 (dep on 3.4.0) tries to install from update site with JBT/devstudio includes dt 2.3.1 (deps on docker.client 3.6.8) ... 
Apr 24 13:14:50 <nboldt>	I'm guessing that would work and the user would end up with your newer stuff rather than your backlevelled 2.3.0 re-release
Apr 24 13:14:58 <nboldt>	so that's GOOD. Right?

Apr 24 13:18:56 <jjohnstn>	nboldt: the only issue is with the updated httpclient and httpcore jars.  Someone claimed the fixed versions still cause issues for other Eclipse plug-ins, but in theory they should just work.
Apr 24 13:21:31 <nboldt>	"the fixed versions" being these two?

Apr 25 04:59:54 <mistria>	akurtakov: unless you think there's value in demoing it on Windows
Apr 25 04:59:59 <akurtakov>	yeah, I was asking whether it works on windows now

Apr 25 05:08:10 <mistria>	scela: "In BlueSky for Eclipse IDE, we've implemented rich editors for web-based formats in Eclipse IDE using TextMate and Language Servers within a few weeks without much difficulty. We've also started to validate that debug is pluggable in those editors."
Apr 25 05:08:20 <mistria>	akurtakov: yes, should be
Apr 25 05:08:54 <mistria>	akurtakov: but I'd be glad if you can give it a try too
Apr 25 05:09:03 <akurtakov>	sure
Apr 25 05:14:30 <scela>	mistria: ok
Apr 25 05:21:36 <akurtakov>	mistria: not there for me yet
Apr 25 05:21:49 <akurtakov>	mistria: still Computing (0/1) in js files
Apr 25 05:21:52 <akurtakov>	and no hover
Apr 25 05:21:54 <mistria>	akurtakov: ok...
Apr 25 05:22:29 <mistria>	akurtakov: did you re-install it from scratch or did an update of a previous one?
Apr 25 05:22:53 <akurtakov>	mistria: fetched master and run as inner eclipse
Apr 25 05:23:12 <mistria>	akurtakov: ok, and did you try a `mvn generate-resources` first?
Apr 25 05:23:31 <akurtakov>	no
Apr 25 05:23:40 <akurtakov>	doing it now
Apr 25 05:23:52 <akurtakov>	but I had a build before that
Apr 25 05:23:58 <akurtakov>	maybe this is the issue
Apr 25 05:25:17 <mistria>	akurtakov: yes, please delete the language-servers/node_modules folder before running `mvn generate-resources`
Apr 25 05:25:48 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 25 05:28:07 <akurtakov>	mistria: nice
Apr 25 05:28:09 <akurtakov>	works now
Apr 25 05:29:57 <akurtakov>	mistria: only issue left from my first experiment is https://github.com/mickaelistria/eclipse-bluesky/issues/8
Apr 25 05:30:51 <mistria>	akurtakov: yeah, I'll investigate it; it's a bit deeper, either directly in the LS or it means VSCode has another compeltion provider plugged in
Apr 25 05:31:19 <akurtakov>	mistria: not urgent, I really liked killing the two issues that easily :)
Apr 25 05:31:26 <mistria>	akurtakov: I'll have to dig in VSCode before I know what to do with it
Apr 25 05:32:20 <mistria>	akurtakov: yeah, I'm learning the npm magic
Apr 25 05:32:58 <mistria>	akurtakov: apparently `npm install` doesn't guarantee same result depending on whether there is content present or not already
Apr 25 05:40:06 <mistria>	akurtakov: https://github.com/mickaelistria/eclipse-bluesky/commit/e8766d4d983b55fd24a6dfef63be65dc668756ff
Apr 25 05:40:24 <mistria>	akurtakov: that should prevent from facing this issue again
Apr 25 05:40:42 <mistria>	akurtakov: not definitively, but with a lower probability
Apr 25 05:40:53 <akurtakov>	nice good to see that even dummy usage like mine is helping :)
Apr 25 05:48:52 <scela>	mistria: akurtakov always has a funky setup
Apr 25 05:49:15 <scela>	mistria: everytime i ask him to try something, there is definitely something new popping up, no matter how much i test myself
Apr 25 05:50:31 <mistria>	scela akurtakov: should it be considered as a divine gift or a curse?
Apr 25 05:51:52 <mbooth>	akurse... takov
Apr 25 05:54:13 <akurtakov>	wow :)
Apr 25 05:54:31 <akurtakov>	actually, what's weird is that I don't tweak my system at all :)
Apr 25 05:55:04 <akurtakov>	what I work on is build from source rest is without any config changes or as little as possible
Apr 25 07:50:59 <akurtakov>	mbooth: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95684/ - once this lands in you will need libsecret-devel to build 
Apr 25 08:20:18 <mbooth>	akurtakov: On x86_64 only?
Apr 25 08:20:24 <akurtakov>	mbooth: yes
Apr 25 08:20:42 <akurtakov>	I don't care to try pushing for the rest now
Apr 25 08:21:01 <akurtakov>	and if I have bringed the question it would have been delayed for post-oxygen :)
Apr 25 10:21:26 <scela>	lufimtse: ipun it's http://eclipse.etherpad.corp.redhat.com/sprint-planning? time
Apr 25 10:21:35 <lufimtse>	scela, thanks
Apr 25 10:21:39 <ipun>	scela: thank you
Apr 25 10:22:12 <lufimtse>	scela, so we update it one day before each one starts?
Apr 25 10:22:24 <lufimtse>	(I had a task to update it tomorrow).
Apr 25 10:22:34 <rgrunber>	nboldt: https://rgrunber.fedorapeople.org/aggInstall
Apr 25 10:23:39 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: seen my email?
Apr 25 10:24:04 <akurtakov>	we are really pushed by the ant  and junit changes
Apr 25 10:24:08 <rgrunber>	k seen
Apr 25 10:24:38 <scela>	lufimtse: we update it the day of the meeting usually
Apr 25 10:24:39 <akurtakov>	ant is top prio - how far are we from it ?
Apr 25 10:24:49 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 25 10:25:41 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: is there no way to have it working with versions ?
Apr 25 10:26:30 <rgrunber>	either gunnar or myself would need to patch ebr-maven-plugin to create the jars without version..
Apr 25 10:26:35 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: no, issue is that wherever someone used ant bundle in e.g. build.xml files 
Apr 25 10:26:49 <akurtakov>	these referencnes are withoug versions
Apr 25 10:27:05 <akurtakov>	so not having them means buildsystems of every project will fail
Apr 25 10:30:21 <rgrunber>	k i'll look at what can be done to change the behaviour
Apr 25 10:33:52 <rgrunber>	i'll look through what's needed for junit as well.. after the ant work gets in.
Apr 25 10:41:22 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: so I refer to http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ua.git/tree/org.eclipse.help.webapp/buildJSPs.xml#n39 and similar hardcoded
Apr 25 10:41:39 <akurtakov>	while technically they would not be hard to fix
Apr 25 10:41:45 <akurtakov>	the amount of them is scary
Apr 25 10:43:02 <akurtakov>	and doing it at M7 would pretty much break the build of everything against M7 which is a clear no-go
Apr 25 10:58:44 <mbenitez>	eclipse-team: sprint demo session starting in ~2min
Apr 25 10:59:03 <mbenitez>	https://redhat.bluejeans.com/6300487397
Apr 25 11:18:07 <akurtakov>	jjohnstn: what do you think about disabling the broken httpclient bundles in linuxtools release ?
Apr 25 11:18:10 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: ^^
Apr 25 11:20:57 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: you mean re-releasing our won stuff with the fix Jeff made for Neon.3 aggregation ? If it works and no regressions are encountered i don't see why not..
Apr 25 11:21:03 <rgrunber>	own*
Apr 25 11:21:25 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: I've been told that p2 can actively disable bundles 
Apr 25 11:21:37 <akurtakov>	so they are not used by the resolver
Apr 25 11:29:35 <mbenitez>	mistria, really good demo!
Apr 25 11:29:45 <mistria>	mbenitez: thanks
Apr 25 11:29:48 <mbenitez>	scela, good job representing the group
Apr 25 11:30:30 <scela>	mbenitez: thanks
Apr 25 11:40:46 <akurtakov>	jjohnstn: rgrunber: so if you agree on such approach disabling bundle and if the bundle we ship is so badly broken
Apr 25 11:41:11 <akurtakov>	would you please contact Pascal and/or Tom Watson asking how to do that
Apr 25 11:41:24 <akurtakov>	so we can have it in our toolbox if needed
Apr 25 11:41:45 <akurtakov>	it could also fix the case for people that have Neon.3a 
Apr 25 11:41:58 <akurtakov>	err that have Neon.3 and update to .3a
Apr 25 11:52:32 <jjohnstn>	akurtakov: I'm not sure what you are proposing...the new Neon.3 aggregation shouldn't bring those in anymore...fwiw: we don't work when the new Neon.3 aggregation docker tooling is added to the EPP for committers Neon.3..looking at it :(
Apr 25 11:54:06 <akurtakov>	jjohnstn: so if I get it right people that updated to Neon.3 will continue facing resolver issue, right?
Apr 25 11:54:26 <akurtakov>	as they would still have newer/broken httpclient
Apr 25 11:56:57 <jjohnstn>	akurtakov: only if they installed us with the higher level of httpclient/httpcore...if they uninstall and reinstall, it should in theory remove the bad plugins...rgrunber would need to confirm this
Apr 25 11:58:18 <akurtakov>	jjohnstn: so I'm talking of smth like p2.inf with uninstallBundle  for the broken httpclient 
Apr 25 11:58:43 <akurtakov>	but this might need to be clarified with p2 guys first as it might be crazy idea :)
Apr 25 11:58:52 <akurtakov>	https://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Fguide%2Fp2_actions_touchpoints.html
Apr 25 11:58:56 <jjohnstn>	akurtakov: I see
Apr 25 11:59:27 <akurtakov>	so even this case is covered
Apr 25 11:59:47 <akurtakov>	jjohnstn: aka RPM's Obsolete in p2 :)
Apr 25 12:37:07 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: isn't it a problem that uninstallBundle doesn't seem to take some kind of version ?
Apr 25 14:41:53 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: that's a problem yeah, so you can't specify a version to uninstall?
Apr 25 14:44:03 <rgrunber>	not according to the docs, bundle is just a bundle-id
Apr 25 14:45:52 <akurtakov>	well, if that's the case - we can't proceed
Apr 25 15:12:59 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: what if I force the httpclient and httpcore reqs for docker.core?  on an update, would the newer http packages then not be used by anything and disappear?
Apr 25 15:13:59 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: hmm, I guess other packages might just specify 0.0.0 and so the package would still fill some req
Apr 25 15:30:40 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: not exactly sure what would happen in that case, would need to test it out
Apr 25 16:22:02 <rgrunber>	jjohnstn: yeah exactly what you said.. newer bundle remains because an older one could wire to it..
Apr 25 16:22:16 <rgrunber>	s/could/does/
Apr 25 16:29:04 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: I tried removing my new Docker Tooling feature and reinstalling the Neon.3 version.  After restarting and getting errors, I reinstalled the new one.  It restarted without errors and Docker Tooling functionality works.
Apr 25 16:32:24 <rgrunber>	how many httpclient versions are on the system ?
Apr 25 16:51:23 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: not counting commons.httpclient...2 httpclients: 4.3.6 and 4.5.2...2 httpcore 4.3.3 and 4.4.4
Apr 25 17:03:37 <rgrunber>	hmm and it all works ?
Apr 25 17:04:21 <rgrunber>	weren't there some complaints from projects that there were uses constraint issues or something ?.. i thought there were issues beyond just fixing httpclient 4.5.2.
Apr 25 17:18:57 <jjohnstn>	rgrunber: it seems to...but I would need to see others test it and report their findings...nothing shows up in error log on start-up
Apr 26 03:18:11 <akurtakov>	mistria: mornign
Apr 26 03:18:23 <mistria>	akurtakov: hello
Apr 26 03:18:54 <akurtakov>	I just sawyour comment
Apr 26 03:19:08 <akurtakov>	so this tsserver is not using the LSP ?
Apr 26 03:19:35 <mistria>	akurtakov: no, tsserver doesn't
Apr 26 03:19:47 <akurtakov>	but it's still MS project ?
Apr 26 03:19:50 <mistria>	akurtakov: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/11274
Apr 26 03:19:57 <mistria>	akurtakov: yes
Apr 26 03:20:16 <mistria>	akurtakov: we're using a "layer on top" of it, which reduces the quality of the server
Apr 26 03:20:28 <akurtakov>	I see
Apr 26 03:20:51 <mistria>	akurtakov: I think tsserver would welcome support for LSP, it wouldn't be too hard
Apr 26 03:21:01 <mistria>	akurtakov: but it doesn't seem to be a priority for them
Apr 26 03:21:26 <mistria>	akurtakov: if we (Red Hat, not specifically our team) want to invest in better typescript, we should work on this issue
Apr 26 03:21:27 <akurtakov>	and if/when this happens bluesky and typescript.java could merge ?
Apr 26 03:21:37 <mistria>	akurtakov: Che is using too
Apr 26 03:21:59 <mistria>	akurtakov: yes, probably
Apr 26 03:22:14 <mistria>	akurtakov: you mean WTP and typescript.java ;)
Apr 26 03:22:32 <akurtakov>	if bluesky took over WTP by then - yes :)
Apr 26 03:23:21 *	akurtakov really hates having 3 top level Java Script preferences in eclipse :)
Apr 26 03:26:40 <akurtakov>	mistria: btw, can you point me to where contributions to release train are defined
Apr 26 03:27:15 <mistria>	akurtakov: http://git.eclipse.org/c/simrel/org.eclipse.simrel.build.git/tree/
Apr 26 03:27:44 <mistria>	akurtakov: http://git.eclipse.org/c/simrel/org.eclipse.simrel.build.git/tree/simrel.aggr is the "master" file, and each file is an individual project ocntribution
Apr 26 03:28:14 <akurtakov>	meh <features href="linuxtools.aggrcon#//@repositories.0/@features.1"/> :)
Apr 26 03:29:05 <akurtakov>	whatever that means :)
Apr 26 03:29:18 <akurtakov>	anyway, thanks for the pointer
Apr 26 03:32:13 <mistria>	akurtakov: means that it adds to the model the feature with index 1 defined in the repository with index 0
Apr 26 03:32:51 <mistria>	in a java-like world, it's `linuxtools.aggrcon`.repositories/repositories[0]/features[1]
Apr 26 03:33:30 <mistria>	sorry, I meant `linuxtools.aggrcon`.repositories[0].features[1
Apr 26 03:33:33 <mistria>	]
Apr 26 03:35:35 <scela>	mistria: http://langserver.org/
Apr 26 03:35:58 <scela>	mistria:there's a full blown php server it seems
Apr 26 03:36:07 <scela>	mistria: in a mood for killing PDT also ? ;)
Apr 26 03:36:11 <mistria>	scela: yes, there is
Apr 26 03:36:23 <mistria>	scela: there are 2 actually: one from Zend, the other from SourceGraph
Apr 26 03:36:42 <mistria>	scela: Michal from PDT has made a PHP editor based on LSP and is actively contributing
Apr 26 03:36:56 <scela>	mistria: cool, didn't know that
Apr 26 03:36:59 <mistria>	scela: seems like Zend is taking that direction, and may move PDT at some point
Apr 26 03:37:01 <scela>	mistria: can we reuse that?
Apr 26 03:37:15 <mistria>	scela: to get where?
Apr 26 03:37:26 <mistria>	scela: I think it's better to let PHP professional take care of it
Apr 26 03:37:42 <scela>	mistria: yeah makes sense if they are going in that direciton
Apr 26 03:37:57 <scela>	mistria: i was surprised there is already servers for so many languages
Apr 26 03:38:00 <scela>	akurtakov: ^
Apr 26 03:38:06 <scela>	mistria: this thing is picking up fast
Apr 26 03:38:11 <mistria>	scela: https://github.com/eclipselabs/lsp4e-php
Apr 26 03:38:34 <scela>	mistria: really nice
Apr 26 03:38:51 <akurtakov>	scela: mistria: I had phone call with Kaloyan (a month or so ago) about it
Apr 26 03:39:11 <akurtakov>	they are definetely looking into moving in that direction
Apr 26 03:39:38 <scela>	akurtakov: yeah but it's not only about php
Apr 26 03:39:39 <akurtakov>	but it's still not on par with their current one
Apr 26 03:39:50 <scela>	akurtakov: that list has a list of almost all relevant languages
Apr 26 03:40:02 <scela>	python seems has a full blown one
Apr 26 03:40:14 <scela>	rust also
Apr 26 03:40:20 <akurtakov>	scela: sadly, it's not the editor only
Apr 26 03:40:23 <mistria>	akurtakov: I think a Language Server is never going to be on par with a good parser and a good DOM used directly in a tool
Apr 26 03:40:42 <akurtakov>	you have to integrate it with unit support, packaging systems and etc.
Apr 26 03:41:34 <akurtakov>	mistria: well, in the case of PHP I believe it will be simpler as the current parser is not that good anyway
Apr 26 03:41:35 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 26 03:41:41 <scela>	akurtakov: yeah but that's the same as say wtp
Apr 26 03:41:47 <scela>	with server support and all that
Apr 26 03:41:59 <scela>	the way i see it we're looking to mainly provide editing support
Apr 26 03:42:05 <scela>	rather than full blown integration
Apr 26 03:42:17 <akurtakov>	scela: exactly, that's why it makes sense to target replacing editors in the already existing projects rather than "killing" them
Apr 26 03:42:28 <akurtakov>	so we can get both
Apr 26 03:42:40 <akurtakov>	scela: btw, please find me a ruby language server
Apr 26 03:42:47 <akurtakov>	I'm eager to redo dltk ruby
Apr 26 03:42:49 <scela>	akurtakov: that was a pre-coffee choice of words  so don't read much into it ..
Apr 26 03:43:17 <akurtakov>	scela: fwiw, what a coincidence in thinking https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/dltk-dev/msg02582.html
Apr 26 03:43:51 <scela>	akurtakov: yeah the python part you mean?
Apr 26 03:43:57 <akurtakov>	yup
Apr 26 03:44:20 <akurtakov>	I don't trust Fabio to be fast moving 
Apr 26 03:44:51 <akurtakov>	although pydev is way better known and has tons of features (probabl the most featureful python ide)
Apr 26 03:45:32 <akurtakov>	btw, Pascal gave me +1 
Apr 26 03:46:42 <scela>	akurtakov: he would have made a really bad impression would he have voted otheriwise
Apr 26 03:47:17 <scela>	akurtakov: i wouldn't worry about 'better known'
Apr 26 03:48:16 <akurtakov>	scela: this still leaves the second part about pylint, pep, jython/ironpython, django....
Apr 26 03:48:58 <mistria>	akurtakov: pylint can be turned into a language server
Apr 26 03:49:20 <mistria>	akurtakov: but it can be bound directly to the IDE has a resource or document listener too
Apr 26 03:49:46 <akurtakov>	mistria: yeah, but the question is is it done, who will do it, when, is this us ... ?
Apr 26 03:50:21 <akurtakov>	that's why I prefer the redo parts of existing projects so we don't end up maintainers of more things :)
Apr 26 03:50:33 <mistria>	akurtakov: right
Apr 26 03:51:27 <scela>	akurtakov: mistria nice to see that RH is featured in most of these projects as spearheading the effort
Apr 26 03:51:41 <scela>	if this thing takes off fast we will have a competitive advantage over the rest of IDEs
Apr 26 03:52:06 <mistria>	scela: we already have it
Apr 26 03:52:22 <mistria>	scela: when we did the demo last week,, people where really impressed
Apr 26 03:52:36 <mistria>	scela: a question was "what's the state of NetBeans and IJ regarding LSP"
Apr 26 03:52:46 <mistria>	scela: and the answer was "nothing"
Apr 26 03:52:53 <scela>	mistria: :) i'm pretty sure you were happy answering that question
Apr 26 03:52:59 <mistria>	scela: which was really disappointing for IJ fanboys
Apr 26 03:53:17 <mistria>	scela: I was drinking their tears
Apr 26 03:53:37 <mistria>	(not sure that translates well)
Apr 26 03:53:43 <scela>	mistria: another glass for me please
Apr 26 03:54:08 <mistria>	scela: run the same presentation in your place if you want
Apr 26 03:54:19 <scela>	mistria: i'm waiting for this to get a bit more famous and us releasing oxygen
Apr 26 03:54:29 <mistria>	scela: ok
Apr 26 03:54:44 <scela>	mistria: and I'll start a full blown marketing push about the fact that we're the first to have it and the rest is way behind
Apr 26 03:56:48 <scela>	akurtakov: btw, eclipse marketing people contacted me and they want me to start doing presentation on tips and tricks and the @EclipseJavaIDE account
Apr 26 03:56:57 <scela>	mistria: ^
Apr 26 03:56:59 <scela>	on some meetups
Apr 26 03:57:20 <mistria>	scela: good
Apr 26 03:57:47 <mistria>	scela: beware, you're starting to enjoy it; in a few years you'll be doing advertisement for McDonalds rather than coding cool stuff with us
Apr 26 03:57:49 <mistria>	;)
Apr 26 03:58:54 <scela>	mistria: oh man, McDonalds ...
Apr 26 03:59:42 <akurtakov>	mistria: nah scela will be advertising smth with real meat in it  and really BIG :)
Apr 26 04:00:20 <akurtakov>	first google result was http://bigtexan.com/72-oz-steak/ but it matches my expectation :)
Apr 26 04:01:37 <scela>	akurtakov: when I first saw a McDonalds burger i was expecting the meat to come after it
Apr 26 04:01:50 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 26 04:02:46 <scela>	mistria: but seriously I'm enjoying it yes and I see this as a different way of helping with the overall success of the technical part we are working on
Apr 26 04:02:58 <scela>	mistria: especially considering the competition environment we are in
Apr 26 04:03:22 <mistria>	scela: I can easily understand that
Apr 26 04:03:31 <mistria>	scela: it's really working moreover, so it's stimulating
Apr 26 04:03:55 <mistria>	scela: it's a fun thing to find some users who think a 13 years old feature is now and was inspired by IJ
Apr 26 04:04:16 <scela>	mistria: yeah
Apr 26 04:04:19 <akurtakov>	mistria: what do you refer to ?
Apr 26 04:04:23 <mistria>	scela: it shows how users were under-rated in Eclipse IDE development
Apr 26 04:04:27 <mistria>	akurtakov: the scope selection in JDT
Apr 26 04:04:31 <akurtakov>	ah
Apr 26 04:04:42 <mistria>	akurtakov: block selection too was new for some users
Apr 26 04:05:31 <scela>	mistria: yes and that is my strategic direction to fill this underrated gap
Apr 26 04:05:43 <scela>	mistria: as only after that is competition fair
Apr 26 04:06:34 <scela>	mistria: and I'll employ any tactical moves towards that direction
Apr 26 04:06:55 <scela>	mistria: as up to now marketing of the IDE has been some kind of 'groping in the dark'
Apr 26 04:07:33 <mistria>	scela: http://devhumor.com/media/eclipse-vs-intellij
Apr 26 04:07:44 <mistria>	scela: I find it very realistic of many IJ users
Apr 26 04:08:03 <mistria>	scela: they simply want to hate Eclipse, no matter what
Apr 26 04:08:35 <scela>	mistria: yes I have noticed that but I still haven't made up my mind on the root cause
Apr 26 04:08:45 <scela>	mistria: i need a bit more time 
Apr 26 04:08:57 <mistria>	scela: I think it's really a matter of "choosing a side"
Apr 26 04:09:21 <scela>	mistria: well I have chosen my side but I'm not like that
Apr 26 04:09:37 <scela>	mistria: and i know very few people in Eclipse who think like that
Apr 26 04:09:46 <mistria>	scela: same as OSX vs Win vs Linux; many discussions end up in "religious" ideas rather than technical causes
Apr 26 04:10:14 <scela>	mistria: maybe
Apr 26 04:10:16 <scela>	mistria: maybe not
Apr 26 04:10:28 <mistria>	scela: there are definitely a lot of things that are nicer in IJ than in Eclipse
Apr 26 04:10:39 <mistria>	scela: auto content assist for example
Apr 26 04:10:54 <mistria>	scela: as long as Eclipse doesn't have this, there will be people to hate Eclipse IDE
Apr 26 04:11:05 <mistria>	scela: and a few other ones
Apr 26 04:11:30 <scela>	mistria: honestly i want to take the supposition part out of the equation
Apr 26 04:11:41 <scela>	mistria: i want to hear people after 'bombarding' them for a year or two with eclipse tips
Apr 26 04:11:52 <mistria>	scela: but Eclipse IDE has its strengthes, that things such as the @EclipseJavaIDE account highlight and share successfully
Apr 26 04:12:26 <scela>	mistria: and the first part is to get people talking about it. before I grabbed the #EclipseTips hashtag it contained a bunch of tips about how to watch the eclipse saga movies
Apr 26 04:12:26 <mistria>	scela: multi-project, as you type validation on java...
Apr 26 04:12:33 <akurtakov>	my theory is that Eclipse is hated cause many companies standardized on it so it was kind of enforced on many
Apr 26 04:13:28 <scela>	as I said I welcome the suppositions (and I have mine) but I am not acting on any supposition until i see myself what people think after a certain time of looking at eclipse tips
Apr 26 04:13:40 <mistria>	scela: +1
Apr 26 04:14:05 <scela>	fixing this takes time and i have plenty
Apr 26 04:14:45 <scela>	i'll wait for our informative pushes to give mass results and then we'll see
Apr 26 04:15:32 <mistria>	scela: the great thing with this Eclipse tips is that it spread the knowledge. For one twitter account liking a feature, you can imagine the "liker" shares this with 3 or 4 colleagues
Apr 26 04:15:46 <mistria>	scela: it's just good material to make people talk in a good way about Eclipse IDE
Apr 26 04:16:13 <mistria>	scela: it's the best way of doing marketing I guess
Apr 26 04:16:40 <scela>	mistria: that's the tactic i have chosen for now for the strategic direction i mentioned above
Apr 26 04:16:52 <scela>	mistria: when you do this for a while then devs start doing it for you
Apr 26 04:16:58 <scela>	spreading the word really fast
Apr 26 04:17:07 <mistria>	scela: I don't know how much it's related to the Eclipse tips, but I see less and less "Eclipse sucks" on twitter
Apr 26 04:17:34 <mistria>	scela: there are good things happening in the IDE directly for sure, with many fixes; but the image seems to be changing too
Apr 26 04:17:53 <mistria>	scela: could be the result of the marketing campaings on twitter, on newsletter...
Apr 26 04:18:13 <scela>	mistria: it is probably related as I'd be surprised if it's a coincidence it's changing now considering we haven't released anything
Apr 26 04:18:50 <mistria>	akurtakov: As you're becoming a marketing person, you'll soon need finer metrics
Apr 26 04:18:53 <mistria>	scela: ^
Apr 26 04:19:04 <mistria>	scela: such as: how many people are now using Neon vs Mars
Apr 26 04:19:06 <akurtakov>	mistria: I'm definetely not becoming one :)
Apr 26 04:19:13 <scela>	mistria: you really like to tease me don't you ;)
Apr 26 04:19:41 <mistria>	scela: many users don't update as we release stuff, there is a latency that can explain that effects of efforts are perceived monthes after the delivery
Apr 26 04:20:07 <mistria>	scela: without metrics, it's a bit hard to know on what people are making their opinion
Apr 26 04:20:51 <mistria>	scela: I'm actually pretty happy with your interest and enthusiasm in that, it serves us very well
Apr 26 04:21:08 <mistria>	scela: I'm not (too much) teasing
Apr 26 04:21:29 <scela>	mistria: haha we have been dealing with markus for years - your teasing is kids play
Apr 26 04:21:58 <mistria>	scela: :D
Apr 26 04:21:58 <scela>	mistria: but yes i'll be needing more metrics
Apr 26 04:22:12 <scela>	mistria: and crucially more assistance from EF people
Apr 26 04:22:44 <scela>	mistria: but if i think of all the stuff i will be needing and facing my mind gets into a bottleneck and hardly anything pushes through
Apr 26 04:22:50 <scela>	so for now my goal is very very simple
Apr 26 04:22:59 <scela>	have as much people as possible talk about the cool stuff of eclipse
Apr 26 04:23:10 <scela>	once I'm happy with this i'll follow through the rest
Apr 26 04:23:52 <scela>	mistria: same way as we started this: let's just created and let people discuss in the meantime in the mailing list ;)
Apr 26 04:24:00 <scela>	*create it
Apr 26 07:15:39 <akurtakov>	with css themes tm4e starts to look more promising
Apr 26 07:51:21 <akurtakov>	scela: small issue with your validation patch
Apr 26 08:07:26 <scela>	akurtakov: nice catch thanks
Apr 26 08:50:20 <akurtakov>	scela: will you be joining scrum of scrums calls ?
Apr 26 08:52:18 <mbenitez>	actually I had not told him about them, maybe you can explain?
Apr 26 08:52:36 <mbenitez>	fwiw for a while if we're green we don't really speak
Apr 26 08:55:31 <akurtakov>	let's keep it fornext time in this case :)
Apr 26 08:55:39 <akurtakov>	few min notice isnot enough
Apr 26 09:03:47 <mbenitez>	good idea, also with Summit mtgs are a bit different
Apr 26 09:06:40 <scela>	mbenitez: akurtakov ok
Apr 26 09:35:58 <mistria>	mbenitez akurtakov: what would be a good namespace for an eclipse plugin integrating the Bayesian LS? The LS is https://github.com/msrb/component-analysis-lsp-server , so should the plugin be org.jboss.tools.componentanalysis, or com.redhat.devstudio.componentanalysis or ... ?
Apr 26 09:40:41 <mbenitez>	mistria, Bayesian was supposed to be a confidential project until Summit, before creating anything public please reach out to their team
Apr 26 09:41:51 <akurtakov>	mistria: I would say use similar namespace to what they use :)
Apr 26 10:10:11 <mistria>	akurtakov: so that would be com.redhat.bayesian.lsp.eclipse 
Apr 26 10:10:23 <akurtakov>	mistria: works for me
Apr 26 10:49:22 <rgrunber>	does anyone here use mattermost for eclipse channels ?
Apr 26 10:50:45 <ericwill>	rgrunber I believe lufimtse does
Apr 26 10:51:01 <rgrunber>	seeing 60% network drops to PHX2 going through the ip 
Apr 26 10:51:01 <rgrunber>	                  66.187.228.249 for fedoraproject.org systems. packets going 
Apr 26 10:51:01 <rgrunber>	                  to PHX2 through 66.187.228.248 for sourceware.org are not 
Apr 26 10:51:09 <rgrunber>	oops.. wrong window
Apr 26 10:51:22 <akurtakov>	ericwill: hey, warming up for your return :)
Apr 26 10:51:48 <ericwill>	akurtakov yes, have a few days left on my part time contract and then full time starts May 22 :)
Apr 26 10:53:49 <akurtakov>	ericwill: if you have time would you please look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95734/ 
Apr 26 10:54:16 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, I used it for a while
Apr 26 10:54:16 <akurtakov>	ipun is looking at it but having him on the launchbar issue more would be helpful
Apr 26 10:54:42 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, I used it for a while, but no one else was using it, so I kinda stopped using it.
Apr 26 10:55:07 <rgrunber>	lufimtse: oh.. i was wondering if people i might not find on irc would be on it..
Apr 26 10:55:10 <ericwill>	akurtakov will take a look
Apr 26 10:55:16 <akurtakov>	thanks
Apr 26 10:56:22 <ipun>	technically they're both now launchbar issues :/
Apr 26 10:56:52 <akurtakov>	ipun: well, launchbar is only one case for what I asked Eric to look at
Apr 26 10:57:23 <akurtakov>	it can also be seen in Preferences/General/Keys
Apr 26 10:57:59 <akurtakov>	top most and bottom most combos 
Apr 26 11:02:20 <ipun>	akurtakov: yeah ive noticed. THe patch i put in fixes the alignment a bit, but cuts off the arrow
Apr 26 11:04:04 <akurtakov>	ipun: note that if you make it smaller on the launchbar page where there is component after the combo
Apr 26 11:04:13 <akurtakov>	it starts to overlap with it after your patch
Apr 26 11:05:48 <ipun>	akurtakov: yeah, unforuantely doesnt fix the launchbar issue, baiscally now its overlapping something else 
Apr 26 11:06:25 <ipun>	ericwill: pull a copy of Lauchbar, and look at LaunchBarConfigDialog.java, the relevent information should be there
Apr 26 11:06:29 <akurtakov>	the issue is it's not shrinking which it should be
Apr 26 11:06:57 <akurtakov>	that's why we have swtfixed to make sure that we can make widgets smaller 
Apr 26 11:07:04 <akurtakov>	the key is somewhere there :)
Apr 26 11:09:49 <ipun>	akurtakov: im going to look into the launchbar menu then
Apr 26 11:47:43 <akurtakov>	fyi https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/freeze_plan_4_7.php
Apr 26 13:06:09 <rgrunber>	mbooth: new bug introduce by tycho itself ?
Apr 26 13:15:50 <rgrunber>	hmm probably something related to contents of boostrap folder..
Apr 26 13:17:43 <rgrunber>	ahh the ol' guess the builder issue for bootstrap builds..
Apr 26 13:45:53 <nboldt>	hey rgrunber mbooth know anything about javaewah ? Seems the latest in rhscl / fedora24 is 0.8.4 but I've got something in RH Central that is asking for [1.1.6,2.0.0) and I can't resolve that
Apr 26 13:46:57 <rgrunber>	nboldt: well 1.1.6 was recently added to Orbit.. by Matthias Sohn so my guess is maybe egit/jgit ?
Apr 26 13:47:16 <nboldt>	yeah, jgit is asking for it
Apr 26 13:48:16 <rgrunber>	so jgit 4.4.1 asks for [0.7.9,0.8.0), but jgit 4.6.0 asks for [1.1.6,2.0.0)
Apr 26 13:48:37 <rgrunber>	just from looking in the oxygen (pre-)release repo
Apr 26 13:48:51 <nboldt>	so we're missing something in rhscl?
Apr 26 13:49:18 <nboldt>	since we have jgit 4.6.1 now which Import-Package: com.googlecode.javaewah; version="[1.1.6,2.0.0)"
Apr 26 13:50:56 <rgrunber>	hmm, http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/eclipse-jgit.git/tree/eclipse-jgit.spec#n69
Apr 26 13:51:14 <rgrunber>	apparently it just works to ask for the lower one.. so maybe nothing used has changed api.
Apr 26 13:51:54 <rgrunber>	hmm and WORD_IN_BITS vs. wordinbits ..
Apr 26 14:02:02 <nboldt>	so... I can't use rhscl in F24 anymore? is that the solution here?
Apr 26 14:06:29 <mbooth>	Well, F24 is not a supported target for RHSCL...
Apr 26 14:08:21 <mbooth>	But there's probably no problem updating javaewah in Fedora -- I think jgit is the only consumer
Apr 26 14:10:59 <nboldt>	mbooth: just means I need a new way to test RHSCL stuff on my local machine... may have to move up to F26 soon 
Apr 26 14:11:37 <mbooth>	Yeah, I'm waiting for new laptop to arrive and will jump up to latest F26 too
Apr 26 14:12:07 <mbooth>	nboldt: But I usually test RHSCL in a RHEL 7 VM
Apr 26 14:12:36 <nboldt>	I need more ram to run a second VM ... usually run F24 in a VM on top of Windows
Apr 26 14:12:56 <nboldt>	but yeah, that might have to happen :) Or move my F24 -> F25
Apr 28 09:26:17 <mbenitez>	mbooth, hello Mat, any update on the zstream errata?
Apr 28 09:33:58 <mbenitez>	akurtakov, mbooth please send your status reports today so Sopot can work on the weekly on Monday, thanks!
Apr 28 09:34:12 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: sure
Apr 28 09:35:05 <mbenitez>	thanks! and enjoy the long weekend :)
Apr 28 09:36:22 *	scox is away: dentist
Apr 28 10:02:19 <akurtakov>	mbenitez: thank you :0
Apr 28 10:54:26 *	scox is back (gone 01:18:04)
Apr 28 11:12:44 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk is producing an error for me: 
Apr 28 11:12:45 <lufimtse>	http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1493392282.png
Apr 28 11:13:07 <lufimtse>	"Access restriction: The method "OS.setDarkThemePreferred(..); is not API"
Apr 28 11:13:09 <lufimtse>	any ideas?
Apr 28 11:13:36 <akurtakov>	seems like you have stricter api.tooling settings
Apr 28 11:14:11 <akurtakov>	go to API Errors/Warnings pref page and reset to default
Apr 28 11:17:47 <akurtakov>	mbooth: fedora doesn'build  ppc (32bit) right?
Apr 28 11:19:00 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok, let me try
Apr 28 11:23:29 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I have everything set to defaults, issue still seems to occur... hmmm
Apr 28 11:23:45 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I could try to turn off some warnings, 
Apr 28 11:24:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, because of that, gtk native dark theme is not triggered when I turn on dark theme in child eclipse
Apr 28 11:25:17 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: you mean that the bundle loaded has build error and thus isnot loaded
Apr 28 11:25:21 <akurtakov>	that's normal
Apr 28 11:25:28 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Correct, there's been no ppc32 builds for a while
Apr 28 11:25:30 <akurtakov>	go into your java compiler settingss
Apr 28 11:26:00 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: and look for Discouraged references
Apr 28 11:26:07 <akurtakov>	it should not be error
Apr 28 11:34:47 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I found that "Forbidden reference" triggers this. By default it is "Error" and "org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk" does not override this setting. So as a result there is a problem. I could submit a patch that sets this to "warning" for the project?
Apr 28 11:35:06 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, or implement a public api in SWT that doesn't do anyhting on win32/cocoa
Apr 28 11:35:08 <lufimtse>	hmmmm
Apr 28 11:35:30 <lufimtse>	idk
Apr 28 11:35:37 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: the later is a nogo
Apr 28 11:35:50 <akurtakov>	any api should be implemented on at least 2 out of the 3 WS
Apr 28 11:36:11 <lufimtse>	I see
Apr 28 11:36:12 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 28 11:36:15 <akurtakov>	weirdly it's warning for me
Apr 28 11:36:41 <akurtakov>	but it should be fine to make it warning for that bundle
Apr 28 11:36:45 <akurtakov>	please do so
Apr 28 11:37:38 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok.
Apr 28 11:37:49 <lufimtse>	try "set to default"
Apr 28 11:37:53 <lufimtse>	then it'll complain.
Apr 28 11:37:59 <lufimtse>	and rebuild workspace...
Apr 28 11:38:22 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: well, I trust you
Apr 28 11:38:36 <akurtakov>	just lower to warning for the bundle
Apr 28 11:52:52 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/96045/
Apr 28 11:53:12 <lufimtse>	this is sets it for the project
Apr 28 11:53:30 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I added that line manually,
Apr 28 11:54:05 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, alternativley I could also click on "enable project specific settings" and change it that way. This adds lots of lines into the prefs
Apr 28 11:54:43 <akurtakov>	lufimtse:  if it doesn't introduce new warnings inthe bundle use the later approach
Apr 28 11:55:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, So submit patch that uses "enable project specific settings"?
Apr 28 11:55:21 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ./update it
Apr 28 11:55:32 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: yes, if it introduces some additional warnings 
Apr 28 11:55:37 <akurtakov>	fix them too
Apr 28 11:55:40 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok.
Apr 28 12:08:15 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ok, no warnings/errors: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/96045/
Apr 28 12:08:17 <lufimtse>	just that one change
Apr 28 12:08:21 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, ready for review.
Apr 28 12:26:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, Hmm, I found that the warning goes away, but instead we have a run time error
Apr 28 12:26:16 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, and dark theme doesn't kick in again
Apr 28 12:26:37 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, one way around is to add "org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk," to swt's Manifest.mf, but that breaks cocoa
Apr 28 12:26:59 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to solve this, not sure why nobody picked up on this earlier?
Apr 28 12:27:49 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: I think your child setup is misbehaving
Apr 28 12:28:00 <akurtakov>	do you have the smth.di bundle activated?
Apr 28 12:31:05 <lufimtse>	smth.di?
Apr 28 12:31:58 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I have all of eclipse.platform.ui, Text, JDT projects
Apr 28 12:32:00 <lufimtse>	in workspace
Apr 28 12:32:15 <lufimtse>	child eclipse is set to use all workspace plugins + target after
Apr 28 12:32:28 <lufimtse>	what is the smth.di ?
Apr 28 12:34:45 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: from target there is a bundle that ends at .di
Apr 28 12:34:51 <lufimtse>	lemme check
Apr 28 12:34:54 <akurtakov>	I can't remember the exact name
Apr 28 12:35:24 <lufimtse>	org.eclipse.e4.ui.di ?
Apr 28 12:35:26 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, 
Apr 28 12:36:08 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I have that enabled
Apr 28 12:39:35 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, oh I got something
Apr 28 12:40:53 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I had these two turned off to prevent duplicate methods showing up in call-hierarchy
Apr 28 12:40:53 <lufimtse>	http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1493397631.png
Apr 28 12:41:18 <lufimtse>	but that affected org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk
Apr 28 12:41:49 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, with them two enabled, stuff works again
Apr 28 12:42:07 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, I think I should probably submit revert patch for that options 
Apr 28 12:42:24 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, as the error was specific to my config afterall
Apr 28 13:04:04 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, patch: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/96053/
Apr 28 13:06:05 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: it's fine to have these settings
Apr 28 13:06:11 <akurtakov>	please abandon
Apr 28 13:06:14 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, hmmm
Apr 28 13:06:27 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, actually, there is a problem with them
Apr 28 13:06:35 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, that I didn't notice originally
Apr 28 13:06:45 <akurtakov>	I tested them too
Apr 28 13:06:48 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, with error, you notice the issue at compile time
Apr 28 13:06:58 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, without the error, it prints the issue at run time
Apr 28 13:07:06 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, and it doesn't work at run time
Apr 28 13:07:14 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, the setting just delays the issue
Apr 28 13:07:22 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, but I didn't see it at the time
Apr 28 13:07:31 <lufimtse>	akurtakov, so we do need to revert I think
Apr 28 13:07:43 <akurtakov>	lufimtse: no revert 
Apr 28 13:07:48 <akurtakov>	it's fine that way
Apr 28 13:07:53 <akurtakov>	let's stop the noise
Apr 28 13:07:55 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 28 13:15:00 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: phew, ant 1.10.1 is in
Apr 28 13:15:34 <rgrunber>	:) it's been in for a while.. and will make m7.. last bunch of changes have been for things like licensing/minor annoyances..
Apr 28 13:16:02 *	rgrunber was surprised that the extra '.' causes test failures on platform side.
Apr 28 13:16:29 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: well, we got first build today 
Apr 28 13:16:35 <akurtakov>	and tests are not finished yet

May 01 11:42:30 <rgrunber>	seems to be it..
May 01 11:55:56 <rgrunber>	nboldt: did you get my draft script for installing a bunch of bundles + checking any unresolved bundles ?.. sent a link a while ago.
May 01 11:56:11 <nboldt>	rgrunber: yes, but had other things on fire last week
May 01 11:56:22 <nboldt>	it's in my "TODO when nothing is broken" pile
May 01 12:00:58 <rgrunber>	k, just an fyi, the reason i went with installing individual features is because the cli for eclipse has some limit on number of arguments so couldn't do it all at once.. and some features in aggregation simply didn't install due to some conflict or whatnot.. i figured better to have some fail individually.
May 01 12:02:03 <nboldt>	so you install incrementally, rather than in a single massive operation?
May 01 12:02:21 <nboldt>	that actually might be good -- sometimes the big reactor will hide problems
May 01 12:03:16 <rgrunber>	yeah.. could probably check exit code of individual feature install and report what failed to install.
May 01 12:05:26 <rgrunber>	so i actually don't see org.slfj.api 1.7.10 even in the devstudio product master..
May 02 08:26:43 <mbooth>	akurtakov: Something exciting for you: https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=19367799
May 02 08:27:01 <mbooth>	Full 32-bit arm build is less than 2 hours :-o
May 02 08:27:23 <akurtakov>	mbooth: ah, nice :)
May 02 08:54:17 <scela>	akurtakov: did you know about https://twitter.com/EclipseJavaIDE/status/859389412479614977 ?
May 02 08:54:23 <scela>	akurtakov: i didn't. great one from noopur.
May 02 08:54:58 <akurtakov>	nope :)
May 02 08:57:27 <scela>	akurtakov: super useful for me
May 02 09:32:28 <scela>	mistria: welcome. report time :)
May 02 10:11:49 <rgrunber>	akurtakov: according to https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12549#c7, junit 5 is no longer destined for Oxygen ?
May 02 10:41:50 <akurtakov>	rgrunber: well, ti will sit in separately installable feature patch
May 02 10:41:58 <akurtakov>	but ideally should be built with oxygen proper
May 02 12:27:22 <nboldt>	jjohnstn: hey, so the new 2.3.0 docker you pointed me to yesterday requires a whole (older) set of requirements than what's in Neon.3. for example... jnr.unixsocket 0.5 (from 2015) instead of com.github.jnr.unixsocket 0.12.0 (2016)
May 02 12:27:44 <rgrunber>	nboldt: yes, because it's a downgrade of the docker-client stack.
May 02 12:28:14 <nboldt>	ah, so this is expected and I have to iterate through all these renamed /downgraded artifacts? 
May 02 12:28:39 <nboldt>	are the older artifacts also on the new Neon.3b site? 
May 02 12:28:55 <nboldt>	that is, not your docker respin but a respin of the Neon.3 site itself?
May 02 12:29:11 <nboldt>	worried that these deps won't be found by a generic Neon.3b user
May 02 12:29:15 <rgrunber>	nboldt: the older artifacts are on that site http://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools/update-docker-neon3respinb/plugins/?d
May 02 12:29:33 <nboldt>	sure but is that aggregated into the Neon.3 site as well?
May 02 12:29:39 <rgrunber>	ahh.. they should be in the aggregation as well.
May 02 12:30:44 <nboldt>	yeah, seems that way
May 02 12:30:57 <nboldt>	so I'm replacing the 0.12 stuff with their 0.5 counterparts... 
May 02 12:30:59 <nboldt>	$ find . -name "*jnr*_0.5*.jar"

May 02 12:31:10 <nboldt>	fun :(
May 02 12:31:14 <rgrunber>	i think the new and old content is there, yeah..
May 02 12:32:32 <rgrunber>	you could try looking for the artifact in http://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools/update-docker-neon3respinb/plugins/?d as that'd tell you the right one to use
May 02 12:33:03 <nboldt>	yeah that's what I'm doing. just sucks that this is a "one failure at a time" verification process
May 02 12:33:17 <nboldt>	and that the artifacts are renamed (adding com.github. prefix)
