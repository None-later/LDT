Feb 16 13:21:22 <lufimtse>	I like the team battle thing. I wonder if there are strategies.
Feb 16 13:21:44 <lufimtse>	Like I was just casually floating around and maybe defend the edge if you were off edge
Feb 16 13:21:46 <hukhan>	Yeah, like at one point you actually saved me
Feb 16 13:21:51 <lufimtse>	but there are probably more effective tactics
Feb 16 13:22:02 <lufimtse>	you mean by the accidental forward air ha ha
Feb 16 13:22:07 <hukhan>	Yeah hahaha
Feb 16 13:22:16 <hukhan>	I was flying right, you hit me, and sent me left with a lower force
Feb 16 13:22:23 <lufimtse>	ha ha
Feb 16 13:22:24 <hukhan>	I could save you with my bombs LOL 
Feb 16 13:27:21 <lufimtse>	yea
Feb 16 13:27:24 <lufimtse>	comming to think of it.
Feb 16 13:27:53 <lufimtse>	We should advertise team play more. If it catches on, it'd be interesting to view strategies on it.
Feb 16 13:28:39 <hukhan>	I definitely think it's really fun, it's just not often where we have so many playing at once
Feb 16 13:28:48 <hukhan>	although, 2v2's might be possible on a frequent basis
