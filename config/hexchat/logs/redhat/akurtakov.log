[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@vpn1-5-74.ams2.redhat.com]
Jul 25 17:56:34 <lufimtse>	you still around I see
Jul 25 17:56:41 <akurtakov>	yup
Jul 25 17:56:46 <akurtakov>	more like 
Jul 25 17:56:48 <akurtakov>	I'm back :)
Jul 25 17:57:06 <lufimtse>	I see, you use the css in the GtkInspector?
Jul 25 17:57:26 <akurtakov>	I do yes :)
Jul 25 17:57:36 <akurtakov>	but in general
Jul 25 17:57:44 <akurtakov>	don't introduce these needless variables
Jul 25 17:57:49 <lufimtse>	I'm a little bit oppose to duplicate css strings thou.
Jul 25 17:57:54 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Jul 25 17:58:04 <akurtakov>	this is what gtk devs recommend
Jul 25 17:58:26 <akurtakov>	have separate css per gtk version
Jul 25 17:59:22 <akurtakov>	see mclassen comment here https://blogs.gnome.org/mclasen/2015/11/20/a-gtk-update/
Jul 25 17:59:33 <lufimtse>	Lemme read.
Jul 25 17:59:35 <akurtakov>	second comment
Jul 25 18:00:15 <akurtakov>	I plan on stripping this css into gtk3.18.css and gtk3.20.css files
Jul 25 18:00:32 <akurtakov>	and load whichever is needed based on the version we run on
Jul 25 18:01:31 <lufimtse>	that makes sense
Jul 25 18:01:52 <akurtakov>	it would be more like gtk3.18.css and gtk.css :)
Jul 25 18:02:32 <akurtakov>	but duplication of the css in a string is better than introducing tons of local variables for the sake of not duplicating
Jul 25 18:02:49 <akurtakov>	mind you that a single string will be interned and that's it
Jul 25 18:03:24 <akurtakov>	with local variables there will be copies for each variable
Jul 25 18:03:42 <akurtakov>	as intern would not happen due to different content of each variable
Jul 25 18:04:15 <lufimtse>	meh, I see that folks might not notice the subtle difference in "-gtk-key-bindings" vs "gtk-key-bindings" if we throw everything into a file. But meh... 
Jul 25 18:04:24 <lufimtse>	performance is not so much on my mind.
Jul 25 18:04:43 <akurtakov>	it should be the first thing on your mind when working on swt :)
Jul 25 18:05:12 <akurtakov>	every bit counts here
Jul 25 18:05:59 <akurtakov>	even this css was extracted that way to load it globally to not apply parts of it everytime given widget is created
Jul 25 18:07:24 <akurtakov>	keep in mind that one of the undisputable advantages of Eclipse is the native performance UI toolkit 
Jul 25 18:07:43 <akurtakov>	something that intellij/netbeans can't achieve
Jul 25 18:08:23 <akurtakov>	we should not allow this advantage to be lost for readability sake
Jul 25 18:08:41 <akurtakov>	also thinking from end user POV
Jul 25 18:09:05 <akurtakov>	how performant toolkit is is more important than how readable code is
Jul 25 18:09:24 <lufimtse>	Well
Jul 25 18:09:26 <akurtakov>	and last "readable" is personal opinion in some cases like this one
Jul 25 18:09:35 <lufimtse>	sec
Jul 25 18:11:07 <akurtakov>	also think from other apps pov - rssowl, vuze....
Jul 25 18:11:39 <akurtakov>	stuff like http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/commit/?id=520267783601ade56440e29bd1a9d2c726acf627 makes big difference when writing file browser type of app
Jul 25 18:13:03 <akurtakov>	am I too verbose :)
Jul 25 18:13:24 <lufimtse>	Well, if you really want the css string musched together we can do that. But just as a note, I took a course on advance Operating systems where they got us to do benchmarking on CPU cycle level. A native call is indeed very expensive, on the order of 30,000+ cycles, but a string construction is like 50 cpu cycles.
Jul 25 18:13:40 <lufimtse>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38295391/how-many-cpu-cycles-an-object-creation-takes-in-java
Jul 25 18:14:05 <lufimtse>	If we move things into a file, that would kill any performance benifit from constructing stings.
Jul 25 18:14:10 <lufimtse>	but would indeed be more clean
Jul 25 18:14:25 <lufimtse>	meh
Jul 25 18:14:43 <lufimtse>	50cpu cycles translates to around 5ns on a 2.4 ghz
Jul 25 18:14:44 <lufimtse>	ps
Jul 25 18:14:45 <lufimtse>	pc
Jul 25 18:15:14 <lufimtse>	meh
Jul 25 18:15:31 <lufimtse>	ok, getting late over here, would you mind if I move the thing back into a string tomorrow?
Jul 25 18:15:43 <akurtakov>	the file will be loaded already as it will be in the jar
Jul 25 18:15:52 <akurtakov>	not at all
Jul 25 18:16:24 <lufimtse>	how about file + comment in the file about the -gtk-bindings-keys business ^__^
Jul 25 18:17:09 <akurtakov>	and comment about GtkToolbar vs toolbar
Jul 25 18:17:26 <akurtakov>	.undershoot vs scrolledwindow undershoot 
Jul 25 18:17:28 <akurtakov>	and etc.
Jul 25 18:17:41 <akurtakov>	it's just a different css file - we have to admit it :)
Jul 25 18:17:50 <lufimtse>	meh
Jul 25 18:18:16 <akurtakov>	it's not ideal world :)
Jul 25 18:18:22 <lufimtse>	X-D
Jul 25 18:18:39 <lufimtse>	ok ok, I'll musch into a string tomorrow if that's ok with u.
Jul 25 18:18:46 <akurtakov>	sure
Jul 25 18:19:57 <akurtakov>	btw, what's "musch" ?
Jul 25 18:20:33 <lufimtse>	mix
Jul 25 18:20:35 <lufimtse>	put together
Jul 25 18:20:40 <lufimtse>	like when you mix ingredients in a bowl
Jul 25 18:20:44 <lufimtse>	musch
Jul 25 18:20:49 <akurtakov>	ah, ok 
Jul 25 18:21:00 <akurtakov>	never heard it before and you used it twice :)
Jul 25 18:21:13 <lufimtse>	it's one of those things people say but never write much
Jul 25 18:21:55 <lufimtse>	ok, I"m off, have a nice one ^__^

[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@vpn1-4-226.ams2.redhat.com]
Jul 26 12:53:34 <akurtakov>	some quotes http://izquotes.com/quotes-pictures/quote-perfection-is-achieved-not-when-there-is-nothing-more-to-add-but-when-there-is-nothing-left-to-antoine-de-saint-exupery-161537.jpg
Jul 26 12:54:01 <akurtakov>	http://startupquotes.startupvitamins.com/post/91064157142/a-user-interface-is-like-a-joke-if-you-have-to
Jul 26 12:54:22 <akurtakov>	think about these things when the idea to add smth comes :)
Jul 26 12:54:58 <lufimtse>	the maven thing seems kinda heavy
Jul 26 12:55:28 <lufimtse>	I've executed:  mvn clean verify -Dnative=gtk.linux.x86 -Pbuild-individual-bundles 
Jul 26 12:55:31 <lufimtse>	in the binary repo
Jul 26 12:55:34 <lufimtse>	it's doing it's thing
Jul 26 12:55:43 <lufimtse>	it's taking a long time
Jul 26 12:55:58 <lufimtse>	the idea with build script is local rebuild, not so much eclipse rebuild
Jul 26 12:55:58 <akurtakov>	well, you can cd to the fragment and do it there 
Jul 26 12:56:02 <akurtakov>	will take far less
Jul 26 12:56:20 <lufimtse>	what do you mean by fragment?
Jul 26 12:56:49 <akurtakov>	cd bundles/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_64 :)
Jul 26 12:56:57 <lufimtse>	lemme try
Jul 26 12:58:32 <lufimtse>	I did the maven command, it took a while bu finished succesfully. The *.so files are not there, are they put somewhere else?
Jul 26 13:02:19 <lufimtse>	The pictures are inspiring, but following that logic one would be using vim as oppose to Eclipse ^__^''
Jul 26 13:02:42 <akurtakov>	hmm, so files are there for me
Jul 26 13:02:47 <lufimtse>	you mean *.so?
Jul 26 13:02:52 <akurtakov>	yes
Jul 26 13:03:11 <akurtakov>	mvn clean verify -Pbuild-individual-bundles -Dnative=gtk.linux.x86_64
Jul 26 13:03:29 <akurtakov>	http://paste.fedoraproject.org/395892/69552599/
Jul 26 13:03:38 <akurtakov>	note the just generated *.so file
Jul 26 13:04:31 <lufimtse>	that command up there is slightly different from the one in Eclipse chat. That one seems to work.
Jul 26 13:05:04 <akurtakov>	sorry, written by memory 
Jul 26 13:05:18 <akurtakov>	execed from bash history :)
Jul 26 13:06:43 <akurtakov>	I'm opposing to adding more things cause there is so much things only one person uses
Jul 26 13:07:03 <akurtakov>	e.g. do you use SWT_FATAL_WARNING you added?
Jul 26 13:07:46 <akurtakov>	and most of the time for very short period
Jul 26 13:08:47 <lufimtse>	We used the warnings things once or twice to hunt down a warning. I guess not that often
Jul 26 13:08:58 <lufimtse>	the maven thing is nice, just a bit slow I guess
Jul 26 13:09:32 <lufimtse>	~15 secs (without clean/verify), where as the build script does it in under 1 second
Jul 26 13:09:55 <lufimtse>	but I guess maven makes it redundant to add another script into root then
Jul 26 13:10:20 <lufimtse>	People who want to have things faster could use build.sh directly
Jul 26 13:10:34 <lufimtse>	interesting maven command, never knew about it
Jul 26 13:10:35 <akurtakov>	yup, it's not the most optimal way but it's generally usable for multiple things
Jul 26 13:11:22 <akurtakov>	bonus point for using it during development
Jul 26 13:11:41 <akurtakov>	when things get to releng (Mat) we know that the stuff works
Jul 26 13:12:11 <akurtakov>	which wasn't the case before support for that was added and whoever was rebasing platform was unbreaking the build for weeks
Jul 26 13:13:20 <akurtakov>	this makes me think - have you ever done any rpm work ?
Jul 26 13:13:54 <akurtakov>	it's a mind opener why "creative" releng is bad 
Jul 26 13:14:29 <akurtakov>	as a permanent member of the team you should be ready to act on such tasks
Jul 26 13:14:40 <akurtakov>	will get back to that soon :)
Jul 26 13:15:06 <lufimtse>	I haven't but keep me posted
Jul 26 13:15:11 <lufimtse>	thanks for maven info
Jul 26 13:15:28 <akurtakov>	well, you will be officially included in the Neon.1 packaging fest :)
Jul 26 13:16:24 <lufimtse>	X-D! yay
Jul 26 13:17:08 <akurtakov>	if looking for improvements to the build speed
Jul 26 13:17:18 <akurtakov>	it copies the sources twice
Jul 26 13:17:34 <akurtakov>	and runs the suboptimal 64to32 task
Jul 26 13:17:55 <akurtakov>	that would benefit everyone if improved
Jul 26 13:18:12 <akurtakov>	and maybe even migrating from rhino to nashhorn
Jul 26 13:18:13 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Jul 26 13:18:23 <lufimtse>	what is the 64 to 32 task
Jul 26 13:18:54 <lufimtse>	the build.sh runs in like .5 second or less, where as mvn does 15 seconds, there seems to be a magnitude difference?
Jul 26 13:19:00 <lufimtse>	is that because of 64 to 32 ?
Jul 26 13:19:52 <akurtakov>	maven does build both gtk3 and 2 (just to make sure you compare apple to apple)
Jul 26 13:20:11 <akurtakov>	but it also recompiles the java sources  which build.sh doesn't do
Jul 26 13:20:32 <akurtakov>	and also generates jar in target for direct usage 
Jul 26 13:20:35 <akurtakov>	and etc.
Jul 26 13:20:40 <lufimtse>	the .5 reference was to ./build.sh -gtk-all which compiles both btw
Jul 26 13:20:46 <lufimtse>	and does clean in between
Jul 26 13:20:57 <lufimtse>	is there a way to exclude java compilation from maven?
Jul 26 13:21:01 <lufimtse>	(just wondering..)
Jul 26 13:21:11 <akurtakov>	nope
Jul 26 13:21:15 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 26 13:21:18 <akurtakov>	in buildSWT.xml
Jul 26 13:21:30 <akurtakov>	there is replace.32.to.64 and replace64.to32
Jul 26 13:21:33 <lufimtse>	btw, the maven thing works with the latest ./build.sh fixes.
Jul 26 13:21:41 <lufimtse>	prints green colouring thou.... 
Jul 26 13:21:43 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Jul 26 13:21:50 <akurtakov>	I know :) tested it yesterday :0
Jul 26 13:22:17 <akurtakov>	I'm really cautious when touching these places
Jul 26 13:22:26 <lufimtse>	I know what you mean
Jul 26 13:22:26 <akurtakov>	you never know what IBM/others use
Jul 26 13:23:08 <lufimtse>	I suppose they could test it on their build machines?
Jul 26 13:24:56 <akurtakov>	yeah, if only Sravan wasn't taking David W. work
Jul 26 13:25:15 <akurtakov>	and Arun has some personal stuff to deal with so not working lately
Jul 26 13:25:15 <lufimtse>	He's quite busy?
Jul 26 13:25:22 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 26 13:25:24 <lufimtse>	hmm

Jul 26 13:26:48 <akurtakov>	all pending on Sravan 
Jul 26 13:27:06 <akurtakov>	and he is in charge for all builders
Jul 26 13:27:11 <lufimtse>	I see.
Jul 26 13:27:21 <akurtakov>	even updating AIX to have GTK 2.24 on it and etc.
Jul 26 13:27:46 <lufimtse>	on the bright side: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77357/  << hudson builds successfully
Jul 26 13:28:05 <lufimtse>	When I was adding functionality, I was checking for backwards support with many shells
Jul 26 13:28:16 <lufimtse>	cross-platform colouring etc... 
Jul 26 13:28:45 <lufimtse>	The colouring is quite nice, but at the end of the day I could remove it if it get's the patch in quicker
Jul 26 13:28:56 <akurtakov>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=498429
Jul 26 13:28:59 <lufimtse>	and instead just have markers like "---" and "***" ...
Jul 26 13:29:08 <akurtakov>	let's keep it for now
Jul 26 13:29:19 <akurtakov>	I'll definetely try to push it today
Jul 26 13:29:38 <akurtakov>	with some jni change right after it to test the native builders don't screw
Jul 26 13:29:51 <lufimtse>	kk
Jul 26 13:30:02 <akurtakov>	dinner time now
Jul 26 13:30:24 <akurtakov>	btw, moving to GTK 2.24 is like updating half the world
Jul 26 13:30:59 <akurtakov>	working with AIX devs to get gtk 2.24 there, update eclipse.org infra, fix tests, change build scripts ...........
Jul 26 13:32:50 <lufimtse>	X-D lols.
Jul 26 13:33:12 <lufimtse>	After dinner: btw, is 2.18 evil>?
Jul 26 13:33:25 <akurtakov>	yes
Jul 26 13:33:44 <akurtakov>	there is no machine with gtk 2.18 and 3.x 
Jul 26 13:34:10 <akurtakov>	meaning that different so files have to be build on different machines
Jul 26 13:34:23 <akurtakov>	which is not what eclipse webmaster wants
Jul 26 13:34:37 <akurtakov>	which prevents moving builder to smth we can influence
Jul 26 13:34:47 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 26 13:34:59 <akurtakov>	and building against custom compiled gtk is no-go
Jul 26 13:35:07 <akurtakov>	not to mention that dropping 2.18
Jul 26 13:35:25 <akurtakov>	would allow us to remove the dep on XRender 
Jul 26 13:35:45 <akurtakov>	aka open the door for wayland builds without X11 dep
Jul 26 13:35:49 <akurtakov>	and I can continue :)
Jul 26 13:35:55 <akurtakov>	gdk drawing also 
Jul 26 13:36:09 <akurtakov>	anyway, dinner really
Jul 26 13:39:37 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 26 13:39:39 <lufimtse>	interesting.
Jul 26 13:39:45 <lufimtse>	enjoy
Jul 26 15:52:38 <lufimtse>	u still around?
Jul 26 15:52:45 <akurtakov>	yes
Jul 26 15:53:03 <lufimtse>	just curious, is Eclipse+GTK2 officially in "maintenance" mode?
Jul 26 15:53:06 <lufimtse>	like the gtk2 part
Jul 26 15:53:28 <lufimtse>	I.e, would that imply no new features in that combo?
Jul 26 15:53:33 <lufimtse>	just fix bugs
Jul 26 15:53:46 <akurtakov>	this is the message I send on Red Hat behalf
Jul 26 15:53:59 <akurtakov>	definetely if adding new features
Jul 26 15:54:05 <akurtakov>	we are not interested in gtk2
Jul 26 15:54:19 <akurtakov>	e.g. eric's alpha work will be gtk3 only and etc.
Jul 26 15:54:25 <lufimtse>	I'm just reading Markus's comment
Jul 26 15:54:37 <akurtakov>	if it's in the shared code we will not ifdef gtk2
Jul 26 15:54:46 <akurtakov>	but otherwise fixes for gtk3 only from our team
Jul 26 15:54:57 <akurtakov>	new one?
Jul 26 15:55:02 <lufimtse>	na
Jul 26 15:55:02 <akurtakov>	or the one I replied to?
Jul 26 15:55:07 <lufimtse>	the one u replied to. 
Jul 26 15:55:43 <akurtakov>	I have sent the message multiple times that we are not going to spend time on gtk2
Jul 26 16:01:15 <lufimtse>	was thinking of +1 on grounds that we no longer add new features to gtk2
Jul 26 16:01:36 <lufimtse>	then wanted to check with you if we are in maintenance mode
Jul 26 16:01:58 <akurtakov>	well better to play the bad cop/good cop sometimes
Jul 26 16:02:04 <akurtakov>	let me be the bad one this time
Jul 26 16:06:44 <akurtakov>	btw, do you mind if I remove the CAUTION section
Jul 26 16:07:30 <akurtakov>	I don't like the idea of this warning message when you know exactly what you do

Jul 26 16:12:46 <akurtakov>	I'll reduce the output and commit it
Jul 26 16:13:35 <lufimtse>	that's ok
Jul 26 16:13:43 <lufimtse>	was thinking of removing it also
Jul 26 16:13:51 <lufimtse>	considering maven...
Jul 26 16:14:13 <akurtakov>	there is also the double OS/ARCH announcement first and fifth line
Jul 26 16:14:23 <lufimtse>	hmmm

Jul 26 16:15:17 <akurtakov>	1 and 5 in this paste
Jul 26 16:16:49 <lufimtse>	I guess that's just info on which GTK is being build. I could compress it into a single line?
Jul 26 16:16:53 <lufimtse>	if you give me 10 mins
Jul 26 16:17:04 <akurtakov>	nah, I'm on it 
Jul 26 16:17:27 <lufimtse>	I.e, like put it into a variable and use it in both build places... 
Jul 26 16:17:45 <akurtakov>	it's about the output
Jul 26 16:17:54 <akurtakov>	the two lines contain exactly the same info
Jul 26 16:18:18 <lufimtse>	how so?
Jul 26 16:18:25 <lufimtse>	one says architecture, one says gtk2/gtk3
Jul 26 16:18:33 <lufimtse>	oh

Jul 26 16:22:30 <akurtakov>	I'll push it now
Jul 26 16:23:24 <lufimtse>	kk
Jul 26 16:25:19 <akurtakov>	assuming there is no further work planned you can close the bug :)
Jul 26 16:25:25 <akurtakov>	nice improvement
Jul 26 16:25:33 <lufimtse>	well
Jul 26 16:25:37 <lufimtse>	still gotta update wiki
Jul 26 16:25:51 <lufimtse>	let's keep bug open till then
Jul 26 16:25:56 <akurtakov>	ok
Jul 26 16:26:01 <lufimtse>	I'll post in bug about wiki update, then .... 
Jul 26 16:34:07 <akurtakov>	will this ever end https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77934/
Jul 26 16:34:49 <akurtakov>	I'm kind of tired of doing this stuff every time I look at a file
Jul 26 16:53:37 <lufimtse>	oh ^_^
Jul 26 16:53:41 <lufimtse>	I forgot to remove those
Jul 26 16:53:42 <lufimtse>	lols

Jul 27 14:02:01 <akurtakov>	I'm eager to test the webkit2 exec patch :0
Jul 27 14:02:35 <akurtakov>	sounds like smth that would help my local install using webkit2 :)
Jul 27 14:02:49 <lufimtse>	getting there
Jul 27 14:02:53 <lufimtse>	tidying up commit atm
Jul 27 14:03:09 <lufimtse>	It's a good idea to submit lots of little patches I think
Jul 27 14:03:28 <lufimtse>	I'm creating my own repo for bug snippets, as at the moment they're just too all over the place.
Jul 27 14:03:38 <lufimtse>	gimme 10 mins. 
Jul 27 14:06:18 <lufimtse>	Do you have any good way to tell if webkit1 or webkit2 is runnning?
Jul 27 14:06:28 <lufimtse>	I currently stuff a printline into WebKit.java
Jul 27 14:06:32 <lufimtse>	just after WEBKIT2
Jul 27 14:06:42 <lufimtse>	just kinda tedious to deal with it during commits
Jul 27 14:08:07 <akurtakov>	use the env variable
Jul 27 14:08:19 <lufimtse>	I mean like when you run a snippet
Jul 27 14:08:24 <lufimtse>	I want to verify it's on webkit2.
Jul 27 14:08:39 <lufimtse>	just to keep sane
Jul 27 14:09:08 <lufimtse>	atm I put a println after WEBKIT2 saying "Webkit2 has loaded"
Jul 27 14:09:16 <lufimtse>	but everytime I do a commit, I have to remote that println
Jul 27 14:09:19 <lufimtse>	and then put it back
Jul 27 14:09:19 <lufimtse>	meh
Jul 27 14:09:33 <lufimtse>	or have faith that snippet truly runs webkit2
Jul 27 14:09:58 <lufimtse>	normally in gtk inspector I can read Gtk version, would be nice to have something equivalent for webkit version
Jul 27 14:10:00 <lufimtse>	but meh.
Jul 27 14:10:10 <akurtakov>	http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/commit/?id=d087a6b7e24c09db8fa729b985383ba168fb4055
Jul 27 14:10:12 <akurtakov>	:)
Jul 27 14:10:42 <akurtakov>	so System.getenv("org.eclipse.swt.internal.webkitgtk.version") will give you the version 
Jul 27 14:10:54 <akurtakov>	but only after webkit has been initialized
Jul 27 14:11:27 <lufimtse>	sorta what I'm looking for I guess
Jul 27 14:11:41 <lufimtse>	you mean I can stuff that into snippet?
Jul 27 14:11:43 <lufimtse>	lemme try
Jul 27 14:11:47 <akurtakov>	yes
Jul 27 14:14:12 <lufimtse>	hmm, seems to return null for me.
Jul 27 14:14:19 <lufimtse>	do you happen to have a snippet that works with this?
Jul 27 14:14:39 <lufimtse>	I run that when a webkit widget has already been loaded.
Jul 27 14:47:30 <akurtakov>	works for the ide http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/commit/?id=0f0d8b4f63b7b569f675138bde11bc576f14d9b9
Jul 27 14:48:48 <lufimtse>	btw, the save actions keep changing imports
Jul 27 14:48:49 <lufimtse>	like: import org.eclipse.swt.internal.C;
Jul 27 14:48:52 <lufimtse>	to import org.eclipse.swt.internal.*
Jul 27 14:48:59 <lufimtse>	I guess we don't mind?
Jul 27 14:49:03 <akurtakov>	yup
Jul 27 14:49:06 <lufimtse>	kk
Jul 27 14:49:22 <akurtakov>	sooner or later it will modify everything :)
Jul 27 14:56:34 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 27 14:56:35 <lufimtse>	kk
Jul 27 14:56:38 <lufimtse>	https://github.com/LeoUfimtsev/swt.snippets/blob/master/swt.crossplatform.snippets/generic/browser/Snip_Browser_Javascript_execute.java
Jul 27 14:56:41 <lufimtse>	^^ snippet 
Jul 27 14:56:46 <lufimtse>	patch
Jul 27 14:56:46 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78014/
Jul 27 14:56:58 <lufimtse>	before patch, try running snippet in W2
Jul 27 14:57:05 <lufimtse>	buttons don't change background
Jul 27 14:57:09 <lufimtse>	then apply patch
Jul 27 14:57:16 <lufimtse>	then try snippet again. 
Jul 27 14:57:36 <lufimtse>	fyi, this is the repo I made: https://github.com/LeoUfimtsev/swt.snippets
Jul 27 14:57:40 <lufimtse>	for my future snippets
Jul 27 15:01:34 <lufimtse>	----
Jul 27 15:01:45 <lufimtse>	btw, thank you for snippet, that prints webkitgtk version
Jul 27 15:01:50 <lufimtse>	*thumbs up*
Jul 27 15:01:52 <lufimtse>	life is good.
Jul 27 15:33:30 <lufimtse>	---
Jul 27 15:33:38 <lufimtse>	I'm getting a strange error in swt.tests:
Jul 27 15:33:39 <lufimtse>	Access restriction: The field 'MozillaVersion.VERSION_XR1_9_2' is not API (restriction on required project 'org.eclipse.swt')
Jul 27 15:33:44 <lufimtse>	and other alike...
Jul 27 15:33:50 <lufimtse>	any ideas how to fix?
Jul 27 15:34:32 <akurtakov>	ignore :)
Jul 27 15:34:43 <lufimtse>	it only started today
Jul 27 15:34:47 <lufimtse>	hasn't happened before
Jul 27 15:34:49 <akurtakov>	hmm
Jul 27 15:34:57 <lufimtse>	i usually try to keep workspace problem fere
Jul 27 15:35:00 <lufimtse>	free*
Jul 27 15:35:17 <akurtakov>	even after restart of eclipse and rebuild workspace
Jul 27 15:35:19 <akurtakov>	?
Jul 27 15:36:43 <lufimtse>	ok, closing eclipse and opening worked wonders
Jul 27 15:36:51 <lufimtse>	X-D
Jul 27 15:37:07 <lufimtse>	one of those odd things..
Jul 27 15:39:04 <akurtakov>	I'll minimize your commit message :)
Jul 27 15:39:50 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 27 15:39:53 <lufimtse>	kinda long I guess
Jul 27 15:40:19 <lufimtse>	I can shorten it ?
Jul 27 15:40:25 <lufimtse>	you mean the URL part?
Jul 27 15:40:32 <akurtakov>	no
Jul 27 15:40:38 <akurtakov>	Part 1: (work in progress, but can be commited)
Jul 27 15:40:40 <akurtakov>	(The idea is to have more partial commits instead of one huge commit)
Jul 27 15:40:52 <akurtakov>	not related to the commit :)
Jul 27 15:40:58 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 27 15:41:04 <lufimtse>	good point
Jul 27 15:41:17 <lufimtse>	I guess those are better put into the comments
Jul 27 15:41:50 <akurtakov>	do you use git log ?
Jul 27 15:41:57 <lufimtse>	not much
Jul 27 15:42:04 <lufimtse>	I use the history view in eclipse
Jul 27 15:42:16 <akurtakov>	I do for preparing release notes :)
Jul 27 15:42:29 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 27 15:42:32 <akurtakov>	an explanation why I care for these things :)
Jul 27 15:45:30 <lufimtse>	The webkit work is quite demanding
Jul 27 15:45:34 <lufimtse>	phew
Jul 27 15:45:39 <lufimtse>	sometimes hard to stay focused
Jul 27 15:51:12 <akurtakov>	it's in :)
Jul 27 15:51:21 <akurtakov>	yeah, focusing is quite hard
Jul 27 15:51:30 <lufimtse>	nice nice
Jul 27 15:51:36 <akurtakov>	I almost gave up 
Jul 27 15:52:23 <akurtakov>	spending 3h on the phone today and talking about N-teen different things if smth needs deepdiving I'm just not left to do it
Jul 27 15:52:46 <lufimtse>	^__^
Jul 27 15:52:54 <akurtakov>	actually if I want to do real development I have to stop irc, not check mail and etc. to not be bothered
Jul 27 15:55:15 <lufimtse>	hmm, maybe I should focus more on getting one thing done at a time.
Jul 27 15:56:34 <akurtakov>	I don't give suggestion on "how" one to organize his workflow
Jul 27 15:56:44 <akurtakov>	usually it's strictly personal
Jul 27 15:56:56 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 27 15:57:04 <akurtakov>	what works for me would not for  you and vice-versa
Jul 27 15:57:08 <lufimtse>	I'm often curious to see other dev's workflows thou.
Jul 27 15:57:15 <lufimtse>	kinda pick up things as I go along.
Jul 27 15:59:55 <akurtakov>	my workflow - have clear goal - do whatever needed with whatever tool possible to achieve it :)
Jul 27 16:00:05 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 27 16:00:19 <lufimtse>	BTW, the browser tests are utterly slow (lots of odd 'wait' loops). Unless you know of a good reason why, I wanna speed them up a bit.
Jul 27 16:00:34 <lufimtse>	unless you know of a good reason why they are so slow*
Jul 27 16:00:56 <lufimtse>	Like when I make a change, running junits takes for evea
Jul 27 16:01:45 <akurtakov>	honestly I never understood these tests
Jul 27 16:01:55 <akurtakov>	what I know is that these are the most fragile tests :)
Jul 27 16:02:21 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 27 16:02:23 <akurtakov>	if you do major changes - be ready to react on every builder update :)
Jul 27 16:02:40 <lufimtse>	How do I check builder logs
Jul 27 16:02:56 <akurtakov>	http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/N20160726-2000/
Jul 27 16:03:01 <akurtakov>	everything is there
Jul 27 16:03:04 <akurtakov>	from the huge log
Jul 27 16:03:44 <akurtakov>	down to table test results like http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/N20160726-2000/testresults/html/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests_ep47N-unit-lin64_linux.gtk.x86_64_8.0.html
Jul 27 16:04:30 <akurtakov>	or the individual textual output http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/N20160726-2000/logs.php#console
Jul 27 16:04:44 <akurtakov>	it takes a bit of time to find your way 
Jul 27 16:05:02 <akurtakov>	but there are enough battles for me to try improving that :)
Jul 27 16:05:16 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 27 16:06:30 <akurtakov>	so will you try to make the async to sync onthe C side or Java side?
Jul 27 16:06:41 <lufimtse>	well
Jul 27 16:06:47 <lufimtse>	thought in progress
Jul 27 16:06:56 <lufimtse>	Sami did it on the java side
Jul 27 16:06:58 <lufimtse>	via callback
Jul 27 16:07:07 <lufimtse>	and a hashmap with counters.
Jul 27 16:07:12 <akurtakov>	would you please point me to it?
Jul 27 16:07:28 <lufimtse>	Sec
Jul 27 16:07:49 <lufimtse>	So:...
Jul 27 16:08:02 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/23416/16/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT+WebKit/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/browser/WebKit.java
Jul 27 16:08:16 <lufimtse>	private static HashMap<Integer, Long> jsResults = new HashMap<Integer, Long>();
Jul 27 16:08:16 <lufimtse>	private static int jsCounter = 0;
Jul 27 16:08:26 <lufimtse>		private static Callback executeJavaScriptFinishedCallback;
Jul 27 16:08:31 <lufimtse>		executeJavaScriptFinishedCallback = new Callback(WebKit.class, "executeJavaScriptFinishedCallback", 3);
Jul 27 16:08:35 <lufimtse>	The the actual callback:
Jul 27 16:08:40 <lufimtse>	@SuppressWarnings("unused")
Jul 27 16:08:40 <lufimtse>	private static long /*int*/ executeJavaScriptFinishedCallback (long /*int*/ source_object, long /*int*/ res, long /*int*/ user_data){
Jul 27 16:08:40 <lufimtse>		long /*int*/[] error = new long /*int*/[1];
Jul 27 16:08:40 <lufimtse>		long /*int*/ result = OS.g_dbus_proxy_call_finish (dbus_proxy, res, error); // << I may have to hack this to be more like native result getter.
Jul 27 16:08:40 <lufimtse>		int counter = (int) user_data;
Jul 27 16:08:40 <lufimtse>		if (error[0] != 0){
Jul 27 16:08:40 <lufimtse>			SWT.error(SWT.ERROR_IO, new Throwable(Converter.getString(OS.g_error_get_message(error[0]))));
Jul 27 16:08:40 <lufimtse>			result = 0;
Jul 27 16:08:40 <lufimtse>		}
Jul 27 16:08:40 <lufimtse>		jsResults.put(counter, (long)result);  // Stuff is inserted into a counter, there is probably a spin-lock checking this counter's result somewhere...
Jul 27 16:08:40 <lufimtse>		return 0;
Jul 27 16:08:40 <lufimtse>	}
Jul 27 16:08:55 <lufimtse>	Then 
Jul 27 16:09:02 <lufimtse>	For the JS, he loops
Jul 27 16:09:08 <lufimtse>	till callback puts something back into hashtable
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>	:
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>	private boolean webkit_extension_execute_script (long pageId, String script, String url){
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		long /*int*/ args[] = { OS.g_variant_new_uint64(pageId),
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>				OS.g_variant_new_string (Converter.wcsToMbcs(null, script, true)),
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>				OS.g_variant_new_string (Converter.wcsToMbcs(null, url, true))};
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		final long /*int*/ argsTuple = OS.g_variant_new_tuple(args, args.length);
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		int currentCounter = jsCounter++;
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		OS.g_dbus_proxy_call (dbus_proxy,
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>				Converter.wcsToMbcs(null,"webkit_extension_execute_script", true),
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>				argsTuple, OS.G_DBUS_CALL_FLAGS_NO_AUTO_START, -1, 0, executeJavaScriptFinishedCallback.getAddress(),currentCounter);
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		// The following is a workaround for the fact that g_dbus_proxy_call_sync
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		// blocks until it is timed-out and returns a failure.
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		// Keep iterating through the event loop until our JavaScript call has finished
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		// executing, failed, or timed-out.
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		Display display = this.browser.getDisplay();
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		while (!display.isDisposed() && jsResults.get(currentCounter) == null) {
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>			if (!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep();
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		}
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		long result = jsResults.remove(currentCounter);
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		if (result == 0){
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>			return false;
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		}
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>		return (Boolean) ((Object[])GVariantConverter.convertGVariantToJava((long /*int*/ )result))[0];
Jul 27 16:09:09 <lufimtse>	}
Jul 27 16:09:20 <lufimtse>	----------
Jul 27 16:09:31 <lufimtse>	i.e, for every new call, he adds something to counter
Jul 27 16:09:49 <lufimtse>	then loops on that item's value till it's filled by callback.
Jul 27 16:10:02 <lufimtse>	i.e, it's a basic spin-lock of sort.
Jul 27 16:10:23 <lufimtse>	mind you the above also has DBus and all that, which is not really needed anymore 
Jul 27 16:10:33 <akurtakov>	yeah, I see that
Jul 27 16:10:54 <akurtakov>	which one would be simpler/more readable option for you?
Jul 27 16:11:04 <lufimtse>	hmmmm
Jul 27 16:12:19 <lufimtse>	is SWT single threaded?
Jul 27 16:12:22 <lufimtse>	well
Jul 27 16:12:28 <lufimtse>	there is the display.async
Jul 27 16:12:29 <lufimtse>	so I gues snot
Jul 27 16:12:35 <lufimtse>	guess not*
Jul 27 16:12:39 <lufimtse>	so we need sync logic
Jul 27 16:12:45 <lufimtse>	java has nice atomic structures
Jul 27 16:12:56 <lufimtse>	atomic hashmaps... 
Jul 27 16:13:08 <lufimtse>	doing the same thing in C might get hairy
Jul 27 16:13:12 <lufimtse>	with plocks and all
Jul 27 16:13:27 <akurtakov>	hmm, not GTask ?
Jul 27 16:13:36 <lufimtse>	GTask? Lemme read.
Jul 27 16:13:45 <akurtakov>	https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GTask.html
Jul 27 16:15:48 <lufimtse>	Essentially, what it comes down to is that there may be multiple JS calls (ex if you have two or more webkit widgets), and I need to match up a JS callback with it's original caller.
Jul 27 16:15:48 <akurtakov>	or the underlying https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GSimpleAsyncResult.html 
Jul 27 16:16:01 <lufimtse>	I'm kinda thinking about how to do that... 
Jul 27 16:16:04 <lufimtse>	best... 
Jul 27 16:16:24 <lufimtse>	u don't happen to know if we do that somewhere in swt already?
Jul 27 16:16:42 <akurtakov>	can't think of a place
Jul 27 16:17:32 <akurtakov>	btw, if you do it on the C side
Jul 27 16:17:52 <akurtakov>	you shouldn't need to match callback with caller
Jul 27 16:18:07 <akurtakov>	as you would have pointer to it
Jul 27 16:18:10 <lufimtse>	is that so?
Jul 27 16:18:12 <lufimtse>	hmm
Jul 27 16:18:14 <lufimtse>	thinking
Jul 27 16:19:00 <lufimtse>	is there a way to create a function dynamically in C from within a function?
Jul 27 16:19:11 <lufimtse>	I may be missing understading of dynamic functions in C, gotta read up on it.
Jul 27 16:19:14 <lufimtse>	interesting line of thought
Jul 27 16:19:16 <akurtakov>	no
Jul 27 16:20:01 <akurtakov>	I'm thinking of 
Jul 27 16:20:02 <akurtakov>	swt_webkit_web_view_run_javascript () 
Jul 27 16:20:04 <akurtakov>	swt_webkit_web_view_run_javascript_callback()
Jul 27 16:21:00 <akurtakov>	if in the former you call webkit_web_view_run_javascript passing the callback 
Jul 27 16:21:36 <akurtakov>	and wait until the callback returns
Jul 27 16:21:57 <lufimtse>	suppose you have multiple JS invocations
Jul 27 16:21:58 <lufimtse>	A
Jul 27 16:21:59 <lufimtse>	B
Jul 27 16:22:02 <lufimtse>	A runs first
Jul 27 16:22:05 <lufimtse>	then B runs,
Jul 27 16:22:05 <akurtakov>	you would be in the same context which no other jni call will interfere with
Jul 27 16:22:20 <lufimtse>	..
Jul 27 16:22:21 <lufimtse>	hmm
Jul 27 16:22:28 <lufimtse>	you mean block till JS returns?
Jul 27 16:22:32 <akurtakov>	yes
Jul 27 16:22:36 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Jul 27 16:22:39 <lufimtse>	that makes sense
Jul 27 16:22:40 <akurtakov>	as if it's sync one
Jul 27 16:22:58 <lufimtse>	haven't thought about it that way, but now that you're saing it
Jul 27 16:23:04 <lufimtse>	in C that's the case
Jul 27 16:23:10 <lufimtse>	nothing to block... 
Jul 27 16:23:15 <lufimtse>	nothing to interrupt*
Jul 27 16:23:26 <lufimtse>	not a bad idea actually
Jul 27 16:23:30 <akurtakov>	yes, block vs. map/sync
Jul 27 16:23:43 <lufimtse>	the map/sync kinda feels messy
Jul 27 16:23:48 <lufimtse>	block probably better
Jul 27 16:23:56 <lufimtse>	since it's block on java side any way
Jul 27 16:24:42 <lufimtse>	I guess there are no concurrent JNI calls?
Jul 27 16:24:58 <akurtakov>	not from swt side
Jul 27 16:25:04 <lufimtse>	ah yea, we have the locking logic
Jul 27 16:25:08 <lufimtse>	in OS.java
Jul 27 16:25:17 <akurtakov>	the thread calling jni is single one
Jul 27 16:25:48 <lufimtse>	nice
Jul 27 16:25:53 <lufimtse>	I see,
Jul 27 16:25:57 <lufimtse>	the lock is in Platform class
Jul 27 16:26:05 <lufimtse>	ok, let's try the C road
Jul 27 16:26:20 <lufimtse>	thanks for suggestion
Jul 27 16:26:28 <lufimtse>	been stuck on that thought bubble for a while. 
Jul 27 16:26:34 <akurtakov>	I'm describing the simplest road in my head
Jul 27 16:26:43 <lufimtse>	:-D
Jul 27 16:26:45 <akurtakov>	quite possible I miss some important detail :)
Jul 27 16:26:51 <lufimtse>	who knows
Jul 27 16:26:55 <lufimtse>	but that seems promising
Jul 27 16:27:26 <lufimtse>	ok, I'll work on that. First I
Jul 27 16:27:36 <lufimtse>	I'll add webkit_custom.h etc... 
Jul 27 16:27:40 <lufimtse>	I'll keep you posted.
Jul 27 16:30:55 <akurtakov>	just as a reference I have booked g_task_run_in_thread_sync
Jul 27 16:32:00 <lufimtse>	what do you mean booked?
Jul 27 16:32:09 <akurtakov>	bookmarked :)
Jul 27 16:32:47 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 27 16:32:51 <lufimtse>	I'll tinker around with GTask
Jul 27 16:32:55 <lufimtse>	on native snippet
Jul 27 16:32:59 <lufimtse>	then port to SWT layer
Jul 27 16:33:07 <lufimtse>	SWT's custom C layer**
Jul 28 10:10:29 <lufimtse>	-----
Jul 28 10:10:32 <lufimtse>	hey ya
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@vpn1-5-5.ams2.redhat.com]
Jul 28 10:10:49 <akurtakov>	hey, whats up
Jul 28 10:10:50 <lufimtse>	I've started to check out the build jUnit logs you pointed me to
Jul 28 10:10:55 <lufimtse>	testBrowser3 keeps failing
Jul 28 10:11:02 <lufimtse>	does that occur much?
Jul 28 10:11:13 <lufimtse>	and it doesn't fail on my system
Jul 28 10:11:25 <akurtakov>	you look at linux or centos column
Jul 28 10:11:35 <lufimtse>	http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/N20160725-2000/testresults/html/org.eclipse.swt.tests_ep47N-unit-lin64_linux.gtk.x86_64_8.0.html#AllBrowserTests
Jul 28 10:11:59 <akurtakov>	that's ancient sles 11 running with xulrunner not with webbrowser
Jul 28 10:12:16 <akurtakov>	webmaster promised to update it to sles 12 with webkitgtk
Jul 28 10:12:20 <akurtakov>	ignore this one for now
Jul 28 10:12:55 <lufimtse>	ok.
Jul 28 10:13:18 <lufimtse>	I'm just patching up a few of the jUnits to get them to run a bit quicker.
Jul 28 10:13:25 <lufimtse>	~hope it doesn't cause breakage.
Jul 28 10:13:35 <lufimtse>	just some of the wait times are outrageous
Jul 28 10:13:37 <akurtakov>	careful :)
Jul 28 10:13:44 <lufimtse>	|-D
Jul 28 10:13:48 <lufimtse>	let's see what happens. 
Jul 28 10:13:54 <akurtakov>	seen that build.sh broke on hpux :)
Jul 28 10:14:05 <lufimtse>	just on hpux?
Jul 28 10:14:13 <akurtakov>	http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/commit/?id=bb87d69400922d842af2cdcb46b865a77d8495ff
Jul 28 10:14:23 <akurtakov>	well, there are failures on aix 
Jul 28 10:14:37 <akurtakov>	but I believe them to not be caused by build.sh change
Jul 28 10:21:42 <lufimtse>	hmm, I see
Jul 28 10:22:01 <lufimtse>	u think maybe it's this guy? gtk_adjustment_get_page_increment
Jul 28 10:24:47 <akurtakov>	yes
Jul 28 10:25:04 <lufimtse>	should I update the build.sh to not use any '=='
Jul 28 10:25:08 <lufimtse>	because there are some more further down.
Jul 28 10:25:14 <akurtakov>	hmm, where?
Jul 28 10:25:22 <lufimtse>	at bottom
Jul 28 10:25:28 <lufimtse>	also I could replace [[ ]] with [ ] 
Jul 28 10:25:39 <lufimtse>	as I think the [[ ]] may potentially need newer bash
Jul 28 10:25:51 <akurtakov>	yes please
Jul 28 10:25:56 <lufimtse>	although when replacing [[]] with [] I will need to change || to -o
Jul 28 10:25:59 <lufimtse>	kk
Jul 28 10:26:02 <lufimtse>	lemme work on that.
Jul 28 10:26:20 <akurtakov>	do you see now why this wasn't done
Jul 28 10:26:42 <akurtakov>	these things prevent us from delivering user visible changes (like the webkit2 port)
Jul 28 10:27:09 <lufimtse>	X-D
Jul 28 10:27:11 <lufimtse>	yah, 
Jul 28 10:27:16 <lufimtse>	but we have to push for innovation
Jul 28 10:27:28 *	lufimtse fixing up build.sh now
Jul 28 10:27:43 <akurtakov>	yes, we have to
Jul 28 10:28:09 <akurtakov>	but we have to keep our user base big and healthy as first goal
Jul 28 10:30:32 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 28 10:36:43 <lufimtse>	btw, on the side. shellED tends to hang and freeze my eclipse
Jul 28 10:36:48 <lufimtse>	does that happen much with you?
Jul 28 10:37:09 <akurtakov>	haven't used it much lately
Jul 28 10:37:17 <akurtakov>	most used tool for me is zimbra lately :(
Jul 28 10:41:22 <lufimtse>	he he
Jul 28 10:54:38 <lufimtse>	How about I script it so that colors are only printed for a bash shell?
Jul 28 10:54:48 <lufimtse>	~3 extra lines of code
Jul 28 10:54:59 <lufimtse>	or too specific?
Jul 28 10:55:33 <akurtakov>	too specific I think
Jul 28 10:55:37 <lufimtse>	kk
Jul 28 10:55:50 <akurtakov>	do you think it's possible this to break aix ?
Jul 28 10:56:34 <lufimtse>	not really, just looks funny in saved log
Jul 28 10:56:53 <lufimtse>	like prints odd characters
Jul 28 10:56:56 <lufimtse>	but it's not a big deal
Jul 28 10:57:00 <lufimtse>	just polish.
Jul 28 10:57:19 <lufimtse>	the fact that the echo did print into log indicates it works
Jul 28 10:57:29 <lufimtse>	btw
Jul 28 10:57:33 <lufimtse>	portability patch: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78072/
Jul 28 10:57:51 <lufimtse>	I removed advance syntax, to use only the conditional syntax already found in the script.
Jul 28 10:58:01 <lufimtse>	[ ] and use of '-o' instead of ||
Jul 28 10:58:12 <lufimtse>	this is POSIX standard I think
Jul 28 11:00:33 <lufimtse>	this should hopefully make it work on other build machines
Jul 28 11:00:35 <lufimtse>	lesson learned
Jul 28 11:18:18 <lufimtse>	I added you as reviewer. 
Jul 28 14:48:11 <akurtakov>	how are things going with webkit btw?
Jul 28 14:49:01 <lufimtse>	reading over GTask
Jul 28 14:49:06 <lufimtse>	atm
Jul 28 14:49:30 <akurtakov>	promising for now ?
Jul 28 14:50:01 <lufimtse>	you mean GTask or Webkit as a whole?
Jul 28 14:50:07 <akurtakov>	gtask
Jul 28 14:50:17 <akurtakov>	for webkit we simply have no alternative
Jul 28 14:50:32 <lufimtse>	I'm still kinda wrapping my head around it. Did a bit of testing of the font patch this morning
Jul 28 14:50:36 <lufimtse>	and build.sh etc... 
Jul 28 14:50:44 <lufimtse>	Eclipse looks nice again
Jul 28 14:50:50 <akurtakov>	hah cool
Jul 28 14:50:57 <akurtakov>	so next week is milestone week
Jul 28 14:51:01 <akurtakov>	keep this in mind
Jul 28 14:51:11 <akurtakov>	and tell the others in the office
Jul 28 14:51:38 <lufimtse>	What does that entail?
Jul 28 14:52:49 <akurtakov>	https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/Rhythm#Milestones
Jul 28 14:53:15 <akurtakov>	important part During that stabilization week, the code base is frozen from Tuesday onwards, except to fix regressions that are found during that week's testing.  
Jul 28 14:56:52 <lufimtse>	so code freeze for a week?
Jul 28 14:57:02 <akurtakov>	yes
Jul 28 14:57:05 <lufimtse>	meh
Jul 28 14:57:07 <lufimtse>	ok
Jul 28 14:57:22 <akurtakov>	well, it means you can't push
Jul 28 14:57:32 <akurtakov>	not that you should not work on fixing the webkit issues :)
Jul 28 14:57:39 <akurtakov>	just don't let them in during the week
Jul 28 14:59:38 <lufimtse>	kk
Jul 28 15:56:41 <lufimtse>	There is g_task_run_in_thread_sync() which may be what we awant
Jul 28 15:56:49 <lufimtse>	g_task_run_in_thread_sync
Jul 28 15:56:54 <lufimtse>	https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GTask.html#g-task-run-in-thread-sync
Jul 28 15:57:03 <lufimtse>	Runs task_func in another thread, and waits for it to return or be cancelled. You can use g_task_propagate_pointer(), etc, afterward to get the result of task_func .
Jul 28 15:57:07 <lufimtse>	I'll fiddle around with it.
Jul 28 15:57:19 <akurtakov>	sounds good
Jul 28 16:12:36 <akurtakov>	fyi https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=498829

Jul 29 14:09:46 <akurtakov>	hey
Jul 29 14:10:37 <lufimtse>	I read up through GTask, talked on IRC with GTK+ folks. They're saying that GTask is more for turning sync functions into async once. We're working to go the other way. GTK+ folks suggested regular spin lock
Jul 29 14:10:45 <lufimtse>	meh
Jul 29 14:10:57 <lufimtse>	GTask is somewhat complicated x_x
Jul 29 14:11:29 <akurtakov>	so be it :)
Jul 29 14:11:44 <akurtakov>	I hoped for easier way 
Jul 29 14:11:49 <lufimtse>	me too*
Jul 29 14:12:04 <lufimtse>	lemme prowl through glib's thread functins
Jul 29 15:10:47 <lufimtse>	do you know if we have a minimum gtk3 version? like gtk3.4 etc.. 
Jul 29 15:11:02 <lufimtse>	or go all the way to 3.0 
Jul 29 15:11:54 <akurtakov>	no
Jul 29 15:12:00 <akurtakov>	we have only one min requirement 
Jul 29 15:12:03 <akurtakov>	which is 2.18 now
Jul 29 15:12:16 <akurtakov>	everything above it is supported
Jul 29 15:12:34 <akurtakov>	the issue is I want to kill gtk2 first
Jul 29 15:12:50 <akurtakov>	but if let's say gtk 3.10
Jul 29 15:13:14 <akurtakov>	machines with 2.24 and 3.6 will fallback to 2.24 - defintely unwanted
Jul 29 15:15:50 <lufimtse>	GMutex uses glib 2.32, which needs Gtk3.4
Jul 29 15:16:09 <lufimtse>	I guess I can wrap things into version checks
Jul 29 15:16:13 <akurtakov>	yup
Jul 29 15:16:26 <lufimtse>	webkit2 would then require a min of gtk3.4, which is reasonable 
Jul 29 15:16:34 <akurtakov>	sounds fine to me
Jul 29 15:16:44 <akurtakov>	for this year I want to bump to 2.24
Jul 29 15:17:01 <lufimtse>	kk
Jul 29 15:17:06 <akurtakov>	next year 3.x
Jul 29 15:17:11 <akurtakov>	3.0 at least
Jul 29 15:17:14 <lufimtse>	X-D!!
Jul 29 15:17:24 <akurtakov>	but I would push for 3.10 :)
Jul 29 15:17:34 <lufimtse>	makes sense

Aug 17 14:32:41 <akurtakov>	you might need to use dlsym

Aug 31 13:50:32 <lufimtse>	hullo
Aug 31 13:50:36 <akurtakov>	hey
Aug 31 13:50:52 <lufimtse>	I'm in the process of testing the JS patch, in Eclipse, do you know where the browser is used besides mylyn?
Aug 31 13:51:01 <lufimtse>	I think it was used in some tooltip of sort?
Aug 31 13:51:02 <akurtakov>	internal web browser
Aug 31 13:51:21 <akurtakov>	that we you can open any site
Aug 31 14:12:03 <lufimtse>	Do you happen to know how to print a warning in eclipse?
Aug 31 14:12:06 <lufimtse>	in swt
Aug 31 14:12:23 <lufimtse>	I guess just regular system warning..
Aug 31 14:28:24 <akurtakov>	what do you want to do exactly?
Aug 31 14:52:01 <lufimtse>	Just warn user about using a half-baked function
Aug 31 14:52:04 <lufimtse>	I'll explain in a minute
Aug 31 14:52:06 <lufimtse>	OK
Aug 31 14:52:09 <lufimtse>	so patch is ready for review
Aug 31 14:52:10 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78567/
Aug 31 14:52:13 <lufimtse>	somewhat rough
Aug 31 14:52:31 <lufimtse>	but I want to tryna get it merged before starting to work on handling a return value.
Aug 31 14:52:49 <akurtakov>	that's not an issue
Aug 31 14:52:56 <akurtakov>	I mean no need to warn
Aug 31 14:53:03 <akurtakov>	as it's not smth enabled by default
Aug 31 14:53:23 <lufimtse>	Like at the bottom of this:
Aug 31 14:53:23 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78567/10/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse+SWT+WebKit/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/browser/WebKit.java
Aug 31 14:53:29 <akurtakov>	so we are fine even without any warnings for now
Aug 31 14:53:32 <lufimtse>	Should I just remove warnings?
Aug 31 14:53:40 <lufimtse>	okm
Aug 31 14:53:41 <akurtakov>	yes
Aug 31 14:53:41 <lufimtse>	ok
Aug 31 14:53:43 <lufimtse>	sec
Aug 31 14:54:26 <akurtakov>	I posted comments on the gerrit
Aug 31 14:55:28 <akurtakov>	I don't see why you need to link to gio
Aug 31 14:55:40 <akurtakov>	but I wrote that in the review too
Aug 31 14:56:22 <lufimtse>	I pushed a new patchset
Aug 31 14:56:47 <lufimtse>	link to gio is for GAsyncResult
Aug 31 14:56:55 <akurtakov>	ah I see
Aug 31 14:56:58 <akurtakov>	fine :)
Aug 31 14:57:05 <akurtakov>	reply to my comment
Aug 31 14:57:19 <lufimtse>	I could potentially tryna make it dynamically typed, but considering gio is in both gtk2 and gtk3 it may be worth keeping ^_^?
Aug 31 14:57:28 <akurtakov>	no need
Aug 31 14:57:41 <akurtakov>	I just wanted to verify it's not a leftover :)
Aug 31 14:57:46 <akurtakov>	but added on purpose :)
Aug 31 14:59:16 <lufimtse>	ah ok
Aug 31 14:59:35 <lufimtse>	so with this native stuff I'm half certain of what I'm doing.  More feedback = better ^__^
Aug 31 14:59:49 <lufimtse>	ditto for questions
Aug 31 15:00:02 <akurtakov>	np, looks good so far :)
Aug 31 15:00:14 <akurtakov>	there is always first time
Aug 31 15:00:27 <akurtakov>	I had no idea about these things when I started the gtk3 migration either :)
Aug 31 15:00:42 <lufimtse>	X-D
Aug 31 15:03:20 <akurtakov>	I have to run now
Aug 31 15:03:23 <akurtakov>	tty tomorro

Sep 08 16:03:58 <akurtakov>	quick outline in jdt

Sep 08 16:09:18 <lufimtse>	the screenshot shows black quick outline
Sep 08 16:09:47 <akurtakov>	ah this is probably it
Sep 08 16:10:01 <akurtakov>	I might have mixed it with some other thing jdt overrides :)
Sep 08 16:11:56 <lufimtse>	Just curious because my outline is still black atm
Sep 08 16:12:03 <lufimtse>	I haven't updated eclipse in a while
Sep 08 16:12:14 <lufimtse>	is it white for you?
Sep 08 16:12:16 <lufimtse>	or black still?
Sep 08 16:12:51 <lufimtse>	Personally, there are two things that bother me. 1) Broken DnD parts. 2) Black outline.
Sep 08 16:13:06 <lufimtse>	I wanna fix those, or at least work on one and get Ian onto the other
Sep 08 16:13:32 <lufimtse>	The DnD parts might take me a while, complex stuff.
Sep 08 16:13:44 <lufimtse>	but it's important to fix I think

Sep 08 16:14:40 <lufimtse>	Do you know if progress is being made on that bug, or does it require attention?
Sep 08 16:21:54 <akurtakov>	well isn't the black outline fixed for you

Sep 19 10:55:15 <lufimtse>	upgrade to gtk2.24 doesn't mean gio headers were installed.
Sep 19 10:55:22 <akurtakov>	it should
Sep 19 10:55:36 <akurtakov>	as it means glib 2.20+ is available

Oct 05 08:26:53 <akurtakov>	hey Leo
Oct 05 08:26:59 <akurtakov>	how is webkit stuff going
Oct 05 09:30:55 <lufimtse>	morning
Oct 05 09:31:03 <lufimtse>	worked on it yesterday
Oct 05 09:31:07 <lufimtse>	working my way through the test cases
Oct 05 09:31:19 <lufimtse>	some of them show that they work on webkit2, but they don't actually
Oct 05 09:31:23 <lufimtse>	like browser9
Oct 05 09:31:51 <lufimtse>	I merged some patches where I refactored some of the test cases
Oct 05 09:31:55 <lufimtse>	and made them a bit faster
Oct 05 09:32:33 <lufimtse>	Was gonna check if they build well, but yesterday's build failed
Oct 05 09:32:34 <lufimtse>	hmm
Oct 05 09:43:49 <akurtakov>	heh
Oct 05 09:44:06 <akurtakov>	you tested on your "test farm" right?
Oct 05 09:44:33 <lufimtse>	Well, I don't have a farm :-), but on my computer
Oct 05 09:45:09 <lufimtse>	I upgraded to F25 on monday
Oct 05 09:45:16 <lufimtse>	now some test cases hang with webkit2

Oct 19 16:04:22 <lufimtse>	Hmm. I'm not sure if by Dec I'd be able to get Webkit2 to the point where it can be used as the default. I need to make some architecture changes that will take a while or alternativley research a way to re-utilize the old code in some neat way, (which would also take a while). I have a vision of what needs to be done, just lack JNI knowledge to get it done quick enough. I'm thinking it might be a 
Oct 19 16:04:22 <lufimtse>	good time investment for me to spend a week reading the JNI book so that I understand the JNI framework and how to best use it. Then come back and piece together the remaining webkit functionality.

Oct 31 12:11:42 <akurtakov>	btw, how is webkit2 progressing ?
Oct 31 12:12:11 <lufimtse>	I'm still working my way through the jni book. Have some ideas on the polymorphism thing.
Oct 31 12:12:48 <lufimtse>	might re-utilize some existing functionality via custom callback from C back to java, and re-use some of the existing code. But still thinking about best way to implement this.
Oct 31 12:12:53 <lufimtse>	the jni book is very insightfull.
Oct 31 12:13:06 <lufimtse>	I'm starting to understand all that jni business.
Oct 31 12:13:26 <lufimtse>	Found a potential crasher in my stage 1 patch
Oct 31 12:13:34 <lufimtse>	because I didn't convert types properly.
Oct 31 12:13:53 <akurtakov>	would you please deliver a fix for it ?

Oct 31 12:14:32 <akurtakov>	Mikael and me just enabled swt tests in gerrit verification 
Oct 31 12:14:45 <lufimtse>	Interesting
Oct 31 12:14:51 <akurtakov>	and one out of 2-3 runs segfaults in webkit
Oct 31 12:15:03 <lufimtse>	Webkit1?
Oct 31 12:15:07 <akurtakov>	webkit3
Oct 31 12:15:19 <akurtakov>	libwebkitgtk3 :)
Oct 31 12:15:20 <lufimtse>	so Webkit 2 with Gtk3 bindings.
Oct 31 12:15:24 <akurtakov>	yes
Oct 31 12:15:27 <akurtakov>	no
Oct 31 12:15:36 <akurtakov>	webkit 1 api against gtk3
Oct 31 12:15:59 <lufimtse>	I'm sort of ignoring old webkit1 stuff, but I could look into it..
Oct 31 12:16:05 <lufimtse>	been focused on getting webkit2 working.
Oct 31 12:18:17 <lufimtse>	I know Browser6 is unstable on webkit1
Oct 31 12:18:47 <lufimtse>	crashes a lot.
Oct 31 12:19:10 <lufimtse>	It's not an interesting test case, just checks if title change listener kicks in I think...
Oct 31 12:20:15 <akurtakov>	well, crashes should never happen :0
Oct 31 12:21:55 <lufimtse>	I see.
Oct 31 12:22:13 <lufimtse>	Hmm, should I investigate crashes before I finish the webkit2 port or after?
Oct 31 12:22:20 <akurtakov>	after
Oct 31 12:22:22 <lufimtse>	ok.
Oct 31 12:22:27 <lufimtse>	btw: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/84252/
Oct 31 12:22:30 <akurtakov>	ideally if/when we can switch to gtk3
Oct 31 12:22:35 <akurtakov>	err webkit2
Oct 31 12:22:45 <lufimtse>	Was thinking the same...
Oct 31 12:22:46 <akurtakov>	there shouldn't be crashes to investigate :)
Oct 31 12:23:16 <lufimtse>	I could dissable some of the webkit jUnits until we have the webkit2 port complete?
Oct 31 12:23:21 <akurtakov>	no
Oct 31 12:23:23 <lufimtse>	ok.
Oct 31 12:23:32 <akurtakov>	that would mean disabling them in Nbuilds too
Oct 31 12:23:35 <akurtakov>	which we don't want
Oct 31 12:24:23 <lufimtse>	I'm guessing some of those segfaults occur due to improper type casting...
Oct 31 12:24:30 <lufimtse>	I mean conversion
Oct 31 12:24:53 <lufimtse>	When I'm fiddling with jni snippets, those cause crashes the most.
Oct 31 12:26:53 <lufimtse>	btw, this is the JNI project I've been experimenting with:https://github.com/LeoUfimtsev/jniSnippets/tree/master/jni
Oct 31 12:27:07 <lufimtse>	ex: https://github.com/LeoUfimtsev/jniSnippets/blob/master/jni/HelloJNI.c
Oct 31 12:27:46 <lufimtse>	Ideally I'd like to be able to use that to copy and paste bits of code for SWT development, and prototype java<->C interaction. 
Oct 31 12:45:25 <lufimtse>	------

Oct 31 12:45:45 <lufimtse>	is that because of the newly enabled stuff?
Oct 31 12:45:52 <akurtakov>	I disabled the tests recording

Nov 08 10:33:59 <lufimtse>	btw
Nov 08 10:34:19 <lufimtse>	In Converter.java, the methods have a paramater "codePage", that is never used...
Nov 08 15:23:00 <lufimtse>	hmm
Nov 08 15:23:05 <lufimtse>	was today code freeze of sort?
Nov 09 01:13:36 <akurtakov>	no
Nov 09 01:13:38 <akurtakov>	why
Nov 09 01:14:08 <akurtakov>	every tuesday there is I-build
Nov 09 01:14:23 <akurtakov>	so in theory best time to merge stuff is right after it
Nov 09 09:23:08 <lufimtse>	I think that code freeze was for maintenance

Nov 29 11:48:34 <lufimtse>	no
Nov 29 11:48:37 <akurtakov>	it's M4 next week so if it doesn't I would rather move it to M5
Nov 29 11:48:43 <akurtakov>	ok, moving to M5
Nov 29 11:48:44 <lufimtse>	ok
Nov 29 11:51:15 <akurtakov>	so how are things for you ?
Nov 29 11:51:28 <lufimtse>	Good good. At the moment investigating browser function
Nov 29 11:51:36 <akurtakov>	any progress there?
Nov 29 11:51:39 <lufimtse>	Somewhat
Nov 29 11:51:55 <lufimtse>	I understand how SWT implemented it
Nov 29 11:52:00 <lufimtse>	now tinkering with native snippets
Nov 29 11:52:07 <akurtakov>	good
Nov 29 12:08:10 <akurtakov>	which is the patch you just hit ?
Nov 29 12:08:41 <lufimtse>	hmm?
Nov 29 12:08:54 <lufimtse>	I just wipped together this one very quickly:
Nov 29 12:08:54 <lufimtse>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=507062
Nov 29 12:09:06 <lufimtse>	~1 hour 
Nov 29 12:09:10 <lufimtse>	just to close the thing off.
Nov 29 12:09:18 <akurtakov>	I just read your mail to swt -dev :)
Nov 29 12:09:24 <lufimtse>	X-D
Nov 29 12:09:50 <lufimtse>	I found that mylyn is nice, but sometimes my eclipse dies 
Nov 29 12:10:00 <lufimtse>	was hoping to keep systems a little bit separate
Nov 29 12:10:00 <akurtakov>	you're working on this :)
Nov 29 12:10:07 <akurtakov>	it's webkit crashes :)
Nov 29 12:10:11 <lufimtse>	X-D
Nov 29 12:10:12 <lufimtse>	yah
Nov 29 12:10:31 <lufimtse>	I also found I like to have Eclipse on one monitor, and browser with bugs on the other.
Nov 29 12:10:55 <lufimtse>	I like to bookmark bugs with firefox tags
Nov 29 12:10:59 <lufimtse>	makes it easier to find them later
Nov 29 12:13:18 <akurtakov>	please don't set M4 during this week
Nov 29 12:13:31 <akurtakov>	we are supposed to be reducing bugs targetting M4 now not adding more :)
Nov 29 12:14:04 <lufimtse>	Did I set Target milestone to some bugs?
Nov 29 12:14:14 <lufimtse>	I may have without giving it thought
Nov 29 12:14:23 <lufimtse>	like left it as default sort of thing....

Nov 29 12:14:50 <akurtakov>	it's for jdt.text but your new patch is against platform.text which confused me
Nov 29 12:15:05 <lufimtse>	I see. afik Vogella set it to M4

Dec 12 12:44:43 <akurtakov>	there are some but guarded to not exec on non x11

Dec 12 13:12:23 <lufimtse>	hmm
Dec 12 13:12:32 <lufimtse>	actually neva mind.
Dec 12 13:12:53 <akurtakov>	? 
Dec 12 13:13:03 <lufimtse>	Just a thought on Gtk3.14
Dec 12 13:14:02 <lufimtse>	If Ian does the work of cleaning up DnD logic now, then when Gtk3.14 comes out, then it'll be only removing 4-10 lines of code. If we delay it, then I'll have to spend time re-figuring out the DnD stuff and remove lots later... But I guess that's not a major deal.
Dec 12 13:14:30 <lufimtse>	But you made a valid point about potentially breaking 3.0- 3.14 logic.
Dec 12 13:14:38 <lufimtse>	That could bite us also..
Dec 12 13:14:50 <lufimtse>	Meh
Dec 12 13:15:05 <akurtakov>	yes, and we will have no excuse to say - just update - as we would have just broken it
Dec 12 13:15:43 <lufimtse>	on the other hand it could help us find DnD bugs in the new logic sooner.
Dec 12 13:16:00 <lufimtse>	Rather than wait till everyone reaches 3.14 and reports it later.
Dec 12 13:16:26 <lufimtse>	But meh.
Dec 12 13:17:15 <lufimtse>	Oh well.

Dec 13 15:28:33 <akurtakov>	how is webkit stuff going ?
Dec 13 15:31:38 <lufimtse>	Good good. Evaluate() works with arrays. I need to write jUnits and finalize testing. Browser.Function() works in principle on a C snippet. Working on porting that to SWT layer.
Dec 13 15:31:43 <lufimtse>	I've got side tracked by: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=508245
Dec 13 15:31:58 <lufimtse>	Markus indeed revealed a mistake that I did.
Dec 13 15:32:17 <lufimtse>	I set up a Win 10 box and a MacBook to pin this bug.

Dec 20 11:17:03 <akurtakov>	what's the status for browserfunctions
Dec 20 11:17:15 <lufimtse>	Just before we get into that
Dec 20 11:17:22 <lufimtse>	About the webkit1 crashes
Dec 20 11:17:39 <lufimtse>	Feel free to read last comment here: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=509411
Dec 20 11:17:54 <lufimtse>	The context iteration there seems to cause webkit1 to crash.
Dec 20 11:18:14 <lufimtse>	Now my question
Dec 20 11:18:33 <lufimtse>	I could investigate the context iteration in Shell.setVisible(), but this would take me a while.
Dec 20 11:18:41 <lufimtse>	Or continue with Webkit2 browser.function() port.
Dec 20 11:19:47 <akurtakov>	what is the estimates ?
Dec 20 11:21:14 <lufimtse>	Shell.SetVisible probaly a week (or two). I need to figure out the RCP business, reproduce problem what the fix resolved and find another solution to it. 
Dec 20 11:21:22 <lufimtse>	Alternative:  
Dec 20 11:21:32 <lufimtse>	I could dissable some of the newly added tests on webkit1 for now.
Dec 20 11:21:41 <lufimtse>	till I get webkit2 working properly.
Dec 20 11:21:49 <lufimtse>	then come back to webkit1 if time permits.
Dec 20 11:23:34 <lufimtse>	Just a theory: The crash occurs deeply in webkit1. It might be a fault in webkit1 itself. Any context iteration call while webkit1 is running can be harmfull by the looks.a
Dec 20 11:23:46 <lufimtse>	But I may be wrong.
Dec 20 11:23:49 <akurtakov>	what about browser.function
Dec 20 11:24:09 <lufimtse>	Probably 2-3 weeks(?)
Dec 20 11:24:22 <lufimtse>	Plus fix bits and pieces
Dec 20 11:26:19 <lufimtse>	If I put everything aside, I think I should be able to get browser function working by end of January.
Dec 20 11:26:29 <lufimtse>	or sooner if things go well
Dec 20 11:26:48 <lufimtse>	or later if s*** hits the fan X-D
Dec 20 11:27:10 <lufimtse>	But for browser.function I got a native snippet working. Proof of concept.
Dec 20 11:27:15 <lufimtse>	I just need to port it to SWT.
Dec 20 11:47:27 <lufimtse>	meh
Dec 20 11:47:35 <lufimtse>	So
Dec 20 11:47:42 <akurtakov>	go with the browser function
Dec 20 11:47:49 <lufimtse>	Ok.
Dec 20 11:48:01 <akurtakov>	and disable the test (if it's easy)
Dec 20 11:48:05 <akurtakov>	for webkit1
Dec 20 11:48:13 <akurtakov>	btw will browser functions
Dec 20 11:48:14 <lufimtse>	ok.
Dec 20 11:48:23 <lufimtse>	will browser functions?
Dec 20 11:48:33 <akurtakov>	be implemented in stages like evaluate
Dec 20 11:48:42 <lufimtse>	No.
Dec 20 11:48:46 <lufimtse>	I expect a single patch.
Dec 20 11:48:52 <lufimtse>	I figured out how to do the arrays for evaluate.
Dec 20 11:48:58 <lufimtse>	I will replicate logic for function.
Dec 20 11:49:02 <akurtakov>	ok
Dec 20 11:51:38 <akurtakov>	so this javascript:executeCommand() will be be browser function
Dec 20 11:51:46 <lufimtse>	No
Dec 20 11:51:48 <lufimtse>	well
Dec 20 11:52:00 <lufimtse>	2 parts
Dec 20 11:52:09 <lufimtse>	part 1) Use exec() to register function
Dec 20 11:52:18 <lufimtse>	part 2) use new webkit2 api for return call to java
Dec 20 11:52:26 <lufimtse>	sec
Dec 20 11:52:47 <akurtakov>	so executeCommand is exec and it already works
Dec 20 11:53:04 <akurtakov>	what are the cases where I need 2)
Dec 20 11:54:06 <lufimtse>	Well, suppose you want javascript to call java. This doesn't work with exec. Ex you register a custom 'mouse-over' listener in java script, and you want that to call java.
Dec 20 11:54:29 <lufimtse>	Sec
Dec 20 11:55:09 <lufimtse>	Ex snippet 307
Dec 20 11:55:51 <lufimtse>	An html button wants to trigger a callback that is handled in Java.
Dec 20 11:56:05 <lufimtse>	This doesn't work on webkit2 without browser.function().
Dec 20 11:56:44 <lufimtse>	Example real life use case is some UML or graphic reports are drawn in html. Ex in Mylyn's/Tasktop's reporting.
Dec 20 11:58:07 <lufimtse>	Ok. I'll dissable some of those tests on webkit1 for now and will move onto browser.function().
Dec 20 12:14:57 <akurtakov>	hmm
Dec 20 12:15:09 <akurtakov>	do you have a snippet to test
Dec 20 12:15:16 <lufimtse>	browser.function?
Dec 20 12:15:53 <akurtakov>	yeah
Dec 20 12:17:08 <akurtakov>	e.g. Snippet362?
Dec 20 12:17:51 <akurtakov>	but it does nothing with webkit1 too :)
Dec 20 12:20:33 <lufimtse>	Snippet 307 <<
Dec 20 12:20:42 <akurtakov>	ok
Dec 20 12:21:08 <akurtakov>	so browser functions is java function registered as js callable one 
Dec 20 12:21:16 <lufimtse>	I'll investigate Snippet362 also... 
Dec 20 12:21:18 <akurtakov>	is this the correct way to describe it :)
Dec 20 12:21:26 <lufimtse>	yea
Dec 20 12:21:49 <lufimtse>	Webkit2 has an api for JS to callback C/Java.
Dec 20 12:22:14 <lufimtse>	I shall be using it.
Dec 20 12:29:39 <lufimtse>	Hey
Dec 20 12:29:43 <lufimtse>	About this guy
Dec 20 12:29:44 <lufimtse>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=507550
Dec 20 12:29:46 <lufimtse>	Same business
Dec 20 12:30:04 <lufimtse>	that is ...
Dec 20 12:30:43 <lufimtse>	Webkit crashes if OS.gtk_main_iteration_do(.) is called while webkit does something, webkit1 crashes.
Dec 20 12:31:07 <lufimtse>	^ Please excuse above grammar. It is bad. I started typing, then went to check something, then continued typing.
Dec 20 12:31:16 <akurtakov>	np
Dec 20 12:31:29 <lufimtse>	Basically there is a pattern here.
Dec 20 12:31:56 <lufimtse>	Theory: I think most webkit crashes are caused by OS.gtk_main_iteration_do invocations.
Dec 20 12:32:10 <lufimtse>	Good news is that webkit2 is not affected.
Dec 20 12:32:20 <akurtakov>	perfect
Dec 20 12:34:24 <akurtakov>	I'm curious what should Snippet362 do
Dec 20 12:34:32 <lufimtse>	lemme checks
Dec 20 12:34:33 <akurtakov>	this snipped doesn't make sense tome
Dec 20 12:36:28 <lufimtse>	Looks like idea is that when you click somewhere, mouseDownHappened(..) should be called.
Dec 20 12:36:39 <lufimtse>	mouseDownHappened(..) is handled in java and prints something in java console.
Dec 20 12:36:47 <lufimtse>	At the moment this doesn't seem to be working thou.
Dec 20 12:36:50 <lufimtse>	Not sure why.
Dec 20 12:37:10 <lufimtse>	final BrowserFunction function = new CustomFunction (browser, "mouseDownHappened");   <<< registers the function
Dec 20 12:37:19 <akurtakov>	my gut feelings tells me that event is not propagated to swt at all 
Dec 20 12:37:25 <akurtakov>	aka webkit eats it :)
Dec 20 12:37:45 <lufimtse>	Theory 1: javascript is not triggoring window.onmouseDown
Dec 20 12:37:59 <lufimtse>	Theory 2: it is it is triggering, but doesn't reach javaland for some reason.
Dec 20 12:38:34 <akurtakov>	Theory 3: it's triggered but webkitwebview handles it and doesn't propagate the event :)
Dec 20 12:38:55 <lufimtse>	I think Theory 1: is the case
Dec 20 12:39:08 <lufimtse>	if you set browser.setUrl("www.google.com") then it works.
Dec 20 12:39:20 <lufimtse>	So it seems eclipse.org eats the onmouseDown event for breakfast.
Dec 20 12:39:40 <lufimtse>	and doesn't allow it to propogate to the registered mouseDownHappened.
Dec 20 12:39:57 <akurtakov>	WHAT??
Dec 20 12:40:26 <lufimtse>	he he.
Dec 20 12:41:24 <lufimtse>	So there are 2 ways to fix the snippet.
Dec 20 12:41:34 <lufimtse>	fix 1: s/eclipse.org/www.google.com
Dec 20 12:42:03 <akurtakov>	hmm, can't we make auction for the url to set :)
Dec 20 12:42:08 <lufimtse>	fix 2: Move "final BrowserFunction function = new CustomFunction (browser, "mouseDownHappened");" into   ProgressAdapter.completed(..)
Dec 20 12:42:34 <lufimtse>	There are many ways to fix.
Dec 20 12:42:42 <lufimtse>	basically eclipse.org overrides onmousedown(..)
Dec 20 12:42:44 <lufimtse>	so snippet broke.
Dec 20 12:42:51 <lufimtse>	:'-(
Dec 20 12:43:09 <lufimtse>	I can submit patch to fix this
Dec 20 12:43:16 <akurtakov>	please do 
Dec 20 12:43:22 <akurtakov>	we should sell urls :)
Dec 20 12:43:29 <lufimtse>	what u mean?
Dec 20 12:43:50 <akurtakov>	whoever pays most get's his url set in the snippets :)
Dec 20 12:43:56 <lufimtse>	he he he.
Dec 20 12:55:54 <lufimtse>	Hmmm
Dec 20 12:56:12 <lufimtse>	I found a perculiar crasher.
Dec 20 12:56:17 <akurtakov>	?
Dec 20 12:56:21 <lufimtse>	With the snippet fixed up,
Dec 20 12:56:37 <lufimtse>	when I click, I see messages in console
Dec 20 12:56:40 <lufimtse>	Now
Dec 20 12:56:52 <lufimtse>	if I click once, I see one message. When I close snippet, all is well.
Dec 20 12:57:05 <lufimtse>	if I click twice or more, I see messages. When I close snippet, webkit dies.
Dec 20 12:58:29 <lufimtse>	Meh. At the time of crash, java isn't running.
Dec 20 12:58:38 <lufimtse>	seems some dispose logic bug.
Dec 20 12:58:46 <lufimtse>	I'll keep an eye on it for webkit2 port.

Jan 03 13:53:00 <akurtakov>	hey Leo
Jan 03 13:53:03 <akurtakov>	happy new year 
Jan 03 14:36:09 <lufimtse>	hello
Jan 03 14:36:12 <lufimtse>	you too ^__^
Jan 03 14:36:24 <lufimtse>	I'm investigating this guy: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=509696
Jan 03 14:37:14 <akurtakov>	I believe I fixed it via http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/commit/?id=25eb914f0d3f8e07ddf431b8972af7a93d29a808
Jan 03 14:37:44 <akurtakov>	but you would have to wait for todays nightly build
Jan 03 14:38:00 <akurtakov>	as tests run against swt from repo not from maven reactor
Jan 03 14:38:24 <lufimtse>	well
Jan 03 14:38:25 <lufimtse>	https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.swt-Gerrit/3768/console
Jan 03 14:38:30 <lufimtse>	Tests in error: 
Jan 03 14:38:30 <lufimtse>	  Test_org_eclipse_swt_graphics_Cursor.test_ConstructorLorg_eclipse_swt_graphics_DeviceI:107 » SWT
Jan 03 14:38:48 <lufimtse>	meaning hudson still failed with that patch
Jan 03 14:38:51 <lufimtse>	?
Jan 03 14:38:56 <akurtakov>	that's because tests run against latest swt in I-builds repo
Jan 03 14:39:05 <akurtakov>	not against the just compiled jar
Jan 03 14:39:22 <akurtakov>	a limitation in our tycho infra
Jan 03 14:39:25 <lufimtse>	meh?
Jan 03 14:39:34 <akurtakov>	too long story for me to explain now :)
Jan 03 14:39:40 <lufimtse>	that's from: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/87943/
Jan 03 14:39:46 <lufimtse>	i.e, the patch that you submitted
Jan 03 14:39:58 <akurtakov>	yes
Jan 03 14:40:00 <akurtakov>	I know
Jan 03 14:40:04 <lufimtse>	from what I gather, that hudson build uses the patch?
Jan 03 14:40:08 <lufimtse>	no?
Jan 03 14:40:16 <akurtakov>	uses the patch to build swt
Jan 03 14:40:33 <akurtakov>	but when running the tests it runs them against the swt jar from Ibuilds repo
Jan 03 14:41:08 <akurtakov>	just wait for tonights I-builds and we will see whether I fixed it
Jan 03 14:43:42 <lufimtse>	So hudson test uses SWT.jar that is compiled in I-Builds, but it uses jUnit tests that are defined in the SWT in the patch?
Jan 03 14:43:55 <akurtakov>	yes
Jan 03 14:44:35 <akurtakov>	its more complicated
Jan 03 14:44:44 <lufimtse>	hmm
Jan 03 14:44:50 <akurtakov>	things are bounded by bundle level
Jan 03 14:45:08 <akurtakov>	a change inside a bundle is affecting what happens inside the bundle
Jan 03 14:45:23 <akurtakov>	but if the bundle requires other bundles
Jan 03 14:45:37 <akurtakov>	changes in the same patch to the other bundles will not affect it
Jan 03 14:46:00 <akurtakov>	because the bundle compile/run classpath is formed by the content of the ibuilds repo
Jan 03 14:46:12 <lufimtse>	hmm. In the context of SWT. If I submit an SWT patch (e.g in Control.java), would it be tested right away or would I have to re-run hudson the next day to verify?
Jan 03 14:47:01 <lufimtse>	(because from what I gather changes in swt.tests are tested right away)
Jan 03 14:47:16 <akurtakov>	yes changes in tests are tested right away
Jan 03 14:47:34 <lufimtse>	How about changes in things like Control.java?
Jan 03 14:47:49 <akurtakov>	not tested directly
Jan 03 14:47:58 <akurtakov>	I mean immediately
Jan 03 14:48:06 <lufimtse>	So I'd have to wait till next iBuild?
Jan 03 14:48:09 <akurtakov>	yes
Jan 03 14:48:12 <lufimtse>	I see.
Jan 03 14:48:17 <akurtakov>	or best run full build locally
Jan 03 14:48:25 <lufimtse>	hmm
Jan 03 14:48:39 <akurtakov>	I mean building from inside org.eclipse.releng.aggregator
Jan 03 14:48:58 <lufimtse>	That's counter intuitive (having to wait for a day..).. Do we have any way to fix this?
Jan 03 14:48:59 <akurtakov>	as what I described is side effect of -Pbuild-individual-bundles
Jan 03 14:49:15 <lufimtse>	Is there some open bug for that?
Jan 03 14:49:28 <akurtakov>	there was one from markus keller
Jan 03 14:49:35 <akurtakov>	but it's middle ground
Jan 03 14:49:44 <lufimtse>	what do you mean by middle ground?
Jan 03 14:49:55 <akurtakov>	as you either want to build everything or treat bundles individually
Jan 03 14:50:03 <akurtakov>	otherwise it's unclear where you put the border
Jan 03 14:50:20 <akurtakov>	and swt makes it worse cause you can't rely on things being in the same repo even
Jan 03 14:50:33 <akurtakov>	as org.eclipse.swt is hollow jar
Jan 03 14:51:00 <lufimtse>	Could we do some hacking for swt?
Jan 03 14:51:01 <akurtakov>	and all the classes are actually in o.e.swt.gtk.linux.x8_64 jar which is produced in another repo build
Jan 03 14:51:04 <lufimtse>	as swt is somewhat special?
Jan 03 14:51:31 <lufimtse>	like for swt maven, first build binaries, then run maven?
Jan 03 14:51:37 <lufimtse>	and use newly build swt... 
Jan 03 14:53:11 <akurtakov>	that would be quite an adventure
Jan 03 14:53:52 <akurtakov>	and will run for hours and will practically kill hudson
Jan 03 14:54:09 <akurtakov>	not hours but will make 1h+ for a gerrit build
Jan 03 14:54:57 <akurtakov>	as all combos will have to build including the 64to32 jump and so on
Jan 03 15:00:20 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Jan 03 15:00:33 <lufimtse>	but hudson is only 1 machine, why build all combos
Jan 03 15:00:51 <lufimtse>	not just the one 64 bit thing for that particular machine..
Jan 03 15:00:52 <akurtakov>	because that's how the swt.binaries repo is setup
Jan 03 15:01:14 <lufimtse>	I mean like
Jan 03 15:01:18 <akurtakov>	I'm not saying it can't be done
Jan 03 15:01:34 <akurtakov>	I'm saying to do it will require significant change in how everything is setup
Jan 03 15:02:08 <lufimtse>	Hmmm.
Jan 03 15:02:18 <akurtakov>	which will require someone with quite a lot of time, tycho maven ant and etc knowledge
Jan 03 15:02:52 <lufimtse>	Hmm. Maybe I could start off with setting up something hudson-like
Jan 03 15:03:02 <lufimtse>	do you know what OS hudson uses?
Jan 03 15:03:10 <akurtakov>	not until you're done with webkit
Jan 03 15:03:16 <lufimtse>	I see
Jan 03 15:03:19 <akurtakov>	mind you this has to be done by end of month
Jan 03 15:03:42 <lufimtse>	I see. Ok, I'll put that on the back for now.
Jan 03 15:03:43 <akurtakov>	we (our team) has to report actual features we deliver for every release
Jan 03 15:04:01 <akurtakov>	and for the Feb release we deliver wayland
Jan 03 15:04:14 <lufimtse>	X-D
Jan 03 15:04:15 <lufimtse>	I see
Jan 03 15:04:20 <akurtakov>	plus webkit2 
Jan 03 15:04:39 <akurtakov>	so it's swt under the light
Jan 03 15:04:50 <akurtakov>	we can't afford spending time on other operations
Jan 03 15:05:04 <akurtakov>	if/when you're interested in starting this task
Jan 03 15:05:16 <akurtakov>	try to make swt.binaries repo build faster first
Jan 03 15:05:35 <lufimtse>	Ok. Later. 
Jan 03 15:05:37 <akurtakov>	simplifying/speeding the ant/maven/sh combo used and etc.
Jan 03 15:05:53 <akurtakov>	I insist on that because before trying to setup alternative
Jan 03 15:06:03 <akurtakov>	one should know how things work now very well
Jan 03 15:06:09 <lufimtse>	I didn't know about the hudson business above. Kinda killed a fair bit of time investigating a failing test :-|. Oh well.
Jan 03 15:07:32 <akurtakov>	it's good to try keeping tests infra and etc. in good shape
Jan 03 15:08:19 <akurtakov>	but knowing how things work first will save a lot of time :)
Jan 03 15:16:36 <lufimtse>	:-D yah. Seems I learn about stuff as I bump into things.
Jan 03 15:17:03 <lufimtse>	And just when I thought I knew all the quircks of swt...
Jan 03 15:17:16 <akurtakov>	no one knows them all
Jan 03 15:17:20 <lufimtse>	he he.
Jan 03 15:17:40 <lufimtse>	btw, do you know what os hudson runs on?
Jan 03 15:17:45 <lufimtse>	just curious for future reference
Jan 03 15:17:55 <lufimtse>	that runs the tests
Jan 03 15:18:09 <akurtakov>	sles 12 and centos7 
Jan 03 15:18:16 <akurtakov>	depending on which slave you run
Jan 03 15:20:07 <lufimtse>	Ok, so the notion of slave is new to me? But ok, I probably don't need to know this now. I'll revise this later after webkit2/wayland.
Jan 03 15:20:31 *	lufimtse investigating browser function.
Jan 03 15:24:00 <lufimtse>	btw
Jan 03 15:24:07 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/87565/
Jan 03 15:24:29 <akurtakov>	will look into it tomorrow, it's a bit late for me
Jan 03 15:24:35 <lufimtse>	ok.
Jan 03 15:24:43 <akurtakov>	but I dislike the amount of disabled tests :)
Jan 03 15:25:18 <akurtakov>	esp as webkit1 stays default :)
Jan 03 15:25:28 <akurtakov>	and I don't see all these tests failing on my machine
Jan 03 15:25:52 <akurtakov>	it would mean that I'll no longer see potential new breakage on my machine when runnint tests with webkit1
Jan 03 15:25:55 <akurtakov>	anyway
Jan 03 15:25:59 <akurtakov>	too late so g'night :)
Jan 03 15:26:09 <lufimtse>	ok. I'll email details.
Jan 03 15:26:15 <lufimtse>	night night :-)
Jan 04 10:46:30 <lufimtse>	huulloo
Jan 04 10:46:38 <akurtakov>	hey
Jan 04 10:46:40 <akurtakov>	what's up
Jan 04 10:46:45 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/87565/
Jan 04 10:47:14 <akurtakov>	seen my reply by email?
Jan 04 10:47:15 <lufimtse>	meh
Jan 04 10:47:18 <lufimtse>	yah
Jan 04 10:48:13 <akurtakov>	about browser function
Jan 04 10:48:30 <akurtakov>	which webkitgtk function you use
Jan 04 10:48:44 <lufimtse>	https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitUserContentManager.html#WebKitUserContentManager-script-message-received
Jan 04 10:49:09 <lufimtse>	I register the handler, then javascript can make a callback
Jan 04 10:49:26 <akurtakov>	can't you embed result in WebKitJavascriptResult ?
Jan 04 10:49:41 <akurtakov>	or I misunderstood totally
Jan 04 10:51:26 <lufimtse>	Well, that structure holds the data that javascript passes to Gtk
Jan 04 10:51:39 <lufimtse>	it's freed at the end of the callback
Jan 04 10:51:59 <akurtakov>	ah
Jan 04 10:52:36 <lufimtse>	I'll experiment with calling exec() inside the callback, 
Jan 04 10:52:40 <lufimtse>	maybe that'll work.
Jan 04 10:52:53 <lufimtse>	but about the webkit1 tests
Jan 04 10:52:54 <akurtakov>	you said you had the C prototype ready
Jan 04 10:52:58 <lufimtse>	yea
Jan 04 10:53:23 <lufimtse>	https://github.com/LeoUfimtsev/LeoGtk3/blob/master/webkit_callback.c
Jan 04 10:53:34 <lufimtse>	Here javascript calls Gtk
Jan 04 10:53:40 <lufimtse>	passes an array of values to it.
Jan 04 10:53:59 <lufimtse>	I didn't consider the case that the callback would return a value back to javascript until yesterday
Jan 04 10:55:59 <lufimtse>	------------- 
Jan 04 10:55:59 <lufimtse>	about the webkit1 crash tests.
Jan 04 10:56:14 <lufimtse>	Note: we have a bug to track webkit1 crashes: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=509587
Jan 04 10:56:29 <lufimtse>	there are 3 situations where crashes occur, each bug has steps to reproduce
Jan 04 10:56:35 <akurtakov>	yeah, I know
Jan 04 10:57:02 <akurtakov>	that's why I say disable only the new test(s) that is known to fail always 
Jan 04 10:57:10 <akurtakov>	and let the rest be dealed separately
Jan 04 10:57:23 <akurtakov>	once disabled tests rarely (never) get enabled :)
Jan 04 10:58:20 <lufimtse>	 #plausible. 
Jan 04 10:59:36 <lufimtse>	 by dealed separatley, do you mean I should submit a separate patch to dissable them or let things be for now.
Jan 04 10:59:48 <akurtakov>	let things be 
Jan 04 11:00:00 <akurtakov>	these crashes are things users see
Jan 04 11:00:21 <akurtakov>	so disabling tests is not an improvement
Jan 04 11:00:42 <akurtakov>	thus - lets not introduce new known to always fail tests
Jan 04 11:00:49 <akurtakov>	and concentrate on webkit2
Jan 04 11:01:54 <lufimtse>	 Ok, fair enough. Expect random hudson failures ^_^.
Jan 04 11:02:01 <lufimtse>	I'll update patch.
Jan 04 11:02:01 <akurtakov>	yeah, I know
Jan 04 11:02:12 <akurtakov>	it's always a compromise
Jan 04 11:02:22 <akurtakov>	I hate it but we can't fix the world
Jan 04 11:02:36 <akurtakov>	it was that case in the past too
Jan 04 11:03:03 <akurtakov>	just we were not seeing failures as tests were not run (1 month ago ) by hudson at all 
Jan 04 11:03:24 <lufimtse>	I see.
Jan 04 11:03:41 <akurtakov>	so it's step by step
Jan 04 11:04:06 <akurtakov>	we have enabled tests so its fine to have some stabilization period now :)
Jan 04 11:04:11 <lufimtse>	on the side, webkitgtk+ folks suggested to use jsExec inside the callback to simulate return value. So I'll continue down that path for browser.function.
Jan 04 11:04:20 <akurtakov>	good
Jan 04 11:04:52 <akurtakov>	there are cases where browser function doesn't need to return value, right?
Jan 04 11:05:15 <akurtakov>	if you have that part ready can we get it in while you work on the return 
Jan 04 11:05:27 <lufimtse>	Yea. I think returning a value from the callback is probably rather rare.
Jan 04 11:05:35 <lufimtse>	I was having a simmilar thought...
Jan 04 11:05:56 <lufimtse>	Ok. I"ll break it appart into stages.
Jan 04 11:06:01 <akurtakov>	perfect
Jan 04 11:06:18 <akurtakov>	once we get that part I'll start the noise to making it default when webkit2 found
Jan 04 11:06:39 <akurtakov>	and we keep the return as a must have though
Jan 04 11:06:57 <akurtakov>	just exposing early to Milestone/I builds users
Jan 04 11:07:18 <lufimtse>	My plan: 1) Implement browser.function()    2) fix broken jUnits on Webkit2     3)Make sure eclipse actually works well with webkit2.     4) make webkit2 default.
Jan 04 11:07:20 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Jan 04 11:07:30 <lufimtse>	about 1), I can postpone return value till later.
Jan 04 11:07:47 <lufimtse>	currently browser.function() doesn't have any jUnits, but I wrote some.
Jan 04 11:07:55 <akurtakov>	1) implement browser.function w/o return
Jan 04 11:08:12 <akurtakov>	2a) start gathering support for making webkit2 default
Jan 04 11:08:27 <akurtakov>	2b) work on browser.function with return
Jan 04 11:08:46 <akurtakov>	3a) make webkit2 defualt
Jan 04 11:09:02 <akurtakov>	3b)  make sure eclipse runs well with webkit 2
Jan 04 11:09:10 <lufimtse>	X-D
Jan 04 11:09:13 <akurtakov>	4) junit impromvements
Jan 04 11:09:21 <akurtakov>	each a and b happen in parallel
Jan 04 11:09:41 <lufimtse>	*parallel* -> interesting 
Jan 04 11:09:44 <lufimtse>	I see
Jan 04 11:09:45 <lufimtse>	ok.
Jan 04 11:10:06 <akurtakov>	it pretty much I push a) you push b) :)
Jan 04 11:10:24 <lufimtse>	sounds good.

Jan 05 10:33:25 <akurtakov>	hi Leo
Jan 05 10:33:38 <akurtakov>	do you know the difference between -1 and -2 in gerrit ?
Jan 05 11:00:40 <lufimtse>	hello
Jan 05 11:00:50 <lufimtse>	-1 is preffere not to merge
Jan 05 11:00:55 <lufimtse>	-2 is *do not merge*
Jan 05 11:01:47 <lufimtse>	Not sure if new behaviour, but it kinda seems that with hudson doing -1, submit button doesn't seem to be available anymore
Jan 05 11:01:47 <lufimtse>	meh
Jan 05 11:02:08 <lufimtse>	one way around that is to start a build and do a merge :-)
Jan 05 11:02:16 <lufimtse>	while build is being done.
Jan 05 11:03:20 <akurtakov>	that's normal
Jan 05 11:03:25 <akurtakov>	-1 is do not merge
Jan 05 11:03:42 <akurtakov>	-2 is approach is fundamentally wrong 
Jan 05 11:03:57 <akurtakov>	the issue with -2 is that once someone sets -2
Jan 05 11:04:04 <akurtakov>	only he can unset it
Jan 05 11:04:12 <akurtakov>	and noone else can review/push a patch
Jan 05 11:04:18 <akurtakov>	keep this in mind for the future
Jan 05 11:04:30 <akurtakov>	also -1 is cleaned on new patch 
Jan 05 11:04:40 <akurtakov>	so patch shows as ready for review
Jan 05 11:04:49 <akurtakov>	but if there is -2 this doesn't happen
Jan 05 11:05:13 <lufimtse>	I see
Jan 05 11:05:17 <lufimtse>	Interesting
Jan 05 11:05:21 <lufimtse>	I didn't know -2 sticks around
Jan 05 11:05:26 <lufimtse>	thanks for information
Jan 05 11:06:10 <akurtakov>	np :)
Jan 05 11:06:32 <akurtakov>	I struggled with people setting -2 and having to chase them to unset it 
Jan 05 11:06:41 <akurtakov>	so I rather keep people informed :)
Jan 05 11:07:11 <lufimtse>	makes sense
Jan 05 11:07:19 <lufimtse>	I've added it to my "things to teach interns" list.
Jan 05 11:07:47 <akurtakov>	haha, good :)
Jan 05 11:09:03 <lufimtse>	btw
Jan 05 11:09:21 <lufimtse>	yesterday I dug around about   browserFunction returning a value to javascript. 
Jan 05 11:09:29 <lufimtse>	There really doesn't seem to be away.
Jan 05 11:09:40 <lufimtse>	It might be a potential limitation in the webkit2 port.
Jan 05 11:09:57 <lufimtse>	Or I might have to do some extensive hacking :-)
Jan 05 11:10:05 <lufimtse>	anyhow, just fyi, stage 2 might take a while.
Jan 05 11:10:05 <lufimtse>	I
Jan 05 11:10:09 <akurtakov>	deliver the previous part
Jan 05 11:10:10 <lufimtse>	I'll work on stage 1 for now.
Jan 05 11:10:59 <lufimtse>	core limitation is that the javascript call to C is asynchronous, so for it to get a return value it would have to somehow call contex_iteration() from within javascript.
Jan 05 11:11:12 <lufimtse>	or I'd have to find some synchronous method to call C from javascript.
Jan 05 11:11:14 <lufimtse>	just fyi.
Jan 05 11:11:23 <lufimtse>	Will worry about it later.
Jan 05 11:11:24 <lufimtse>	he he.
Jan 05 11:13:09 <akurtakov>	what is the async method ?
Jan 05 11:13:16 <lufimtse>	postMessage
Jan 05 11:13:28 <akurtakov>	?
Jan 05 11:13:38 <lufimtse>	https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitUserContentManager.html#WebKitUserContentManager-script-message-received
Jan 05 11:13:44 <lufimtse>	the callback signal handler is async
Jan 05 11:13:52 <lufimtse>	javascript does :
Jan 05 11:14:02 <lufimtse>	window.webkit....postMessage()
Jan 05 11:14:06 <lufimtse>	postMessage() is async
Jan 05 11:14:11 <lufimtse>	so it returns right away
Jan 05 11:14:44 <lufimtse>	The old implementation called a javacore method: JSObjectMakeFunctionWithCallback  
Jan 05 11:15:16 <lufimtse>	but that is not provided by webkit2 api. I'd have to investigate if there is a way to call it in webkit2. Might require some IPC for that to work. Not sure yet.
Jan 05 11:15:34 <lufimtse>	just thought I'd mention.
Jan 05 11:15:42 <akurtakov>	ok
Jan 05 14:18:32 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/88112/1  << my appologies, one of my patch sets didn't come through.
Jan 05 14:18:44 <lufimtse>	or forgot to add to staged changes. That one was half baked.
Jan 05 14:18:59 <lufimtse>	I shall be more attentive.
Jan 05 14:19:00 <akurtakov>	np I commented :)

[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-117-147.ams2.redhat.com]
Jan 18 10:04:09 <lufimtse>	morning
Jan 18 10:04:11 <lufimtse>	still around?
Jan 18 10:50:01 <akurtakov>	yes
Jan 18 10:50:02 <akurtakov>	what's up
Jan 18 10:50:09 <lufimtse>	helllo
Jan 18 10:50:10 <lufimtse>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=510538
Jan 18 10:50:11 <lufimtse>	this guy
Jan 18 10:50:23 <lufimtse>	I found the root cause of the business
Jan 18 10:50:35 <lufimtse>	I was mistaken about the return value, it's the 'double' that's causing issues.
Jan 18 10:50:41 <lufimtse>	Lemmme explain
Jan 18 10:50:50 <lufimtse>	With this callback:
Jan 18 10:50:51 <lufimtse>	void user_function (GtkGestureZoom *controller, gdouble scale, gpointer user_data)
Jan 18 10:50:56 <lufimtse>	The user_data is put into "scale". Data from scale is lost and user_data contains garbage. This is the reason we investigated callback with custom signature.
Jan 18 10:51:04 <lufimtse>	I investigated
Jan 18 10:51:17 <lufimtse>	I read through callback.c (native part)
Jan 18 10:51:36 <akurtakov>	wait a bit
Jan 18 10:52:07 <lufimtse>	...
Jan 18 10:52:22 <lufimtse>	callback.c : 1163    callback(int index, ...)
Jan 18 10:52:41 <lufimtse>	going down, there is this line: va_start(vl, index);
Jan 18 10:53:00 <lufimtse>	which basically shifts arguments ( http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdarg/va_start/ )
Jan 18 10:53:26 <lufimtse>	I found that va_start(..) doesn't shift arguments properly for doubles if method signature is incorrect
Jan 18 10:53:52 <akurtakov>	can you point me to the java side of this user funtion?
Jan 18 10:53:59 <akurtakov>	in general
Jan 18 10:54:10 <lufimtse>	as per: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33638661/va-arg-not-working-with-doubles
Jan 18 10:54:12 <lufimtse>	hey
Jan 18 10:54:19 <akurtakov>	where where gdouble * is needed
Jan 18 10:54:51 <lufimtse>	you mean where does Ian use the double?
Jan 18 10:54:56 <akurtakov>	you have to use double[] and set/read double[0]
Jan 18 10:55:34 <lufimtse>	do we have an example of this?
Jan 18 10:56:25 <akurtakov>	see e.g. Cairo.cairo_get_current_point
Jan 18 10:56:31 <akurtakov>	and it's usages
Jan 18 10:57:14 <lufimtse>	that's different
Jan 18 10:57:15 <lufimtse>	https://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Paths.html#cairo-get-current-point
Jan 18 10:57:19 <lufimtse>	that's a pointer to a double
Jan 18 10:57:27 <lufimtse>	in Ian's case the double is a value
Jan 18 10:57:35 <akurtakov>	that's why I ask for details :)
Jan 18 10:57:41 <lufimtse>	X-D
Jan 18 10:57:42 <lufimtse>	my bad
Jan 18 10:57:56 <lufimtse>	this is the signature
Jan 18 10:57:57 <lufimtse>	https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.18/GtkGestureZoom.html#GtkGestureZoom-scale-changed
Jan 18 10:58:05 <lufimtse>	the unique point is: gdouble         scale,
Jan 18 10:58:09 <lufimtse>	I.e, non-pointer double
Jan 18 10:58:15 <akurtakov>	ok
Jan 18 10:58:17 <lufimtse>	I looked through existing signals. (not all, but many_
Jan 18 10:58:21 <lufimtse>	none of them have double
Jan 18 10:58:25 <lufimtse>	this is the first one
Jan 18 10:58:46 <lufimtse>	I think the problem is with va_star().. in callback.c
Jan 18 10:58:48 <akurtakov>	I really don't wnat to see the reflection based approach
Jan 18 10:58:57 <lufimtse>	how about providing signature manually?
Jan 18 10:59:02 <lufimtse>	patch #1
Jan 18 10:59:04 <lufimtse>	more effective
Jan 18 10:59:07 <lufimtse>	and works also
Jan 18 10:59:18 <akurtakov>	as it  may cause issue at sometime when someone adds a method on java side
Jan 18 10:59:28 <akurtakov>	definetely not looking towards such things
Jan 18 10:59:42 <lufimtse>	I see
Jan 18 10:59:51 <lufimtse>	too complex, ok.
Jan 18 11:00:01 <lufimtse>	how about patch #1 where you provide signature manually?
Jan 18 11:00:10 <lufimtse>	it's efficent
Jan 18 11:00:13 <lufimtse>	no reflection
Jan 18 11:00:16 <akurtakov>	sec, let's me look into it
Jan 18 11:01:18 <lufimtse>	basically give a method like:    void method(int, double), you also have to provide signature like: (ID)V
Jan 18 11:02:33 <lufimtse>	advantage of patch #1 is that it's fast.
Jan 18 11:02:47 <lufimtse>	because it doesn't have to look for method in class
Jan 18 11:03:21 <akurtakov>	further more - it's safe as breakage will not happen due to method addition
Jan 18 11:03:47 <lufimtse>	btw
Jan 18 11:04:01 <lufimtse>	what is the concern about method addition?
Jan 18 11:04:04 <lufimtse>	and breakage
Jan 18 11:04:06 <lufimtse>	with reflection approach?
Jan 18 11:04:19 <lufimtse>	in patch #2, if it finds duplicate methods, it throws an error.
Jan 18 11:04:29 <akurtakov>	exactly
Jan 18 11:04:39 <akurtakov>	this will end up in runtime error
Jan 18 11:05:07 <lufimtse>	well, in patch #1 you would silently override one callback with another
Jan 18 11:05:19 <lufimtse>	at least in patch #2 there'd be a warning
Jan 18 11:05:34 <lufimtse>	like if in java you have 2 methods with same name
Jan 18 11:05:38 <lufimtse>	and register it twice
Jan 18 11:05:46 <lufimtse>	then the second registered method will get everything
Jan 18 11:05:52 <lufimtse>	potentially
Jan 18 11:06:00 <lufimtse>	not sure...
Jan 18 11:06:02 <lufimtse>	hmm
Jan 18 11:06:23 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Jan 18 11:07:13 *	akurtakov tried to think :)
Jan 18 11:07:17 <lufimtse>	he he
Jan 18 11:07:21 <lufimtse>	ok, lemme elaborate
Jan 18 11:07:40 <lufimtse>	Am I correct to understand that your concern is duplicate callbacks with the same name in a single class?
Jan 18 11:08:18 <akurtakov>	well, I was more concerned of method used for callback and another one used for other purposes sharing same name
Jan 18 11:08:37 <lufimtse>	so like:
Jan 18 11:08:45 <lufimtse>	mycallback(int, int)
Jan 18 11:08:49 <lufimtse>	mycallback(int,double)
Jan 18 11:08:51 <lufimtse>	?
Jan 18 11:08:57 <akurtakov>	yup
Jan 18 11:09:03 <lufimtse>	ok so:
Jan 18 11:09:49 <lufimtse>	lemme think.
Jan 18 11:11:47 <lufimtse>	I see
Jan 18 11:11:57 <lufimtse>	patch 1# callback would still work, new method could be added
Jan 18 11:12:04 <lufimtse>	patch 2#, error be thrown.
Jan 18 11:12:14 <lufimtse>	in the situation of duplicate method names.
Jan 18 11:12:31 <lufimtse>	then again
Jan 18 11:12:39 <lufimtse>	hmm
Jan 18 11:12:43 <akurtakov>	so my concern had some merit ?
Jan 18 11:12:49 <lufimtse>	true, 
Jan 18 11:12:58 <lufimtse>	but having same name for a callback is bad practice
Jan 18 11:13:04 <akurtakov>	I know 
Jan 18 11:13:05 <lufimtse>	C doesn't do overloading
Jan 18 11:13:14 <lufimtse>	but valid concern never the less.
Jan 18 11:13:21 <akurtakov>	but think of the next intern starting
Jan 18 11:13:33 <lufimtse>	How about option 3:
Jan 18 11:13:52 <akurtakov>	and adding function that already exists while fixing non callback related bug
Jan 18 11:13:57 <akurtakov>	reviewer misses that
Jan 18 11:14:02 <akurtakov>	boom :) 
Jan 18 11:14:06 <lufimtse>	provide method signature in form of a user friendly array:   ["void", "int", "double"] and the callback would generate proper signature.
Jan 18 11:14:22 <lufimtse>	that's like effectiveness of patch #1
Jan 18 11:14:27 <akurtakov>	and it can happen way later as it may happen only on given signal rarely uses
Jan 18 11:14:27 <lufimtse>	and user friendlyness of patch #2
Jan 18 11:14:45 <lufimtse>	^ How about I write patch #3 as per above?
Jan 18 11:14:54 <akurtakov>	let's discuss a bit more first
Jan 18 11:14:56 <lufimtse>	ok
Jan 18 11:15:09 <akurtakov>	how does gboolean works now
Jan 18 11:15:14 <akurtakov>	any issues with it
Jan 18 11:15:36 <lufimtse>	there is a callback that uses it
Jan 18 11:15:40 <lufimtse>	that we have
Jan 18 11:15:42 <lufimtse>	sec
Jan 18 11:16:27 <lufimtse>	https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkTreeView.html#GtkTreeView-expand-collapse-cursor-row
Jan 18 11:16:31 <lufimtse>	We use that signal
Jan 18 11:17:18 <lufimtse>	it trimms user_data
Jan 18 11:17:38 <lufimtse>	seems like gboolean works
Jan 18 11:17:52 <lufimtse>	I think it's because gboolean is small in memory
Jan 18 11:18:10 <lufimtse>	it seems gdouble is our problem child
Jan 18 11:18:18 <akurtakov>	well double should not exceed long
Jan 18 11:18:24 <lufimtse>	yea,
Jan 18 11:18:41 <lufimtse>	but va_args doesn't work with double if method signature doesn't match as per: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33638661/va-arg-not-working-with-doubles
Jan 18 11:18:48 <lufimtse>	I can't fix va_arg
Jan 18 11:18:50 <lufimtse>	:-)
Jan 18 11:19:11 <lufimtse>	so
Jan 18 11:19:18 <lufimtse>	e> void user_function (GtkGestureZoom *controller, gdouble scale, gpointer user_data)
Jan 18 11:19:28 <lufimtse>	Here we have that user_data resides in "scale"
Jan 18 11:19:34 <lufimtse>	it appears that va_arg is to blame
Jan 18 11:19:39 <lufimtse>	there is some shifting error.
Jan 18 11:19:45 <lufimtse>	in arguments
Jan 18 11:19:46 <akurtakov>	let me read on it
Jan 18 11:19:58 <lufimtse>	va_start docu: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdarg/va_start/
Jan 18 11:20:16 <lufimtse>	relevant swt code:   callback.c:1218
Jan 18 11:22:49 <akurtakov>	weird that the example in the docs is with double
Jan 18 11:23:30 <lufimtse>	the reason that works is because they provide double
Jan 18 11:23:34 <lufimtse>	in va_arg call
Jan 18 11:23:47 <akurtakov>	while we do int/long?
Jan 18 11:24:07 <lufimtse>	int
Jan 18 11:24:16 <lufimtse>	jintLong callback(int index, ...)
Jan 18 11:24:43 <lufimtse>	I could try to change that to long and see what happens :-)
Jan 18 11:25:03 <akurtakov>	could be 
Jan 18 11:25:11 <akurtakov>	as double will exceed the int
Jan 18 11:26:36 <lufimtse>	hmm
Jan 18 11:26:39 <lufimtse>	maybe to jintLong
Jan 18 11:27:42 <lufimtse>	should I try with Ian's patch?
Jan 18 11:27:47 <akurtakov>	please do
Jan 18 11:27:49 <lufimtse>	ok
Jan 18 11:27:53 <akurtakov>	I'm curious of the results
Jan 18 11:27:57 <lufimtse>	he he
Jan 18 11:36:57 <akurtakov>	this is good refresh of C memories :)
Jan 18 11:37:01 <lufimtse>	he he
Jan 18 11:37:02 <akurtakov>	I'll be back later
Jan 18 11:37:09 <lufimtse>	ok
Jan 18 11:37:12 <lufimtse>	btw
Jan 18 11:37:16 <lufimtse>	failing va_args investigation
Jan 18 11:37:22 <lufimtse>	should I work on option 3?
Jan 18 11:37:30 <lufimtse>	if *
Jan 18 11:38:10 <akurtakov>	we can try 
Jan 18 11:38:21 <akurtakov>	we scratched 2)
Jan 18 11:38:26 <lufimtse>	ok
Jan 18 14:09:56 <akurtakov>	so what's the result of the tests?
Jan 18 14:27:31 <lufimtse>	We tried a bunch of different combinations (jintlong, long, double. ..) in various places, but the user_data was not being put into the proper place
Jan 18 14:27:40 <lufimtse>	so I'm working on option 3
Jan 18 14:27:44 <akurtakov>	ok
Jan 18 15:05:58 <akurtakov>	still here?
Jan 18 15:06:03 <lufimtse>	yea
Jan 18 15:06:04 <lufimtse>	sup
Jan 18 15:06:12 <lufimtse>	almost done with patch #3
Jan 18 15:06:15 <lufimtse>	just typing up javadoc
Jan 18 15:06:19 <akurtakov>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=510647
Jan 18 15:07:38 <akurtakov>	you have this multiple gtk versions setup right?
Jan 18 15:07:44 <lufimtse>	yea
Jan 18 15:07:48 <lufimtse>	all the way to gtk3.4
Jan 18 15:07:55 <akurtakov>	I'm interested in whether the issue happens with gtk 3.4 under fedora
Jan 18 15:08:08 <lufimtse>	ok, I'll test out.
Jan 18 15:08:22 <akurtakov>	and if yes whether my change to 3.6 is enough
Jan 18 15:08:30 <akurtakov>	please comment on the bug
Jan 18 15:08:52 <akurtakov>	patch being uploaded as we speak
Jan 18 15:09:18 <lufimtse>	Ok, I'll pin down which version works/breaks.
Jan 18 15:09:22 <lufimtse>	will let you know.
Jan 18 15:09:26 <akurtakov>	thanks
Jan 18 15:10:00 <akurtakov>	yet again a case where I wish I wouldn't have changed things for older versions
Jan 18 15:10:01 <akurtakov>	sigh
Jan 18 15:10:20 <lufimtse>	I'm starting to see your point about old version business.
Jan 18 15:10:22 <lufimtse>	:-)
Jan 18 15:10:27 <lufimtse>	he he. 
Jan 18 15:10:52 <lufimtse>	A while back I build a script to run jUnits across different gtk versions
Jan 18 15:11:05 <lufimtse>	but with me working on webkit and eric being away, it's gotten a bit neglected.
Jan 18 15:11:12 <lufimtse>	I could revive it after I'm done with webkit2 port
Jan 18 15:11:20 <lufimtse>	and run jUnits against all gtk versions for patch reviews.
Jan 18 15:11:24 <lufimtse>	to catch these pesky things.
Jan 18 15:12:05 <akurtakov>	even that's not enough
Jan 18 15:12:38 <akurtakov>	you see some shitty distros like ubuntu install additional gtk modules which creates many issues like that
Jan 18 15:12:41 <akurtakov>	and so on
Jan 18 15:12:57 <akurtakov>	and you can't run all versions on all distros
Jan 18 15:13:07 <akurtakov>	simply not feasible
Jan 18 15:13:15 <akurtakov>	from my experience
Jan 18 15:13:34 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Jan 18 15:13:37 <akurtakov>	only 1 out of 3 bugs reported by ubuntu users are reproducible on fedora :)
Jan 18 15:13:37 <lufimtse>	so I have gtk3.6
Jan 18 15:13:41 <lufimtse>	I see
Jan 18 15:13:52 <lufimtse>	on fedora 3.6 doesn't seem to reproduce with current master
Jan 18 15:13:57 <lufimtse>	lemme compile 3.4
Jan 18 15:22:31 <akurtakov>	how long would that take ?
Jan 18 15:22:38 <akurtakov>	I mean should I wait for it now?
Jan 18 15:22:46 <lufimtse>	Missing some packages for compiling 3.4
Jan 18 15:22:49 <lufimtse>	working on getting those
Jan 18 15:22:54 <lufimtse>	meh
Jan 18 15:23:00 <lufimtse>	having trouble compiling ancient gtk build
Jan 18 15:23:13 <lufimtse>	might take me 10-20 mins.
Jan 18 15:26:00 <lufimtse>	skipping missing print libs.
Jan 18 15:26:05 <lufimtse>	...
Jan 18 15:26:10 <lufimtse>	compiling .. . ..
Jan 18 15:26:26 *	lufimtse pleased with pci-e compilation time.
Jan 18 15:33:21 <akurtakov>	heh nice :)
Jan 18 15:35:17 <lufimtse>	ok
Jan 18 15:35:20 <lufimtse>	compilation finished
Jan 18 15:35:23 <lufimtse>	tested snippet
Jan 18 15:35:27 <lufimtse>	on 3.4 funny size
Jan 18 15:35:30 <lufimtse>	of 200 by 200
Jan 18 15:35:33 <lufimtse>	on 3.6 life is good.
Jan 18 15:35:38 <lufimtse>	wooooot
Jan 18 15:35:40 <lufimtse>	lol
Jan 18 15:35:58 <lufimtse>	we should deprecate 3.4
Jan 18 15:36:04 <akurtakov>	so patch is good
Jan 18 15:36:13 <lufimtse>	Me +2 it.
Jan 18 15:36:14 <lufimtse>	sec
Jan 18 15:36:15 <lufimtse>	actually
Jan 18 15:36:18 <lufimtse>	haven't seen patch
Jan 18 15:36:43 <akurtakov>	deprecating gtk  3.4  version before 2.24 would complicate the codebase even further
Jan 18 15:36:58 <lufimtse>	true
Jan 18 15:37:03 <lufimtse>	I blessed your patch
Jan 18 15:37:14 <akurtakov>	not to speak for initial loading where we would have to make people with 3.4 downgrade to 2.24 which is a total no-go
Jan 18 15:37:34 <akurtakov>	would you please comment on the bug ?
Jan 18 15:37:39 <lufimtse>	ah yea.
Jan 18 15:37:40 <akurtakov>	with the tests you run
Jan 18 15:37:44 <lufimtse>	should I merge the thing?
Jan 18 15:37:48 <lufimtse>	while I'm at it?
Jan 18 15:37:49 <akurtakov>	and the findings
Jan 18 15:37:59 <akurtakov>	feel free to do so
Jan 18 15:38:13 <lufimtse>	ok,
Jan 18 15:38:15 <lufimtse>	backporting?
Jan 18 15:38:21 <lufimtse>	forgot, is backport branch frozen?
Jan 18 15:38:27 <akurtakov>	not yet
Jan 18 15:38:55 <akurtakov>	Feb 7
Jan 18 15:39:04 <akurtakov>	is the branch freeze date
Jan 18 15:39:19 <akurtakov>	so you want me to backport it now
Jan 18 15:42:26 <lufimtse>	yy
Jan 18 15:42:31 <lufimtse>	I'm gonna merge
Jan 18 15:42:32 <lufimtse>	sec
Jan 18 15:44:24 <akurtakov>	so please push it 
Jan 18 15:44:40 <lufimtse>	We're good.
Jan 18 15:44:41 <lufimtse>	pushed.
Jan 18 15:44:58 <lufimtse>	When I tested your patch, I only tested it with 3.6
Jan 18 15:45:11 *	lufimtse made a note to test with 3.4 so long as it's supported.
Jan 18 15:45:45 <lufimtse>	I mean when I tested the shell patch initially a while back.
Jan 18 15:45:54 <lufimtse>	I didn't think there was anyone in the world still using 3.4
Jan 18 15:45:54 <akurtakov>	that's normal
Jan 18 15:45:57 <lufimtse>	I was wrong lol.
Jan 18 15:46:07 <akurtakov>	tbh, I don't care for anything older than 3.14 
Jan 18 15:46:28 <akurtakov>	and soon it will be 3.22 :)
Jan 18 15:47:03 *	akurtakov can't wait for next rhel 7 which should have it
Jan 18 16:18:27 <lufimtse>	ok
Jan 18 16:18:29 <lufimtse>	so we have: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/89047/
Jan 18 16:18:32 <lufimtse>	version 3
Jan 18 16:18:39 <lufimtse>	User friendly and efficent.
Jan 18 16:22:55 <akurtakov>	cursory read lookd good
Jan 18 16:26:32 <lufimtse>	ok
Jan 18 16:26:38 <lufimtse>	Ian is testing it with his patch
Jan 19 10:16:27 <lufimtse>	morning
Jan 19 10:16:29 <lufimtse>	you still around?

Jan 19 12:46:39 <lufimtse>	hullo
Jan 19 12:46:46 <lufimtse>	my laptop was used for presentation
Jan 19 12:46:50 <lufimtse>	for canadian benefits
Jan 19 12:47:07 <lufimtse>	My tripple boot came in handy, (I have windows as a 3rd OS)
Jan 19 12:47:16 <lufimtse>	Only laptop in the office that had windows lol.
Jan 19 12:47:25 <lufimtse>	Thanks for feedback on patch. 
Jan 19 12:47:29 <lufimtse>	I submitted alternative
Jan 19 12:47:37 <lufimtse>	works around freeze up issue for now.
Jan 19 12:47:46 <lufimtse>	should fix all freeze up issues theoretically actually.
Jan 19 12:47:55 <lufimtse>	unless fault is in usercode.
Jan 19 12:48:24 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/89116
Jan 19 12:48:55 <lufimtse>	* Windows was needed by the lady who came in to do the presentation. (She was from insurance company).
Jan 19 12:51:19 <akurtakov>	doh, you shouldn't help her
Jan 19 12:51:34 <akurtakov>	and make her feel ashamed coming to linux company demoing on windows
Jan 19 12:58:39 <akurtakov>	shouldn't we close https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=510183 
Jan 19 12:58:46 <akurtakov>	as duplicate of the close bug 
Jan 19 13:01:09 <akurtakov>	merged the patch but the bug should stay open 
Jan 19 13:01:24 <lufimtse>	he he 
Jan 19 13:01:28 <akurtakov>	as close() still needs to be implemented
Jan 19 13:01:36 <lufimtse>	nah
Jan 19 13:01:39 <lufimtse>	let's leave open for now. 
Jan 19 13:01:45 <lufimtse>	I want to verify it's actually resolved.
Jan 19 13:01:49 <akurtakov>	btw, what's the status of the browser.function
Jan 19 13:01:52 <lufimtse>	getting there
Jan 19 13:01:55 <lufimtse>	so
Jan 19 13:01:57 <lufimtse>	meaning
Jan 19 13:02:03 <lufimtse>	got javascript execution to work on swt
Jan 19 13:02:07 <lufimtse>	but fiddling with details
Jan 19 13:02:11 <lufimtse>	like passing data around
Jan 19 13:02:22 <lufimtse>	linking the callback to the user java function
Jan 19 13:02:32 <akurtakov>	ok
Jan 19 13:02:36 <lufimtse>	got sidetracked by the callback for Ian's guesture patch
Jan 19 13:02:40 <lufimtse>	he was kinda stuck on it for a while
Jan 19 13:02:54 <akurtakov>	ok
Jan 19 13:03:00 <akurtakov>	both are kind of important :)
Jan 19 13:03:04 <lufimtse>	The JNI book that I read came in handy.
Jan 19 13:03:06 <lufimtse>	:-)
Jan 19 13:03:19 <akurtakov>	so I can't give priority to any of the two
Jan 19 13:03:27 <lufimtse>	ok.
Jan 19 13:03:28 <akurtakov>	tbh, 
Jan 19 13:03:39 <lufimtse>	yea, it's always one of these things. I thought the callback thing would take me 2 hours.
Jan 19 13:03:41 <lufimtse>	3 days later....
Jan 19 13:03:58 <akurtakov>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JB8xizXnT0 describes me now :)
Jan 19 13:04:36 <lufimtse>	He he he 
Jan 19 13:04:48 <akurtakov>	there is smth for a "young fighter" 
Jan 19 13:04:58 <akurtakov>	so anyone can pickup role :)
Jan 20 14:39:59 <lufimtse>	hullo, I sent you email. If you have 2-3 minutes, I'd be awesome if you could get back to me today. 
Jan 20 14:40:03 <lufimtse>	sorry to rush

Jan 20 16:45:24 <lufimtse>	You have epic email handling skills.

Jan 23 12:56:28 <lufimtse>	I got browser function to pass all the function jUnits (except the one that requires java to return something back to C).
Jan 23 12:56:33 <lufimtse>	this is a good thing.
Jan 23 12:56:39 <lufimtse>	Now need to tidy code

Feb 07 10:36:04 <lufimtse>	He he 
Feb 07 10:36:16 <lufimtse>	Ok, let's disscuss plan of attach, do you have a few mins?
Feb 07 10:36:23 <akurtakov>	yes
Feb 07 10:36:32 <akurtakov>	my next call is in 24 mins :)
Feb 07 10:36:40 <lufimtse>	I will link the signal fix to newly created bug: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=511797
Feb 07 10:36:52 <lufimtse>	And add jUnits for that signal fix
Feb 07 10:37:02 <lufimtse>	that should make code base better
Feb 07 10:37:05 <lufimtse>	and patches more reviewable
Feb 07 10:37:35 <akurtakov>	there are few other things I want to point out
Feb 07 10:37:48 <akurtakov>	in shared code incl. tests
Feb 07 10:38:04 <lufimtse>	this guy?https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=511797
Feb 07 10:38:13 <akurtakov>	there shouldn't be comments/differences based on what we run on
Feb 07 10:39:04 <lufimtse>	I see
Feb 07 10:39:07 <akurtakov>	as if we get comments about webkitgtk1, webkitgtk2, ie, mozilla, safari, webkitwin....
Feb 07 10:39:12 <akurtakov>	it would become insane
Feb 07 10:39:38 <akurtakov>	comments in tests should be about what is the expected behavior/what is tested
Feb 07 10:39:53 <akurtakov>	if we have to exclude smth that should be temp :)
Feb 07 10:40:02 <lufimtse>	ah
Feb 07 10:40:03 <lufimtse>	make sense
Feb 07 10:40:09 <lufimtse>	thank you for pointing that out
Feb 07 10:40:14 <lufimtse>	kinda forgot about OSX/win32
Feb 07 10:40:35 <lufimtse>	Ok, about this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/90451/  should I break it up into multiple commits?
Feb 07 10:41:34 <akurtakov>	definetely
Feb 07 10:41:44 <akurtakov>	I can't review such thing
Feb 07 10:41:49 <lufimtse>	indeed
Feb 07 10:41:57 <akurtakov>	I mean try opening the diff and look at it :)
Feb 07 10:42:22 <lufimtse>	Ok, that commit splits a few test cases, renames a bunch and moves them around. I'll create a bunch of commits to make each one more understandable
Feb 07 10:42:40 <lufimtse>	(It all makes sense in my mind ^_^)
Feb 07 10:42:42 <lufimtse>	he he
Feb 07 10:42:48 <lufimtse>	yah, diff is hard to read..
Feb 07 10:42:48 <lufimtse>	true
Feb 07 10:43:23 <lufimtse>	Ok, lemme roll up sleves and break things up a bit.
Feb 07 10:43:28 <lufimtse>	thank you for feedback.
Feb 07 10:43:34 <lufimtse>	Much appreciated.
Feb 07 10:43:39 <akurtakov>	np
Feb 07 10:44:15 <akurtakov>	I don't hesitate to point such things
Feb 07 10:45:02 <lufimtse>	:-D
Feb 07 10:45:07 <akurtakov>	it's mostly a matter of habbits to do these things in a way others understand
Feb 07 10:45:19 <akurtakov>	not about any special technical capabilities
Feb 07 10:55:09 <lufimtse>	Indeed
Feb 07 10:55:29 <lufimtse>	Quite often things I learn perculate down to interns
Feb 07 10:55:39 <lufimtse>	I see Eric/Ian doing same thing as me

Feb 07 10:58:08 <akurtakov>	yeah
Feb 07 10:58:46 <akurtakov>	it takes some time to learn looking at your stuff with the eyes of a stranger :)
Feb 07 10:58:54 <lufimtse>	OH YEA
Feb 07 10:59:03 <lufimtse>	Very true
Feb 07 10:59:46 <akurtakov>	one more hint 
Feb 07 10:59:52 <lufimtse>	mmm?
Feb 07 11:00:11 <akurtakov>	try to have fewer patches in the queue
Feb 07 11:00:22 <lufimtse>	Yes
Feb 07 11:00:24 <akurtakov>	aka rather get one in than two
Feb 07 11:00:29 <akurtakov>	more in the queue
Feb 07 11:00:32 <lufimtse>	I've been thinking about this yesterday
Feb 07 11:00:32 <akurtakov>	call time 
Feb 07 11:00:34 <akurtakov>	ttyl
Feb 07 11:01:00 <lufimtse>	thanks for pointing this out. I realised it get's confusing when one has many reviews pending.

Feb 08 10:44:43 <akurtakov>	what's going on with 
Feb 08 10:44:51 <akurtakov>	double params ?
Feb 08 11:00:10 <lufimtse>	hey
Feb 08 11:00:13 <lufimtse>	investigating
Feb 08 11:01:01 <akurtakov>	now is the time to give you an advice
Feb 08 11:01:16 <akurtakov>	prep your next easy patch so it can be reviewed while you investigate
Feb 08 11:01:25 <akurtakov>	multi tasking :)
Feb 08 11:08:26 <lufimtse>	he he he 
Feb 08 11:09:06 <lufimtse>	It seems that the double-paramater business still has issues. I.e, the arguments are shifted correctly, but double are not read properly.
Feb 08 11:09:24 <lufimtse>	will have to hunt down bug probably in callback.c
Feb 08 11:09:41 <lufimtse>	I'm working on a large-ish patch that fixes the evaluate() deadlock issue atm. 
Feb 08 11:09:47 <lufimtse>	would probably need a few days to finish that. 
Feb 08 11:09:53 <lufimtse>	So I guess I"ll do some multitasking.
Feb 08 12:30:12 <lufimtse>	---------
Feb 08 12:30:13 <lufimtse>	question
Feb 08 12:30:23 <lufimtse>	I need maybe 3 days to finish deadlock patch for webkit
Feb 08 12:30:41 <lufimtse>	but the double/callback thing came up for ian's guesture patch
Feb 08 12:30:58 <lufimtse>	should I do double/callback business after deadlock patch?
Feb 08 14:47:29 <akurtakov>	yes
Feb 08 14:47:47 <lufimtse>	ok
Feb 08 14:48:03 <akurtakov>	please try to keep me feeded with things to review everyday :)
Feb 08 14:48:37 <akurtakov>	we are at that stage of the cycle where we have to optimize for maximum things to get in
Feb 08 14:48:43 <akurtakov>	even if it means smalle ones
Feb 08 15:07:35 <akurtakov>	btw, the new approach worked quite well
Feb 08 15:07:38 <akurtakov>	pushed :)
Feb 08 15:08:02 <lufimtse>	kewl
Feb 08 15:08:34 <lufimtse>	I'm close to being done with the deadlock fix. Just kinda got stuck on a small bit on freeing up a pointer.
Feb 08 15:08:36 <lufimtse>	working on it.
Feb 08 15:08:45 <akurtakov>	perfect
Feb 08 15:08:55 <akurtakov>	I can take more things for review tomorrow :)
Feb 08 15:09:04 <lufimtse>	okie
Feb 08 15:09:15 <lufimtse>	I'll have something prepped.
Feb 08 15:09:53 <akurtakov>	good
Feb 08 15:09:58 <akurtakov>	and good night :)
Feb 08 15:10:09 <lufimtse>	night night.

Feb 09 15:03:54 <lufimtse>	hey ya
Feb 09 15:03:58 <lufimtse>	about to send you an email
Feb 09 15:04:00 <lufimtse>	for 3 patch review.
Feb 09 15:04:01 <lufimtse>	s
Feb 09 15:04:08 <lufimtse>	Got the deadlock fix working.
Feb 09 15:04:15 <lufimtse>	just need to package the thing now.
Feb 09 15:04:17 <lufimtse>	sup?
Feb 09 15:04:21 <akurtakov>	is it normal to have all test_browserfunction_callback tests failing locally ?
Feb 09 15:04:26 <akurtakov>	with webkit2
Feb 09 15:04:32 <lufimtse>	no
Feb 09 15:04:37 <lufimtse>	don't fail for me?
Feb 09 15:04:44 <akurtakov>	well they do for me :)
Feb 09 15:04:47 <lufimtse>	oh god.
Feb 09 15:05:01 <lufimtse>	What do you get?
Feb 09 15:05:20 <akurtakov>	well, assertionFailureerror
Feb 09 15:05:30 <lufimtse>	You rebuild bindings and all?
Feb 09 15:05:31 <akurtakov>	thanks to the empty fail() methods in the codebase
Feb 09 15:06:25 <akurtakov>	hmm, I didn't thought this is needed :)
Feb 09 15:06:35 <lufimtse>	yah
Feb 09 15:06:37 <akurtakov>	as there are no changes in the natives :)
Feb 09 15:06:48 <lufimtse>	lemme htink,
Feb 09 15:07:54 <lufimtse>	there aer
Feb 09 15:09:04 <lufimtse>	whole bunch
Feb 09 15:09:17 <lufimtse>	WebkitGTK.java is a native
Feb 09 15:09:54 <akurtakov>	well, I'm on master so everything should have been rebuilt
Feb 09 15:10:01 <akurtakov>	anyway, rebuilt and no change
Feb 09 15:10:23 <lufimtse>	hmm
Feb 09 15:10:27 <lufimtse>	all work for me,
Feb 09 15:10:34 <lufimtse>	hmmmm
Feb 09 15:10:52 <akurtakov>	funny enough - they are fine separately
Feb 09 15:11:06 <lufimtse>	Like if you run them one by one?
Feb 09 15:11:07 <akurtakov>	but not when running Test_org_eclipse_swt_browser_Browser
Feb 09 15:11:48 <lufimtse>	Lemme check on Ian's machine
Feb 09 15:12:02 <akurtakov>	yeah, run them 1 by 1 they are fine
Feb 09 15:12:14 <akurtakov>	run the whole test class - failures
Feb 09 15:14:02 <akurtakov>	btw, I don't feel comfortable pushing close before the other fix and break the javadoc hover 
Feb 09 15:14:14 <akurtakov>	this should go in the same build with the fix for that
Feb 09 15:20:05 <lufimtse>	ok
Feb 09 15:20:12 <lufimtse>	can you try to close your eclipse and open again
Feb 09 15:20:15 <lufimtse>	then start tests
Feb 09 15:20:23 <lufimtse>	maybe there is a memory leak somewhere
Feb 09 15:20:51 <akurtakov>	and that would fix test running?
Feb 09 15:21:27 <lufimtse>	Well, let's see if tests run for you on a fresh eclipse
Feb 09 15:21:43 <lufimtse>	I'm gonna test running the test suite in loops.
Feb 09 15:21:59 <akurtakov>	stopped, started and first 2 callback tests are failing 
Feb 09 15:22:10 <akurtakov>	do they fail on Ian's pc?
Feb 09 15:22:12 <lufimtse>	no
Feb 09 15:22:23 <lufimtse>	can you try to *close* your eclipse
Feb 09 15:22:25 <lufimtse>	then open again?
Feb 09 15:22:27 <lufimtse>	then try the suite
Feb 09 15:22:36 <lufimtse>	then see if test pass/fail?
Feb 09 15:22:39 <akurtakov>	that's what I mean by stoopped/started
Feb 09 15:22:44 <lufimtse>	I see
Feb 09 15:23:09 <lufimtse>	what fedora are you running?
Feb 09 15:23:13 <akurtakov>	f25
Feb 09 15:23:18 <lufimtse>	which version of webkit2 does it print in title?
Feb 09 15:23:21 <lufimtse>	2.14.*?

Feb 09 15:28:00 <lufimtse>	sec
Feb 09 15:28:16 <akurtakov>	you have old one?
Feb 09 15:29:52 <lufimtse>	I had 2.14.1
Feb 09 15:30:00 <lufimtse>	I updated to 2.14.3, works still for me
Feb 09 15:30:10 <akurtakov>	hmm, you're not updating your system regularly ?
Feb 09 15:30:22 <lufimtse>	I'm too busy fixing webkit X-D
Feb 09 15:30:40 <akurtakov>	you should do that every week
Feb 09 15:30:52 <lufimtse>	I see
Feb 09 15:31:19 <akurtakov>	for the sake of not trying to fix things that could have been already fixed elsewhere
Feb 09 15:31:31 <lufimtse>	makes sense
Feb 09 15:31:33 <akurtakov>	you're on f25, right ?
Feb 09 15:31:38 <lufimtse>	yea
Feb 09 15:31:43 <lufimtse>	although haven't updated my system in a while.
Feb 09 15:32:04 <lufimtse>	Let me do a full system update and see if tests still work for me.
Feb 09 15:32:18 <akurtakov>	and ask Ian to do the same too :)
Feb 09 15:32:28 <lufimtse>	1.3 GB >_>
Feb 09 15:32:33 <akurtakov>	:)
Feb 09 15:32:45 <akurtakov>	this must have been quite a time :)
Feb 09 15:33:16 <lufimtse>	I patch my kernal with bits to allow my mac to shutdown
Feb 09 15:33:18 <lufimtse>	and sleep
Feb 09 15:33:26 <lufimtse>	so I'm lazy about updates
Feb 09 15:33:34 <lufimtse>	because I have to reapply kernel patches
Feb 09 15:33:41 <akurtakov>	I'm updating too and will reboot to see things are fine 
Feb 09 15:33:55 <lufimtse>	I think I should not shutdown my mac lol.
Feb 09 15:33:56 <akurtakov>	btw, you can update everything else but kernel :)
Feb 09 15:34:04 <lufimtse>	ah yea?
Feb 09 15:35:02 <lufimtse>	interesting
Feb 09 15:35:03 <akurtakov>	syntax was smth like 'dnf --exclude=kernel update'
Feb 09 15:35:07 <lufimtse>	dnf update -x kernel-*
Feb 09 15:35:12 <lufimtse>	found
Feb 09 15:35:17 <lufimtse>	that would make life easier.

Feb 09 16:00:28 <lufimtse>	hey
Feb 09 16:00:32 <lufimtse>	Updated my whole system
Feb 09 16:00:34 <lufimtse>	still works
Feb 09 16:00:37 <lufimtse>	I tried AllTests
Feb 09 16:00:43 <lufimtse>	only testBrowser2 and 5 failed
Feb 09 16:00:53 <lufimtse>	all other 3502 tests worked, including function
Feb 09 16:00:54 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Feb 09 16:01:05 <lufimtse>	tried a reboot?
Feb 09 16:01:10 <akurtakov>	yup
Feb 09 16:01:16 <akurtakov>	just logged in
Feb 09 16:01:16 <lufimtse>	still broken for you?
Feb 09 16:01:20 <akurtakov>	yes
Feb 09 16:01:38 <akurtakov>	you do run tests with webkit2 right?
Feb 09 16:01:39 <lufimtse>	sec
Feb 09 16:02:08 <lufimtse>	yea
Feb 09 16:11:11 <lufimtse>	hey
Feb 09 16:11:20 <lufimtse>	Was troubleshooting Jeff's eclipse set up
Feb 09 16:11:26 <lufimtse>	He updated to F25
Feb 09 16:11:29 <lufimtse>	eclipse stopped working
Feb 09 16:11:37 <lufimtse>	turns out he was running wayland
Feb 09 16:11:41 <lufimtse>	and eclipse on wayland is flaky
Feb 09 16:11:47 <lufimtse>	hmm
Feb 09 16:12:02 <lufimtse>	maybe we should force x11 on swt level until SWT on wayland is more usable
Feb 09 16:12:17 <akurtakov>	we already do that in fedora packages
Feb 09 16:12:25 <lufimtse>	that's fedora, not upstream thou.
Feb 09 16:12:31 <lufimtse>	if people download from upstream
Feb 09 16:12:35 <lufimtse>	eclipse be broke.
Feb 09 16:12:44 <akurtakov>	let's consider it after M7
Feb 09 16:12:50 <lufimtse>	ok
Feb 09 16:12:51 <akurtakov>	I hope we can fix it by then
Feb 09 16:12:54 <lufimtse>	he he
Feb 09 16:12:58 <akurtakov>	what is Jeff using ?
Feb 09 16:13:02 <akurtakov>	4.6.2?
Feb 09 16:13:04 <lufimtse>	I moved him back to x11
Feb 09 16:13:12 <lufimtse>	and gave him pat on the back.
Feb 09 16:13:13 <akurtakov>	or 4.7 I-build
Feb 09 16:13:16 <lufimtse>	oxygen
Feb 09 16:13:19 <lufimtse>	M* something
Feb 09 16:13:20 <akurtakov>	hmm
Feb 09 16:13:24 <akurtakov>	so what was the issue
Feb 09 16:13:25 <lufimtse>	his buttons were still cut off
Feb 09 16:13:30 <lufimtse>	so not latest by the looks
Feb 09 16:13:42 <lufimtse>	pops up with "SWT unhandled event loop*
Feb 09 16:13:47 <lufimtse>	after 2 mins
Feb 09 16:14:01 <lufimtse>	and eclipse dies
Feb 09 16:14:03 <akurtakov>	he should move to M6
Feb 09 16:14:08 <akurtakov>	err, M5
Feb 09 16:14:16 <akurtakov>	and see whether it still happens
Feb 09 16:14:40 <lufimtse>	Well, he'll bump into the other known wayland issues probably
Feb 09 16:14:49 <akurtakov>	true
Feb 09 16:15:01 <akurtakov>	but we will know that he is not experiencing other issues 
Feb 09 16:15:10 <lufimtse>	imho we have some fixes to do before asking users to use eclipse on wayland
Feb 09 16:15:14 <lufimtse>	but dunnow
Feb 09 16:15:20 <lufimtse>	maybe our team be an exception
Feb 09 16:15:23 <lufimtse>	as we're eclipse developers
Feb 09 16:15:27 <akurtakov>	Jeff is not "Joe The user "
Feb 09 16:15:28 <akurtakov>	:)
Feb 09 16:15:36 <lufimtse>	He is when it comes to swt
Feb 09 16:15:38 <lufimtse>	:-)
Feb 09 16:15:58 <lufimtse>	I think he likes his setup stable
Feb 09 16:16:00 <lufimtse>	but meh
Feb 09 16:16:01 <lufimtse>	anyhows
Feb 09 16:16:04 <lufimtse>	the webkit2 business
Feb 09 16:16:10 <lufimtse>	so it works on my and ian's system
Feb 09 16:16:14 <akurtakov>	ok
Feb 09 16:16:14 <lufimtse>	but not with you
Feb 09 16:16:19 <lufimtse>	if you run tests in suite?
Feb 09 16:16:23 <akurtakov>	continue with what you have 
Feb 09 16:16:46 <lufimtse>	Can you think of anything special about your system?
Feb 09 16:17:03 <akurtakov>	no
Feb 09 16:17:36 <lufimtse>	Hmm. My system is pretty basic also, like just gnome, firefox and eclipse
Feb 09 16:17:56 <lufimtse>	lemme think.
Feb 09 16:18:14 <lufimtse>	Do you give your eclipse extra ram?
Feb 09 16:18:19 <lufimtse>	lemme try to launch my ecipse with little ram
Feb 09 16:18:21 <akurtakov>	no
Feb 09 16:18:30 <akurtakov>	I stick to defaults
Feb 09 16:19:12 <lufimtse>	I give my eclipse like 4 gb
Feb 09 16:19:18 <lufimtse>	lemme try defaults
Feb 09 16:20:03 <lufimtse>	ok still works.
Feb 09 16:20:14 <lufimtse>	Any way I can remote into your system somehow over night?
Feb 09 16:20:16 <lufimtse>	or something
Feb 09 16:20:27 <lufimtse>	or complicated?
Feb 09 16:20:37 <lufimtse>	don't actually know how to do that.
Feb 09 16:20:37 <lufimtse>	meh
Feb 09 16:20:50 <akurtakov>	nah
Feb 09 16:20:55 <akurtakov>	just finish what you're doing
Feb 09 16:20:58 <lufimtse>	ok
Feb 09 16:21:59 <akurtakov>	I see things like Error scanning plugin /usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins/libevbrowserplugin.so, /usr/libexec/webkit2gtk-4.0/WebKitPluginProcess returned 256 exit status in my console
Feb 09 16:22:08 <lufimtse>	I see that as well
Feb 09 16:22:12 <lufimtse>	not sure why those popup
Feb 09 16:22:17 <lufimtse>	I should investigate I guess
Feb 09 16:22:39 <lufimtse>	maybe we're not closing webkit properly.
Feb 09 16:23:51 <lufimtse>	Ok, I gotta run. Will try to package eval-dead-lock fix tomorrow. (it's kinda big..).
Feb 10 10:13:21 *	Disconnected (Connection reset by peer)
Feb 10 11:42:14 <akurtakov>	do you have anything for review ?
Feb 10 11:42:29 <lufimtse>	hey ya
Feb 10 11:42:36 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Feb 10 11:43:04 <lufimtse>	I'm trying to write a test case for deadlock issue. But test case deadlocks whole test suite.
Feb 10 11:43:21 <lufimtse>	experimenting with @Test(timeout=xxxx)  annotation.
Feb 10 11:43:54 <lufimtse>	but that throws errors about being on wrong thread
Feb 10 11:43:58 <lufimtse>	I'm having lots of fun X-D
Feb 10 11:44:03 <lufimtse>	hopefully later tonight.

Feb 13 09:17:13 <akurtakov>	hey Leo
Feb 13 09:17:18 <lufimtse>	morning
Feb 13 09:17:25 <akurtakov>	how are things
Feb 13 09:17:30 <lufimtse>	good good
Feb 13 09:17:47 <lufimtse>	in short
Feb 13 09:17:50 <lufimtse>	in long 
Feb 13 09:18:12 <lufimtse>	there is a corner case where solving the deadlock is a bit tricky
Feb 13 09:18:14 <lufimtse>	but solvable
Feb 13 09:18:28 <lufimtse>	I was thinkinging of doing one approach for all signals
Feb 13 09:18:40 <lufimtse>	but some signals require a return value
Feb 13 09:18:54 <lufimtse>	so my initial approach to post-pone SWT listener firing won
Feb 13 09:19:01 <lufimtse>	won't work with 1 or 2 of the signals
Feb 13 09:19:07 <lufimtse>	but should work for other signals
Feb 13 09:19:21 <lufimtse>	basically I have to go through each signal one by one and ensure it doesn't deadlock
Feb 13 09:19:28 <akurtakov>	sigh
Feb 13 09:19:30 <lufimtse>	there are around 8 or so
Feb 13 09:19:39 <lufimtse>	or 10
Feb 13 09:19:57 <lufimtse>	but it's not a blocker, just takes a little longer
Feb 13 09:20:09 <akurtakov>	do you have other things in the queue ?
Feb 13 09:20:14 <lufimtse>	I was hoping to have the patch ready, but having to go throuh each signal step by step may take me a little bit more time.
Feb 13 09:20:29 <lufimtse>	Gotta fix up the callback thing for Ian's patch
Feb 13 09:20:38 <lufimtse>	but webkit2 seems close to getting done.
Feb 13 09:20:47 <akurtakov>	well, I hope so :0
Feb 13 09:54:44 <lufimtse>	small patch: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/90959/
Feb 13 10:10:53 <lufimtse>	I also found that my jUnits for browser seem to behave a bit different on each platform.
Feb 13 10:11:13 <lufimtse>	I should ideally setup win/cocoa for testing my jUnits to make sure they don't break other platforms...
Feb 13 10:11:20 <lufimtse>	but maybe later...
Feb 13 10:11:31 <lufimtse>	now busy.
Feb 13 10:32:52 <akurtakov>	[17:28] <akurtakov> hey
Feb 13 10:32:54 <akurtakov>	[17:28] <akurtakov> sure supporting wayland ongtk 3.22 makes sense to me
Feb 13 10:32:55 <akurtakov>	[17:31] <akurtakov> hmm
Feb 13 10:32:57 <akurtakov>	[17:31] <akurtakov> try me still opens the new window

Feb 13 10:34:20 <lufimtse>	hey
Feb 13 10:34:55 <lufimtse>	on webkit1 it opens the window, on webkit2 it blocks the popup
Feb 13 10:35:06 <lufimtse>	i forgot to add it to commit msg,
Feb 13 10:35:10 <lufimtse>	but i left a note in bug

Feb 14 12:10:18 <akurtakov>	hey
Feb 14 12:10:29 <akurtakov>	so the deadlock patch is ready for review?
Feb 14 14:37:25 <lufimtse>	hello
Feb 14 14:37:29 <lufimtse>	work in progress 
Feb 14 14:37:32 <lufimtse>	kinda big.
Feb 14 14:37:42 <lufimtse>	somewhat intricate.
Feb 14 14:46:11 <akurtakov>	ok. let me know if/when ready for review
Feb 14 14:46:18 <lufimtse>	ok
Feb 14 14:48:02 <lufimtse>	I'm not deadlocked on the patch thou X-D. I'm making steady progress.
Feb 14 14:49:09 <lufimtse>	Making SWT's synchronous API work well with Webkit2's asynchronous api requires careful tinkering.
Feb 14 14:49:29 <lufimtse>	For example I found that two separate webkit2 instances can still interfere with each other's locks.
Feb 14 14:49:47 <akurtakov>	that's where I bet on people having enough time to think it deeply :)
Feb 14 14:49:55 <lufimtse>	X-D
Feb 14 14:50:04 <akurtakov>	and not be like me - a butterfly jumping from flower to flower :)
Feb 14 14:50:13 <lufimtse>	he he
Feb 14 14:50:50 <akurtakov>	I would say you can't complain of not having time to think about things proper, can you :) 
Feb 14 14:51:01 <lufimtse>	X-D, lot's of time.
Feb 14 14:51:23 <lufimtse>	I've spent the first couple of months learning a lot about JNI/webkit. Kinda got rolling later in sept/oct
Feb 14 14:51:47 <lufimtse>	now I understand JNI/webkit quite well, it's all about getting the patches out there.
Feb 14 16:14:45 <lufimtse>	----
Feb 14 16:14:47 <lufimtse>	ping
Feb 14 16:14:56 <lufimtse>	quick question: do you know if we have a bottom version of Webkit1?
Feb 14 16:16:56 <akurtakov>	look at which version is the first that requires gtk 2.24 I would say 
Feb 14 16:17:05 <lufimtse>	aha
Feb 14 16:17:10 <lufimtse>	thanks
Feb 14 16:17:19 <akurtakov>	and feel free to let me know
Feb 14 16:17:26 <lufimtse>	X-D, ok
Feb 14 16:17:47 <lufimtse>	I'm bumping into some old logic mixed in with new logic. 
Feb 14 16:17:49 <lufimtse>	fixing.
Feb 14 16:27:20 <akurtakov>	second thought - think of latest webkitgtk supported the version right before gtk 2.24.0 was released
Feb 14 16:27:25 <akurtakov>	that should be fairer :)
Feb 14 16:27:41 <lufimtse>	I see
Feb 14 16:27:58 <lufimtse>	On second thought, I better not touch webkit1.
Feb 14 16:28:06 <lufimtse>	just if (WEBKIT2) guards
Feb 14 16:28:12 <lufimtse>	X-D
Feb 14 16:28:25 <lufimtse>	Minor thing anyway
Feb 14 16:28:30 <lufimtse>	about title listener, not so important.
Feb 14 16:28:42 <akurtakov>	well, if it's with really ancient we would better drop it 
Feb 14 16:29:19 <lufimtse>	nah, I was thinking i needed a if (<1.1.4) guard, but after some more research I don't anyomae
Feb 14 16:29:22 <lufimtse>	anymore*
Feb 14 16:29:32 <lufimtse>	so at the moment I don't need to research min version anymore.
Feb 14 16:29:50 <lufimtse>	for now
Feb 14 16:29:55 <lufimtse>	lazy evaluation *
Feb 14 16:30:00 <lufimtse>	may investigate if there is a need.
Feb 15 13:10:07 <lufimtse>	----
Feb 15 13:10:18 <lufimtse>	hello, I emailed you some patch review work
Feb 15 13:10:37 <lufimtse>	might keep you busy for a while :-).
Feb 15 13:11:16 <lufimtse>	With that deadlock fix, I think we should be ok to make webkit2 as default. Although it wouldn't hurt to run eclipse with the patch for a few days firts.
Feb 15 13:11:18 <lufimtse>	first.
Feb 15 13:11:40 <lufimtse|lunch>	back after lunch.
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-116-40.ams2.redhat.com]
Feb 15 14:12:47 <akurtakov>	pushing 
Feb 15 14:23:45 <akurtakov>	here?
Feb 15 14:38:21 <lufimtse|lunch>	hello
Feb 15 14:38:39 <lufimtse>	nice
Feb 15 14:38:55 <akurtakov>	and found out there is 32/64 bit issues
Feb 15 14:39:01 <lufimtse>	derp
Feb 15 14:39:03 <lufimtse>	ill fix
Feb 15 14:39:20 <akurtakov>	how ddi you not see it before that ?
Feb 15 14:39:46 <akurtakov>	further more I wonder why I haven't seen it in ther first place
Feb 15 14:40:23 <akurtakov>	I guess it's the cast GError without = that made swttools misbehave
Feb 15 14:40:27 <akurtakov>	please fix that too
Feb 15 14:40:40 <akurtakov>	and never put additional lines between the native and java method
Feb 15 14:41:48 <akurtakov>	anyway, I want this in so we can make smaller incremental improvements from now on
Feb 15 14:42:27 <lufimtse>	ok
Feb 15 14:42:38 <akurtakov>	webkit_web_view_run_javascript declaration is the faulty one
Feb 15 14:42:54 <lufimtse>	I think for some reason my 32/64 bit check was off.
Feb 15 14:43:01 <akurtakov>	please let me know when you have the patch ready
Feb 15 14:43:05 <lufimtse>	ok.
Feb 15 14:50:50 <akurtakov>	so will it be fast thing to do?
Feb 15 14:52:25 <lufimtse>	give me 5-10 mins.
Feb 15 14:52:30 <akurtakov>	ok
Feb 15 14:52:41 <akurtakov>	will update/reboot the machine meanwhile :)
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-116-35.ams2.redhat.com]
Feb 15 15:11:44 <akurtakov>	should we think of revert ?
Feb 15 15:12:02 <lufimtse>	nah
Feb 15 15:12:05 <lufimtse>	almost done.
Feb 15 15:12:17 <lufimtse>	had to change bunch of bits for the 32/64 bit business.
Feb 15 15:12:26 <lufimtse>	the javadoc between native and regular function doesn't cause breakage
Feb 15 15:12:34 <lufimtse>	only methods with *native* get barsed
Feb 15 15:12:38 <lufimtse>	get parsed*
Feb 15 15:12:52 <akurtakov>	so it was the missing = ?
Feb 15 15:12:55 <lufimtse>	yea
Feb 15 15:13:05 <lufimtse>	the cast was broken
Feb 15 15:13:11 <lufimtse>	but it didn't cause swt tools to miss it.
Feb 15 15:13:15 <lufimtse>	was different.
Feb 15 15:14:01 <lufimtse>	I initially had the cast working, but must have deleted the '=' by accident somewhere.
Feb 15 15:14:13 <lufimtse>	because I recall the natives having the GError cast at one point.
Feb 15 15:18:16 <akurtakov>	it's getting late for me
Feb 15 15:18:35 <akurtakov>	I trust on you either pushing a fix or reverting the commit so tomorrows build is not broken
Feb 15 15:18:50 <lufimtse>	ok
Feb 15 15:19:03 <lufimtse>	fix will be in 2 mins. I'll merge.
Feb 15 15:19:19 <akurtakov>	make sure that all tests work after that too :)
Feb 15 15:19:27 <lufimtse>	X-D,
Feb 15 15:19:32 <lufimtse>	yea, I'm testing this thing to death.
Feb 15 15:26:20 <akurtakov>	btw do you test webkit2 under both x11 and wayland ?
Feb 15 15:26:33 <lufimtse>	x11 so far
Feb 15 15:26:39 <lufimtse>	I should test under wayland
Feb 15 15:26:49 <lufimtse>	kinda forgot to think about that.
Feb 15 15:27:00 <lufimtse>	I'll do some testing
Feb 15 15:27:27 <akurtakov>	tbh, would expect better results under wayland than x11 nowadays :)
Feb 15 15:27:34 <akurtakov>	but still has to be checked
Feb 15 15:27:36 <lufimtse>	X-D
Feb 15 15:28:10 <lufimtse>	Ok, I pushed the 32bit fix
Feb 15 15:28:11 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/91213/
Feb 15 15:28:19 <lufimtse>	SWT tools doesn't show any other 32 bit errors.
Feb 15 15:28:22 <lufimtse>	should be good.
Feb 15 15:28:43 <lufimtse>	I'll test things on wayland also, to see if all tests pass and if there is any difference in behaviour on child eclipses on wayland etc...
Feb 15 15:34:59 <akurtakov>	so when you say you test under x11
Feb 15 15:35:07 <akurtakov>	this means gnome on x11 
Feb 15 15:35:16 <akurtakov>	or launching via GDK_BACKEND=x11
Feb 15 15:57:21 <lufimtse>	at the moment I'm on x11 on my desktop
Feb 15 15:57:34 <lufimtse>	wayland had glitches with multi-monitor setup
Feb 15 15:57:41 <lufimtse>	when f25 first came out
Feb 15 15:57:52 <lufimtse>	so 3+ monitors deadlocked gnome.
Feb 15 15:57:57 <lufimtse>	I have 3 monitors + laptop screen.
Feb 15 15:58:06 <lufimtse>	But I think they fixed it a month ago
Feb 15 15:58:15 <lufimtse>	I could potentially switch over to wayland now.
Feb 15 15:58:34 <lufimtse>	been too focused on getting the port done in time, ignored everything else X-D
Feb 15 15:58:45 <akurtakov>	oks
Feb 15 15:58:47 <lufimtse>	I tested newest master on Ian's machine, which runs wayland
Feb 15 15:58:50 <lufimtse>	test pass
Feb 15 15:58:51 <lufimtse>	life is good.
Feb 15 15:59:09 <akurtakov>	we will speak about my machine issues next week :)
Feb 15 15:59:10 <lufimtse>	tomorrow I'll pull the latest integration build and set eclipse to use webkit2 on my main machine.
Feb 15 15:59:14 <lufimtse>	I mean on my main build.
Feb 15 15:59:18 <lufimtse>	ok.
Feb 15 15:59:23 <lufimtse>	next week I'm off to moscow btw,
Feb 15 15:59:32 <akurtakov>	ah, so the week after that
Feb 15 15:59:47 <akurtakov>	if I don't speak to you - enjoy
Feb 15 15:59:51 <akurtakov>	I'm taking Friday off
Feb 15 15:59:56 <lufimtse>	ok
Feb 15 16:00:04 <lufimtse>	technically, that was the last big change to webkit2
Feb 15 16:00:05 *	akurtakov :No such nick/channel

Feb 16 13:01:44 <akurtakov>	hey Leo
Feb 16 13:01:49 <akurtakov>	what's this auth about ?
Feb 16 13:08:14 <lufimtse>	hello
Feb 16 13:08:15 <lufimtse>	ignore
Feb 16 13:08:20 <lufimtse>	I thought it wasn't working
Feb 16 13:08:21 <akurtakov>	I commented in the bug
Feb 16 13:08:23 <lufimtse>	but seems to work.
Feb 16 13:08:24 <akurtakov>	:)
Feb 16 13:12:21 <lufimtse>	thanks for link to that page
Feb 16 13:12:27 <lufimtse>	was loooking for something like that
Feb 16 13:12:33 <lufimtse>	:-D
Feb 16 13:13:34 <akurtakov>	enjoy
Feb 16 13:31:58 <akurtakov>	so are all bugs from https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/showdependencytree.cgi?id=441568&hide_resolved=1
Feb 16 13:32:03 <akurtakov>	still needed
Feb 16 13:32:18 <lufimtse>	lemme see
Feb 16 13:32:28 <lufimtse>	some
Feb 16 13:32:33 <lufimtse>	I need to to go through them
Feb 16 13:32:41 <lufimtse>	like the javascript option not implemented.
Feb 16 13:32:49 <lufimtse>	like you can't turn off javascript execution on webkit2 yet
Feb 16 13:32:53 <akurtakov>	bz sanitization is important
Feb 16 13:32:55 <lufimtse>	I know how to fix, just need a spare afternoon.
Feb 16 13:33:05 <lufimtse>	yea, all bugs are open still
Feb 16 13:33:17 <lufimtse>	it's more a question of how much time to dedicate to webkit2.
Feb 16 13:33:28 <lufimtse>	like we might consider ditching function part 2
Feb 16 13:33:34 <akurtakov>	well, all of your work hours :)
Feb 16 13:33:56 <lufimtse>	there might be some bits that will probably not used much
Feb 16 13:33:59 <lufimtse>	like function part 2.
Feb 16 13:34:09 <lufimtse>	might not be worth spending time on. 
Feb 16 13:34:26 <akurtakov>	I'm ok with you prioritizing them
Feb 16 13:34:36 <akurtakov>	but all the api has to be implemented :)
Feb 16 13:34:40 <lufimtse>	X-D
Feb 16 13:34:50 <akurtakov>	eventually
Feb 16 13:34:51 <akurtakov>	:)
Feb 16 13:35:09 <lufimtse>	there's some api that's not even implemented on webkit1.
Feb 16 13:35:15 <akurtakov>	I know that
Feb 16 13:35:20 <lufimtse>	like visibility listener hide()
Feb 16 13:35:45 <lufimtse>	I'm thinking maybe give wayland some love once webkit2 is in good shape.
Feb 16 13:36:01 <lufimtse>	but dunnow.
Feb 16 13:36:02 <akurtakov>	sure
Feb 16 13:36:20 <akurtakov>	once it's in good shape :)
Feb 16 13:36:25 <lufimtse>	X-D
Feb 16 13:36:42 <lufimtse>	Most of it is working now.
Feb 16 13:36:46 <lufimtse>	only 2 tests still fail.
Feb 16 13:36:53 <lufimtse>	gotta investigate why.
Feb 16 13:37:51 <lufimtse>	We might be ready for making webkit2 default, but I'm thinking it wouldn't hurt to run my eclipse with webkit2 for a while first.
Feb 16 13:38:04 <akurtakov>	I would not fllip it now even
Feb 16 13:38:09 <akurtakov>	too unsure
Feb 16 13:38:14 <akurtakov>	but you/me/Ian should use it
Feb 16 13:38:19 <lufimtse>	ok, 
Feb 16 13:38:40 <lufimtse>	I should have my main eclipse using webkit2 in a bit.
Feb 16 13:38:48 <lufimtse>	will see how well it works then.
Feb 16 13:38:51 <akurtakov>	and we flip it rifht after Oxygen is branched
Feb 16 13:39:39 <lufimtse>	ok
Feb 16 13:39:50 <akurtakov>	you see as long there are unfinished apis and webkitgtk3 widely available I lose my main point to convince the move
Feb 16 13:40:08 <lufimtse>	hmm
Feb 16 13:40:10 <lufimtse>	I see.
Feb 16 13:40:29 <lufimtse>	My concern is that function.part2 might be somewhat complex to implement.
Feb 16 13:40:32 <lufimtse>	there is no api.
Feb 16 13:40:34 <lufimtse>	on webkit2
Feb 16 13:40:40 <akurtakov>	sure leave that as last thing
Feb 16 13:40:42 <lufimtse>	I'd have to setup webkit2 extension. 
Feb 16 13:40:52 <lufimtse>	with inter process communication
Feb 16 13:40:57 <lufimtse>	might be hacky.
Feb 16 13:41:51 <lufimtse>	ok. For now I'll leave it till later.

Mar 07 12:11:31 <lufimtse>	Actually, I spent yesterday setting up the OSX and a Win10 VM for SWT testing. Like in the past I had issues with testing gerrit reviews, I could only run some snippets. But now I have a full testing setup. (except rebuild of bindings).

Mar 13 12:39:30 <akurtakov>	hey Leo
Mar 13 12:39:41 <akurtakov>	Ian told me he shown you the jdt bug
Mar 13 12:40:39 <lufimtse>	hey ya
Mar 13 12:40:41 <lufimtse>	we took a look
Mar 13 12:41:33 <lufimtse>	At a glance, we took a look at what could break it, but haven't found anything obvious. For instance in another place in eclipse editable table-editors work. We'd have to dissect the thing, take it apart until we find the root cause, which could take a while.
Mar 13 12:41:44 <lufimtse>	I could do it at some point,
Mar 13 12:44:32 <lufimtse>	Just say the word :-)
Mar 13 12:44:53 <lufimtse>	At the moment I'm fixing up the visibility listener event details, which is the reason 2-3 of the reamining browser tests are failing on webkit2.
Mar 13 12:45:05 <lufimtse>	broken because not ported over.
Mar 13 12:45:40 <lufimtse>	I need to write a bunch of asserts, so that if webkit1 calls are executed on webkit2, there'd be some kind of warning. At the moment it silently fails.
Mar 13 12:45:48 <akurtakov>	ok
Mar 13 12:46:11 <lufimtse>	I don't suppose you know of a way to make SWT scream in your face if you're calling a webkit1 only function on webkit2?
Mar 13 12:46:51 <akurtakov>	nope :)
Mar 13 12:46:58 <akurtakov>	and it's not supposed ot do so :)
Mar 13 12:47:34 <akurtakov>	this is a bug like arrayindexoutofbounds no need for user to know about it :)
Mar 13 12:47:55 <lufimtse>	ok.
Mar 13 12:48:30 <lufimtse>	Once I've fixed up visibility listener, I'll look for a way for it to do so such that it only shows for developers.
Mar 13 12:52:23 <lufimtse>	Btw. 
Mar 13 12:52:36 <lufimtse>	I've been running my eclipse with the latest webkit2 patches for a while. Works well.
Mar 13 12:52:46 <lufimtse>	At one point we have to consider when to switch.
Mar 13 12:52:57 <akurtakov>	for Photon M1
Mar 13 12:53:05 <akurtakov>	we missed the boat for Oxygen
Mar 13 12:53:52 <lufimtse>	I see.
Mar 13 12:54:01 <lufimtse>	Do you know roughly when Photon M1 comes out?
Mar 13 12:54:16 <akurtakov>	https://wiki.eclipse.org/Photon/Simultaneous_Release_Plan
Mar 13 12:54:42 <lufimtse>	Ok, that should be good.
Mar 13 12:55:01 <lufimtse>	I should have remaining broken jUnits fixed relativley soon.
Mar 13 12:57:27 <akurtakov>	good
Mar 13 12:57:50 <akurtakov>	go through all bugs about webkit2 and check them too
Mar 13 12:57:58 <lufimtse>	ok

Mar 16 12:37:28 <akurtakov>	hey Leo
Mar 16 12:37:38 <lufimtse>	hello
Mar 16 12:37:48 <akurtakov>	how are things?
Mar 16 12:38:00 <akurtakov>	wrappingup on webkit2?
Mar 16 12:38:45 <lufimtse>	The only big thing is the Browser.function() return value back to javascript. It's a very nieche corner case that's probably never actually used anywhere and would be time consuming to fix up.
Mar 16 12:38:56 <lufimtse>	I could spend some time trying to figure out if I can do this quick
Mar 16 12:39:00 <lufimtse>	or if it would be realllly messy
Mar 16 12:39:07 <lufimtse>	then evaluate based on possibilities
Mar 16 12:39:15 <akurtakov>	please do - we need at least clear evaluation of time needed
Mar 16 12:39:22 <lufimtse>	ok.
Mar 16 12:39:24 <akurtakov>	btw, please also run the tests on wayland
Mar 16 12:39:40 <lufimtse>	X-D
Mar 16 12:39:41 <akurtakov>	I see that test_StatusTextListener_hoverMouseOverLink is failing
Mar 16 12:39:41 <lufimtse>	ok.
Mar 16 12:39:43 <akurtakov>	:)
Mar 16 12:39:52 <lufimtse>	Yea, I kinda thought it would.
Mar 16 12:39:57 <lufimtse>	coordinate issue
Mar 16 12:40:00 <lufimtse>	will investigate.
Mar 16 12:41:51 <akurtakov>	after that I would like you to investigate the double click jdt issue
Mar 16 12:42:06 <lufimtse>	you mean with the edit box?
Mar 16 12:42:11 <akurtakov>	yeah
Mar 16 12:42:12 <lufimtse>	ok.
Mar 16 12:42:38 <akurtakov>	such issues are ruining my effort to remove gtk2 support :)
Mar 16 12:50:29 <lufimtse>	Ah,
Mar 16 12:50:47 <lufimtse>	btw, for me, the fact that drag-part doesn't show preview box seems pretty severe
Mar 16 12:51:13 <lufimtse>	thoughts?
Mar 16 12:51:23 <akurtakov>	ok, count it as your next task after the edit box :)
Mar 16 12:51:30 <lufimtse>	ok
Mar 16 12:51:51 <akurtakov>	thinking more about it - Photon would probably still have gtk2
Mar 16 12:52:01 <lufimtse>	yea
Mar 16 12:52:10 <lufimtse>	I kinda have a feeling gtk2 might stick around.
Mar 16 12:52:25 <akurtakov>	but I would remove  non-cairo drawing as first thing after branching :)

Mar 20 09:16:44 <lufimtse>	http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/I20170319-2000/testResults.php
Mar 20 09:16:44 <akurtakov>	Ian is at eclipsecon this week, right?
Mar 20 09:16:47 <lufimtse>	yea
Mar 20 09:16:55 <lufimtse>	wondering, which test failures to investigate?
Mar 20 09:16:57 <lufimtse>	all of them?
Mar 20 09:17:07 <lufimtse>	like there are no swt test failures, you mean the other projects?
Mar 20 09:18:02 <akurtakov>	http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/I20170319-2000/testresults/html/org.eclipse.ui.tests_ep47I-unit-cen64-gtk3_linux.gtk.x86_64_8.0.html
Mar 20 09:18:08 <akurtakov>	look for No more callbacks 
Mar 20 09:18:48 <akurtakov>	also in http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/I20170319-2000/testresults/html/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests_ep47I-unit-cen64-gtk3_linux.gtk.x86_64_8.0.html
Mar 20 09:19:05 <akurtakov>	this no more callbacks is really suspeciious
Mar 20 09:20:28 <lufimtse>	I see
Mar 20 09:20:46 <akurtakov>	if you run the tests one by one there is no issue
Mar 20 09:20:53 <akurtakov>	that's why I think it's a leak
Mar 20 09:21:02 <lufimtse>	hmm. I see
Mar 20 09:21:10 <lufimtse>	I'll investigate.
Mar 20 09:21:20 <lufimtse>	Can you reproduce on your sysetm?
Mar 20 09:21:26 <akurtakov>	no
Mar 20 09:21:34 <akurtakov>	but I haven't run all the tests as a suite

Mar 20 09:21:56 <akurtakov>	please give it highest prio 
Mar 20 09:22:03 <lufimtse>	ok, on it.
Mar 20 09:22:16 <akurtakov>	before someone decides to revert our precious wayland commit
Mar 20 09:22:17 <akurtakov>	:)
Mar 20 09:22:22 <lufimtse>	X-D
Mar 20 09:23:43 <akurtakov>	how are things otherwise ?
Mar 20 09:23:47 <akurtakov>	you doing good?
Mar 20 09:23:52 <akurtakov>	what about your arm ?
Mar 20 09:24:01 <akurtakov>	fully recovered now?
Mar 20 09:24:04 <lufimtse>	Fabulous. Been doing bench press at the gym
Mar 20 09:24:11 <lufimtse>	:-D
Mar 20 09:24:18 <lufimtse>	As good as new
Mar 20 09:24:20 <lufimtse>	maybe even better.
Mar 20 09:24:28 <lufimtse>	he he 
Mar 20 09:24:33 <akurtakov>	haha ok :)
Mar 20 09:27:37 <akurtakov>	maybe first investigate the code whether everything is properly cleared
Mar 20 09:28:44 <lufimtse>	Well, I'm just thinking that the guesture patch only uses the new callback signature in only 1 place
Mar 20 09:29:01 <lufimtse>	shouldn't affect other callbacks
Mar 20 09:29:04 <lufimtse>	but who knows
Mar 20 09:29:05 <lufimtse>	I'll check
Mar 20 09:29:19 <akurtakov>	but there is limit of callbacks that can be registered
Mar 20 09:29:25 <lufimtse>	that's true,
Mar 20 09:29:35 <akurtakov>	and once it's exceeded we will end up with this situation
Mar 20 09:29:41 <lufimtse>	Can those be increased, do you know/
Mar 20 09:29:47 <akurtakov>	no
Mar 20 09:29:56 <lufimtse>	that's odd
Mar 20 09:30:01 <akurtakov>	but it could probably mean we have to deregister them
Mar 20 09:30:23 <akurtakov>	or register statically
Mar 20 09:30:35 <akurtakov>	not sure what the proper path is without investigating
Mar 20 09:30:38 <lufimtse>	so the limit is on instance callbacks?
Mar 20 09:31:04 <lufimtse>	I"ll have to investigate the callback mechanism I guess
Mar 20 09:33:34 <akurtakov>	btw, feel free that it's smth else and fix it :)
Mar 20 09:33:38 <akurtakov>	fully working for me :)
Mar 20 09:34:47 <akurtakov>	for starters
Mar 20 09:35:06 <akurtakov>	can we move Callback dragReleaseCb = new Callback(control, "dragEndReleaseSelection", 2);  in the static on top
Mar 20 09:35:20 <akurtakov>	aka why does it need to receive the control as a paream
Mar 20 09:36:04 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Mar 20 09:36:14 <lufimtse>	so we can have as many 'static' callbacks as we like?
Mar 20 09:36:27 <akurtakov>	not as many
Mar 20 09:36:48 <akurtakov>	but being static means it would be one for all DragSource instances
Mar 20 09:36:56 <akurtakov>	and just be attached multiple times
Mar 20 09:37:05 <lufimtse>	oh, I see.
Mar 20 09:37:30 <lufimtse>	Do you know why there is a limit?
Mar 20 09:37:35 <akurtakov>	no
Mar 20 09:37:42 <akurtakov>	it's probably some gtk limitation
Mar 20 09:37:59 <lufimtse>	I saw something in callback.c about adding more lines if out of callback
Mar 20 09:38:07 <akurtakov>	and anyway registering hundreds of callbacks on widgets will destroy performance
Mar 20 09:38:11 <lufimtse>	maybe I could raise the callback count limit (in addition to moving things to static..)
Mar 20 09:38:21 <akurtakov>	let's go one by one
Mar 20 09:38:26 <akurtakov>	make it static first
Mar 20 09:38:43 <lufimtse>	ok. Static is a good idea, I didn't think of the performance gain there.
Mar 20 09:38:46 <lufimtse>	nice catch.
Mar 20 09:39:06 <akurtakov>	this is touchy area
Mar 20 09:39:23 <akurtakov>	so I would rather see multiple incremental improvements over try to redo everything
Mar 20 09:39:42 <akurtakov>	you haven't answer me why does it receive the control as a param?
Mar 20 09:39:44 <akurtakov>	any clue?
Mar 20 09:39:58 <lufimtse>	Lemme check
Mar 20 09:40:25 <lufimtse>	I recall helping Ian getting the callback to work
Mar 20 09:40:29 <lufimtse>	but forgot the details.
Mar 20 09:40:31 <lufimtse>	lemme see
Mar 20 09:47:11 <akurtakov>	this is pretty serious actually
Mar 20 09:47:31 <akurtakov>	being done that way means that a callback is created for every single Control
Mar 20 09:48:04 <lufimtse>	It was implemented without consideration that we had a limit on callbacks
Mar 20 09:48:12 <lufimtse>	I think it can be made static
Mar 20 09:48:48 <lufimtse>	lemmme fiddle around with that. Do you have any way to reproduce "no more callbacks" in any way?
Mar 20 09:49:06 <akurtakov>	maybe if you run the whole testsuite locally somehow
Mar 20 09:49:10 <akurtakov>	:)
Mar 20 09:49:14 <lufimtse>	for all projects?
Mar 20 09:49:24 <lufimtse>	or just one project?
Mar 20 09:49:30 <akurtakov>	just one of them
Mar 20 09:49:33 <lufimtse>	maven?
Mar 20 09:49:39 <lufimtse>	or in eclipse
Mar 20 09:49:48 <lufimtse>	I guess in eclipse should do
Mar 20 09:49:57 <akurtakov>	well, they are run in neither of these ways
Mar 20 09:50:00 <akurtakov>	but try in eclipse
Mar 20 09:50:19 <lufimtse>	Ok. If I can reproduce, it would be easier to tell if patch would fix things.
Mar 20 09:50:23 <lufimtse>	I'll work on it today.
Mar 20 09:50:32 <akurtakov>	even if it wouldn't
Mar 20 09:50:42 <akurtakov>	work on making it static first
Mar 20 09:50:45 <lufimtse>	ok
Mar 20 09:50:57 <lufimtse>	I feel the pressure X-D
Mar 20 09:51:08 <akurtakov>	it's important improvement anyway :)
Mar 20 09:51:11 <lufimtse>	yah
Mar 20 09:51:31 <lufimtse>	I should document that we should be careful with callbacks somewhere
Mar 20 09:51:38 <akurtakov>	well
Mar 20 09:51:45 <lufimtse>	the whole swt documentation would benefit from an overhaul somewhere
Mar 20 09:51:46 <akurtakov>	everytime created they should be destroyed
Mar 20 09:51:54 <lufimtse>	hmm
Mar 20 09:51:56 <lufimtse>	I see
Mar 20 09:52:02 <lufimtse>	I didn't think of that.
Mar 20 09:52:16 <akurtakov>	look at Devise.release
Mar 20 09:52:21 <akurtakov>	it disposes it's calbacks
Mar 20 09:53:06 <lufimtse>	ah
Mar 20 09:53:11 <lufimtse>	Callback.dispose
Mar 20 09:53:15 <lufimtse>	I see
Mar 20 09:53:52 <akurtakov>	but anyway being static is better than create/dispose for each widget
Mar 20 09:54:04 <lufimtse>	Hmm, I could add a static counter and at the end of a jUnit test inspect if its more than 0. That way I could tell if we have a leak.
Mar 20 09:54:13 <lufimtse>	while investigating
Mar 20 09:54:14 <akurtakov>	well, try it
Mar 20 09:54:27 <lufimtse>	ok
Mar 20 10:17:05 <akurtakov>	btw do you have some patches for review ?
Mar 20 10:17:25 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/93420/ << 
Mar 20 10:17:38 <lufimtse>	I finished it on friday, but just submitted it a minute ago.
Mar 20 10:18:29 <lufimtse>	There's a 'C.free()' that shouldn't be called by webkit2.
Mar 20 10:18:33 <lufimtse>	~Hazardous.
Mar 20 10:19:04 <lufimtse>	potentially cause of crash, but since crash occurs so rareley it's hard to tell.
Mar 20 10:19:09 <lufimtse>	It's a good start.
Mar 20 10:21:03 <akurtakov>	looks good
Mar 20 10:21:09 <akurtakov>	please push it
Mar 20 10:30:16 <lufimtse>	ok
Mar 20 11:19:04 *	Disconnected (Connection timed out)
Mar 20 11:50:49 <lufimtse>	I reproduced no more callbacks error with jdt tests. Working on fixing it now.
Mar 20 11:50:57 <akurtakov>	perfect
Mar 20 11:51:25 *	akurtakov should start MVP for Month X contests :)
Mar 20 11:51:50 <lufimtse>	what do you mean?
Mar 20 11:52:03 <akurtakov>	that you would probably win the March one :)
Mar 20 11:55:09 <lufimtse>	for which fix?
Mar 20 11:55:26 <akurtakov>	ah, it's not for one fix 
Mar 20 11:55:42 <akurtakov>	it's for amount of fixes and implications from them during the whole month
Mar 20 11:55:51 <akurtakov>	but the webkit2 formed quite nicely lately :)
Mar 20 11:56:11 <lufimtse>	I see. Webkit2 is shaping up bit by bit.
Mar 20 11:58:08 <akurtakov>	so what is your guess for the callback issue ?
Mar 20 11:58:19 <akurtakov>	I mean what kind of patch you work on 
Mar 20 11:58:23 *	akurtakov is just curious
Mar 20 11:59:14 <lufimtse>	Investigating how many instance callbacks are generated atm
Mar 20 11:59:20 <lufimtse>	out of curiosity
Mar 20 11:59:24 <lufimtse>	give me 5 mins.
Mar 20 11:59:28 <akurtakov>	ok
Mar 20 12:13:14 <lufimtse>	yea, I think you are correct with the callback in DnD logic. It is instantiated 156 times and never disposed.
Mar 20 12:13:25 <lufimtse>	Count goes up and at 156 it throws "no more callbacks".
Mar 20 12:13:30 <lufimtse>	Let me fix.
Mar 20 12:13:54 <lufimtse>	Like dnd instanted callback, not from other widgets.
Mar 20 12:20:09 <lufimtse>	I've ran all SWT tests with a simmilar approach, whereby keeping a counter in Callback.java. It seems we might have 1-2 more leaks other than dnd. But those are less noticable. I should ideally find those as well and also write a jUnit test that tests for leaks.
Mar 20 12:20:14 <lufimtse>	given the time.
Mar 20 12:20:27 <lufimtse>	It could run at the end to see if there are any non-disposed callbacks.
Mar 20 12:20:35 <lufimtse>	that way we'd catch them early.
Mar 20 12:20:40 <lufimtse>	just a thought...
Mar 20 12:44:12 <lufimtse>	----
Mar 20 12:44:12 *	akurtakov :No such nick/channel
Mar 21 09:49:50 <lufimtse>	goood morning
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-200-18.brq.redhat.com]
Mar 21 09:50:06 <akurtakov>	hey
Mar 21 09:50:11 <akurtakov>	what's up ?
Mar 21 10:01:22 <lufimtse>	Did you have a chance to see the patch?
Mar 21 10:01:25 <lufimtse>	was it ok?
Mar 21 10:01:33 <akurtakov>	yeah, it's just fine
Mar 21 10:01:33 <lufimtse>	Eric is in btw
Mar 21 10:01:36 <lufimtse>	ok'
Mar 21 10:01:46 <akurtakov>	say Hi to eric from me
Mar 21 11:12:10 <lufimtse>	I found another leak in display, also introduced by the DnD patch. 
Mar 21 11:12:39 <lufimtse>	I found it by writing a bit of a jUnit framework that finds memory leaks and prints the stacktrace of what was registered but not disposed.
Mar 21 11:12:43 <lufimtse>	Quite useful actually.
Mar 21 11:22:54 <akurtakov>	good
Mar 21 11:22:57 <akurtakov>	can we upstream this
Mar 21 11:23:39 <lufimtse>	Yea, I'll have to test on my OSX and Win32 box. Maybe I'll find some memory leaks there as well, who knows :-)
Mar 21 11:48:21 <lufimtse>	btw, do you know if there is a way to link directly to a gtk function?
Mar 21 11:48:31 <akurtakov>	what do you mean ?
Mar 21 11:48:37 <lufimtse>	like: g_signal_connect (win,"delete-event",                  G_CALLBACK (gtk_true),                    NULL);
Mar 21 11:48:43 <lufimtse>	in this case link to gtk_true
Mar 21 11:48:59 <akurtakov>	no idea
Mar 21 11:49:20 <akurtakov>	I would say your knowledge in the area is probably way better than mine now :)
Mar 21 11:49:27 <lufimtse>	X-D
Mar 21 11:49:42 <lufimtse>	just checking. Couldn't find an instance of this.
Mar 21 11:49:46 <lufimtse>	but would have use of.
Mar 21 12:55:35 <lufimtse>	I found a way of doing it. He he. Turns out in SWT there's one spot that does just that. I found it in os_custom.h. Will utilize a similar approach to fix memory leak. Patch incomming.
Mar 21 12:55:48 <akurtakov>	perfect
Mar 21 15:04:02 <lufimtse>	Still around or off?
Mar 21 15:06:14 <lufimtse>	~Assuming you're away.
Mar 21 15:33:16 <akurtakov>	what's up ?
Mar 21 15:33:24 <akurtakov>	I'm checking before going to bed :)
Mar 21 15:34:56 <lufimtse>	I was gonna ask you to review this guy: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/93568/ but figured you're in ZzZz land and pushed it. Feel free to review it tomorrow thou if you find anything quirky. There's an email in your inbox about it.
Mar 21 15:36:00 <akurtakov>	looks good to me
Mar 21 15:44:33 <akurtakov>	still here ?
Mar 21 15:44:36 <akurtakov>	https://ibin.co/3GMLWwmmkRF0.png
Mar 21 15:44:42 <akurtakov>	come with such setup 
Mar 21 15:44:43 <lufimtse>	yea
Mar 21 15:44:46 <akurtakov>	setup is fast view
Mar 21 15:45:01 <akurtakov>	search is fast view
Mar 21 15:45:19 <akurtakov>	try to click in the editor showing html content (webkit browser)
Mar 21 15:45:35 <akurtakov>	no focus gain lost and the fast view is not minimized
Mar 21 15:45:43 <lufimtse>	webkit2?
Mar 21 15:45:52 <akurtakov>	both :)
Mar 21 15:49:36 <akurtakov>	reproduced it?
Mar 21 15:49:49 <lufimtse>	working on it
Mar 21 15:50:07 <lufimtse>	drag parts doesn't seem to work very well with the recent dnd patch
Mar 21 15:50:07 <lufimtse>	meh
Mar 21 15:51:05 <akurtakov>	feel free to improve it :0
Mar 21 15:51:34 <lufimtse>	:-)
Mar 21 15:57:29 <lufimtse>	Hmm, yes, I can reproduce
Mar 21 15:58:48 <lufimtse>	Added it to my long todo list 
Mar 21 16:13:29 <akurtakov>	so what I think happens
Mar 21 16:13:39 <akurtakov>	is that due to it being webview
Mar 21 16:13:49 <lufimtse>	missing signal of sorts... 
Mar 21 16:13:53 <akurtakov>	it doesn't propagate focus
Mar 21 16:14:32 <lufimtse>	hmm
Mar 21 16:14:46 <lufimtse>	yea, probably that or mouse clicks don't get translated to focus events
Mar 21 16:14:49 <akurtakov>	and it needs some kind of domlistener 
Mar 21 16:15:09 <lufimtse>	mouse events I think work, but there might not be logic to translate signals

Mar 23 14:24:16 <akurtakov>	no
Mar 23 14:24:18 <lufimtse>	or you mean like it's in rawhide?
Mar 23 14:24:23 <akurtakov>	no

Mar 23 14:26:00 <lufimtse>	installing
Mar 23 14:27:11 <lufimtse>	I'm investigating the webkitextension business
Mar 23 14:27:22 <lufimtse>	might take a while.
Mar 23 14:27:27 <lufimtse>	learning up on dbus
Mar 23 14:27:28 <lufimtse>	etc..
Mar 23 14:27:31 <lufimtse>	will keep you posted.
Mar 23 14:27:35 <akurtakov>	ok
Mar 23 14:27:37 *	lufimtse testing newest webkit.
Mar 23 14:32:00 <lufimtse>	all is well
Mar 23 14:32:04 <akurtakov>	phew
Mar 23 14:32:05 <lufimtse>	tests pass. Eclipse works well.
Mar 23 14:32:07 <akurtakov>	first time :)
Mar 23 14:32:10 <lufimtse>	Life is good.
Mar 23 14:32:18 <lufimtse>	that is on x11 anyway
Mar 23 14:32:26 <lufimtse>	haven't switched my main system to wayland yet.
Mar 23 14:32:48 <lufimtse>	the plan was to finish the webkit2 port and then..
Mar 23 14:34:01 <lufimtse>	At the moment I'm investigating if the return value of the Browserfunction is used anywhere in eclipse/platform/jdt etc... Just to see how much it's actually needed.
Mar 23 14:34:20 <lufimtse>	s/how much/if at all

Mar 23 14:48:06 <lufimtse>	that's a valid use case
Mar 24 12:28:54 <lufimtse>	hullo hullo. I emailed you about BrowserFunction. When you have time.. ^_^

Mar 24 12:51:14 <akurtakov>	still here ?
Mar 24 12:54:01 <lufimtse>	hello
Mar 24 12:54:10 <lufimtse>	how goes
Mar 24 12:54:31 <akurtakov>	so webextensions are supposed to be easy to develop aren't they
Mar 24 12:54:45 <lufimtse>	Well
Mar 24 12:54:49 <akurtakov>	I just came to https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/03/24/migrating-adblock-firefox-webextensions/
Mar 24 12:54:53 <akurtakov>	 today
Mar 24 12:56:02 <lufimtse>	Firefox webextensions != Webkit2 webextensions
Mar 24 12:56:13 <lufimtse>	FF had an old mechanism for plugins
Mar 24 12:56:19 <lufimtse>	their webextensions is a new mechanisms
Mar 24 12:56:21 <akurtakov>	yeah, I know that
Mar 24 12:56:35 <akurtakov>	but it's supposed to be a step towards unification
Mar 24 12:57:12 <lufimtse>	I don't understand how Firefox webextensions relate to SWT/Webkit2??
Mar 24 12:57:14 <lufimtse>	meh?
Mar 24 12:57:17 <lufimtse>	Can you explain
Mar 24 12:57:27 <akurtakov>	they don't directly
Mar 24 12:57:35 <lufimtse>	Btw, did my email reach you?
Mar 24 12:57:36 <akurtakov>	but they are modeled after chrome webextensions
Mar 24 12:58:03 <akurtakov>	which are modeled after webkit webextensions if my memory serves me well :)
Mar 24 12:58:07 <akurtakov>	yeah I got your email
Mar 24 12:58:13 <lufimtse>	I was thinking along the lines of making a start with SWT/Webkit2 webextensions and see how things go in a week or two.
Mar 24 12:58:40 <lufimtse>	then judge progress as I go along.
Mar 24 12:59:00 <lufimtse>	If things look bright, carry on. If things will look gloomy, well, figure it out then.
Mar 24 12:59:20 <lufimtse>	It's just a time-commitment 
Mar 24 12:59:35 <lufimtse>	Thoughts?
Mar 24 12:59:37 <akurtakov>	well, it can't be delivered in Oxygen
Mar 24 12:59:49 <akurtakov>	so let's get some bugfixes for Oxygen done first
Mar 24 13:00:01 <akurtakov>	and once it's in end-game you work on that
Mar 24 13:00:02 <akurtakov>	ok?
Mar 24 13:00:16 <lufimtse>	Ok, so postpone webkit2 business for now and work on SWT bugfixes?
Mar 24 13:00:32 <akurtakov>	so jdt refactoring viewer in place edit please :)
Mar 24 13:00:39 <lufimtse>	X-D~!
Mar 24 13:00:45 <lufimtse>	ok

Mar 24 13:05:15 <akurtakov>	see my launcher to wayland reply
Mar 24 13:05:22 <akurtakov>	there is a lot more waiting for us there too
Mar 24 13:06:14 <lufimtse>	Interesting.
Mar 24 13:06:20 <lufimtse>	That could be something.
Mar 24 13:06:35 <lufimtse>	I've done some dynamic function calls in C in the initial webkit port.
Mar 24 13:06:41 <lufimtse>	May have to replicate that into the launcher.

Mar 31 10:03:28 <lufimtse>	yea
Mar 31 10:03:34 <lufimtse>	looking into the regression business
Mar 31 10:03:35 <lufimtse>	sup
Mar 31 10:03:49 <akurtakov>	so you have seen the bugs I've added you to
Mar 31 10:04:45 <lufimtse>	Still working on getting through my emails
Mar 31 10:05:06 <lufimtse>	Did you assign them to me in bugzilla?
Mar 31 10:05:22 <akurtakov>	no
Mar 31 10:05:26 <akurtakov>	I just added you on cc
Mar 31 10:05:36 <lufimtse>	ok, let me check my mail.
Mar 31 10:06:00 <akurtakov>	so you look at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=514531
Mar 31 10:06:16 <lufimtse>	Looking at it atm
Mar 31 10:09:38 <lufimtse>	btw, how did you pick up on the "no more callbacks" business a while back?
Mar 31 10:09:48 <lufimtse>	I check the jUnit test page on a daily basis
Mar 31 10:09:48 <lufimtse>	http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/I20170330-2000/testResults.php
Mar 31 10:09:50 <lufimtse>	for SWT issues
Mar 31 10:09:57 <lufimtse>	but I don't go through all the projects
Mar 31 10:10:03 <akurtakov>	:)
Mar 31 10:10:06 <akurtakov>	well, I do
Mar 31 10:10:26 <lufimtse>	:-O
Mar 31 10:10:35 <akurtakov>	as you know I'm on the PMC so almost everyday there are things about platform, pde, jdt and etc. in my list :)
Mar 31 10:10:47 <akurtakov>	and as a result I keep a monitor on everything
Mar 31 10:11:01 <lufimtse>	hmm, it would be very good if there'd be no failing test cases.
Mar 31 10:11:08 <lufimtse>	so we'd pick up on new failing tests quickly.
Mar 31 10:11:17 <akurtakov>	this work is good 1/3 of my time to stay on top of everything and pull the needed strings :)
Mar 31 10:11:31 <lufimtse>	X-D
Mar 31 10:13:21 <akurtakov>	btw, we got the tree headers in yesterday if you missed it :)
Mar 31 10:24:41 <akurtakov>	so how are things looking with the table viewer edit ?
Mar 31 10:24:48 <akurtakov>	can you figure the reparenting ?
Mar 31 10:25:14 <lufimtse>	I'm deep in gtk at the moment
Mar 31 10:25:50 <lufimtse>	something doesn't seem to work inside gtk with the reparenting
Mar 31 10:25:55 <lufimtse>	I'm experimenting with alternatives
Mar 31 10:26:02 <lufimtse>	like use a different child handle for reparenting
Mar 31 10:26:15 <lufimtse>	buts it's tricky
Mar 31 10:26:29 <lufimtse>	nice job on the table headers
Mar 31 10:26:32 <lufimtse>	It
Mar 31 10:27:37 <akurtakov>	well, my job was again pulling the strings
Mar 31 10:27:47 <akurtakov>	eric did the implementation :)
Mar 31 10:27:51 <akurtakov>	for gtk
Mar 31 10:28:03 <lufimtse>	ah
Mar 31 10:28:16 <lufimtse>	the launch configuration doesn't reproduce for me. Let me try older gtk versins.
Mar 31 10:28:37 <akurtakov>	launch config reproduces for me just fine
Mar 31 10:28:51 <lufimtse>	which eclipse build?
Mar 31 10:28:57 <akurtakov>	the thing is it is created but it doesn't get open inthe main panel
Mar 31 10:29:07 <akurtakov>	Build id: I20170330-2000
Mar 31 10:30:36 <lufimtse>	http://storage3.static.itmages.com/i/17/0331/h_1490970618_7836287_a3ba7e9bf9.png
Mar 31 10:30:46 <lufimtse>	when I double click, the thing expands and adds entries
Mar 31 10:30:52 <akurtakov>	yes
Mar 31 10:30:58 <akurtakov>	but look in the other panel
Mar 31 10:31:05 <akurtakov>	on the left
Mar 31 10:31:09 <akurtakov>	err on the right
Mar 31 10:31:24 <akurtakov>	the newly created launch config is open for edit there
Mar 31 10:31:29 <akurtakov>	this is what doesn't happen
Mar 31 10:31:40 <lufimtse>	oh,
Mar 31 10:31:57 <lufimtse>	some selection / focus event issue
Mar 31 10:32:00 <lufimtse>	let me checks
Mar 31 10:32:04 <akurtakov>	selection
Mar 31 10:32:17 <akurtakov>	as it's written in the bug
Mar 31 10:34:00 <lufimtse>	I see
Mar 31 10:34:10 <lufimtse>	ok, it differs on gtk2/gtk3
Mar 31 10:34:15 <akurtakov>	yup
Mar 31 10:34:22 <lufimtse>	selection event post double click is lost. Let me bisect this business.
Mar 31 10:36:26 <lufimtse>	Side note. On my local build script, I wrote it so it prints the number of warnings on gtk3. (25 at the moment). This way I catch out if there are more warnings by recent swt patches. Ideally it would be good not to have any warnings, but this will have to do I guess.
Mar 31 10:37:11 <lufimtse>	iehttp://storage1.static.itmages.com/i/17/0331/h_1490971027_8314281_e847953fb9.png
Mar 31 10:37:15 <lufimtse>	http://storage1.static.itmages.com/i/17/0331/h_1490971027_8314281_e847953fb9.png
Mar 31 10:37:50 <lufimtse>	Well, 27 in the patch I checked out atm. (was fixed later).
Mar 31 10:39:37 <lufimtse>	New intern should maybe implement bisect in jdt ui X-D
Mar 31 10:39:41 <lufimtse>	he he
Mar 31 10:46:03 <lufimtse>	---------------
Mar 31 10:46:04 <lufimtse>	anyhows
Mar 31 10:46:10 <lufimtse>	your intuition is right once again.
Mar 31 10:46:12 <lufimtse>	Bug 503431 - [wayland] Mouse button release event not triggering from gdk_event_get() causing DND timeout
Mar 31 10:46:15 <lufimtse>	caused the issue.
Mar 31 10:46:34 <lufimtse>	I'll bug Ian when he comes in, we'll look into a fix for this business.
Mar 31 10:47:39 <akurtakov>	heh,
Mar 31 10:48:04 <akurtakov>	he should be in the office :)
Mar 31 10:59:02 <akurtakov>	WOS
Mar 31 10:59:06 <akurtakov>	wow
Mar 31 10:59:10 <akurtakov>	running
Mar 31 10:59:12 <akurtakov>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=267508
Mar 31 10:59:25 <akurtakov>	I'm amused by the amount of critical warnings on the console
Mar 31 11:01:46 <akurtakov>	and there is a second small shell visible
Mar 31 11:05:45 <lufimtse>	hey
Mar 31 11:05:53 <lufimtse>	Me/Ian discussed the issue.
Mar 31 11:05:57 <lufimtse>	^_^
Mar 31 11:06:03 <lufimtse>	yah, get's rough.
Mar 31 11:06:21 <lufimtse>	but the issue pops up without listeners also
Mar 31 11:06:31 <lufimtse>	and the Text can be substituted for Label or any control really
Mar 31 11:06:59 <lufimtse>	tabItem.setControl() works for the item, but doesn't seem to work that well for the item's children.
Mar 31 11:12:38 <akurtakov>	btw, you should teach me how to use bisect
Mar 31 11:12:49 <akurtakov>	small write up would work
Mar 31 11:12:53 <lufimtse>	sure. 
Mar 31 11:18:24 <akurtakov>	hmm could it be done properly with gtk_container_remove/add
Mar 31 11:19:14 <akurtakov>	btw, another thing to check
Mar 31 11:19:21 <akurtakov>	swt_fixed_add/remove
Mar 31 11:19:28 <akurtakov>	could it be this implementation breaks things
Mar 31 11:20:02 <akurtakov>	anyway, leaving now
Mar 31 11:20:05 <akurtakov>	tty on monday
Mar 31 11:20:31 <lufimtse>	hey
Mar 31 11:20:41 <lufimtse>	I emailed you git bisect mini tutorial
Mar 31 11:21:17 <lufimtse>	I've tried gtk_container_add/remove with increasing ref count, but doesn't change it.
Mar 31 11:21:28 <lufimtse>	swt_fixed_add/remove is a good suggestion, let me investigate.
Mar 31 11:21:37 <akurtakov>	now I really have to run :)
Mar 31 11:21:41 <lufimtse>	X-D
Mar 31 11:21:46 <lufimtse>	HAVE A NICE WEEKEND :-D!
Mar 31 11:22:14 <akurtakov>	you too

Apr 03 10:19:21 <akurtakov>	hey
Apr 03 10:19:25 <akurtakov>	saw your email
Apr 03 10:19:26 <lufimtse>	morning
Apr 03 10:19:33 <akurtakov>	please stay focused on it
Apr 03 10:19:37 <akurtakov>	it's really important bug
Apr 03 10:19:37 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 03 10:20:00 <lufimtse>	yea, it might be causing crashes,
Apr 03 11:13:06 *	Disconnected (Connection timed out)
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-117-87.ams2.redhat.com]
Apr 04 10:44:09 <akurtakov>	should https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=514509 be resolved ?
Apr 04 10:47:28 <lufimtse>	ehy
Apr 04 10:47:35 <lufimtse>	still one more comming in.
Apr 04 10:48:11 <lufimtse>	I'm gluing together my main bindings rebuild script, so that it's easier to debug the "os_custom.c" bits.
Apr 04 10:48:20 <akurtakov>	ah ok
Apr 04 10:48:50 <lufimtse>	at the moment some hackery is involved. I'm making it a 1-script run proccedure. 
Apr 04 10:49:10 <akurtakov>	ah ok
Apr 04 10:49:13 <lufimtse>	I bumped into swt-custom debugging for the tabfolder business
Apr 04 10:49:21 <lufimtse>	and got annoyed about having to re-figure it out each time.
Apr 04 10:49:41 <akurtakov>	ok :)
Apr 04 10:49:52 <akurtakov>	please work with ian on the dnd stuff
Apr 04 10:49:56 <akurtakov>	we have to figure this out
Apr 04 10:49:58 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 04 10:50:18 <akurtakov>	see my comment on #eclipse
Apr 04 11:05:12 <lufimtse>	btw, that SWT_FATAL_WARNINGS came in handy :-)
Apr 04 11:05:52 <lufimtse>	after all that time..
Apr 04 11:09:10 <akurtakov>	what did you catch
Apr 04 11:09:32 <lufimtse>	the tabfolder re-parenting business
Apr 04 11:10:22 <lufimtse>	btw, by dnd importance, you mean help Ian with what he's doing, or like stop the tabfolder fix and work on DnD?
Apr 04 11:10:41 <akurtakov>	the later
Apr 04 11:10:50 <akurtakov>	we should get this dnd asap
Apr 04 11:10:54 <lufimtse>	ok,
Apr 04 11:11:06 <lufimtse>	what you mean with me preping java revert. You mean of Ian's patch?
Apr 04 11:11:17 <akurtakov>	of both ian's patches
Apr 04 11:11:22 <lufimtse>	ok.
Apr 04 11:11:31 <lufimtse>	I'm switching to DnD mode.
Apr 04 11:11:37 <akurtakov>	[18:02] <ipun> i cant actually revert any of this as I am not a committer stil
Apr 04 11:11:38 <akurtakov>	[18:02] <ipun> do i just let Leo know?
Apr 04 11:11:39 <akurtakov>	[18:02] <akurtakov> revert locally
Apr 04 11:11:41 <akurtakov>	[18:03] <akurtakov> and without the native parts and submit as new commit
Apr 04 11:11:42 <akurtakov>	[18:05] <ipun> should i just start with styledtext first, then do https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=503431
Apr 04 11:11:44 <akurtakov>	[18:05] <ipun> this one might take a bit longer
Apr 04 11:12:17 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 04 11:28:27 <lufimtse>	Thanks for staying on top of these things. Without your coordination there'd be chaos X-D
Apr 04 11:28:46 <akurtakov>	haha, that's what I'm paid for :)
Apr 04 11:28:54 <akurtakov>	bring order in the chaos :)
Apr 04 11:29:00 <lufimtse>	X-D
Apr 04 11:31:39 <akurtakov>	let me know when you have the revert in gerrit so I review it before pushing 
Apr 04 11:34:43 <lufimtse>	ok.
Apr 04 11:36:00 <lufimtse>	I'm going through the list: Bug 503431 – [wayland] Mouse button release event not triggering from gdk_event_get() causing DND timeout 
Apr 04 11:36:00 <lufimtse>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=503431
Apr 04 11:44:29 <lufimtse>	btw,
Apr 04 11:44:29 *	akurtakov :No such nick/channel
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-116-150.ams2.redhat.com]
Apr 04 12:30:33 <akurtakov>	is this bug convincing you that we shouldn't go full steam with new changes like you insisted to use gestures everywhere ?
Apr 04 12:31:17 <lufimtse>	quite the opposite :-). If we'd have done a full change, we'd have a bigger user base and these things would be reported quicker than than only by users using 3.14+
Apr 04 12:31:27 <lufimtse>	X-D
Apr 04 12:31:32 <lufimtse>	but I see what you mean.
Apr 04 12:32:21 <akurtakov>	haha - optimist :)
Apr 04 12:32:39 <akurtakov>	what about the fix for them ?
Apr 04 12:33:03 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 04 12:33:10 <lufimtse>	you mean if something breaks on older gtk versions?
Apr 04 12:33:13 <lufimtse>	but works on newer?
Apr 04 12:33:15 <akurtakov>	yeah
Apr 04 12:33:33 <lufimtse>	In my experience dnd is quite consistent across gtk versions,
Apr 04 12:33:37 <lufimtse>	it's the colouring that went funny
Apr 04 12:33:43 <lufimtse>	but I could be wrong,
Apr 04 12:33:56 <akurtakov>	what coloring 
Apr 04 12:34:00 <lufimtse>	css etc..
Apr 04 12:34:17 <lufimtse>	I mean gtk3 had a lot of colour related changes
Apr 04 12:34:25 <lufimtse>	but I haven't seen many changes that impact dnd
Apr 04 12:34:40 <lufimtse>	so I would expect it to be reasonably consistent across 3.*
Apr 04 12:34:48 <lufimtse>	but this is only for DnD
Apr 04 12:34:52 <lufimtse>	not for any kind of patch.
Apr 04 12:34:53 <akurtakov>	well for starter there is no gesture on gtk2
Apr 04 12:35:00 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 04 12:35:31 <lufimtse>	well, we only use the guesture for the off-set,
Apr 04 12:35:43 <lufimtse>	but Idk :-)
Apr 04 12:36:02 <lufimtse>	My brain isn't big enough to handle all those if gtk3.14 branch conditions
Apr 04 12:36:08 <lufimtse>	just one logic X-D
Apr 04 12:36:13 <akurtakov>	sure
Apr 04 12:36:25 <akurtakov>	I would love to have the freedom to support gtk3.22 only :)
Apr 04 12:36:34 <lufimtse>	hkk
Apr 04 12:36:35 <lufimtse>	hmm
Apr 04 12:36:38 <lufimtse>	that'd be sweat.
Apr 04 12:36:52 <lufimtse>	at the moment Ian's writing a patch that seems promising
Apr 04 12:37:03 <akurtakov>	yeah, I tested it briefly
Apr 04 12:37:08 <akurtakov>	looks good on x11
Apr 04 12:38:06 <lufimtse>	works pretty well for me
Apr 04 12:38:13 <lufimtse>	Staging view, dnd snippet
Apr 04 12:38:16 <lufimtse>	launch config business
Apr 04 12:38:31 <lufimtse>	maybe keep Ian's DnD patches and submit his new patch?
Apr 04 12:38:37 <akurtakov>	yeah
Apr 04 12:38:41 <lufimtse>	Ian's pretty quick with fixing up reported glitches.
Apr 04 12:38:57 <lufimtse>	And his work on changing DnD architecture was badly needed
Apr 04 12:39:02 <lufimtse>	it was not a trivial task
Apr 04 12:39:13 <akurtakov>	oh sure it isn't 
Apr 04 12:39:23 <lufimtse>	but with changing of the architecture, comes bugs
Apr 04 12:39:29 <lufimtse>	it was a needed tradeoff
Apr 04 12:39:42 <akurtakov>	dinner time, will join later
Apr 04 12:39:43 <lufimtse>	maybe explain to folks submitting the bug reports about the architecture change
Apr 04 12:39:47 <lufimtse>	ok. ^?
Apr 04 12:39:56 <lufimtse>	I could post and explain architecture changes?
Apr 04 12:40:02 <lufimtse>	so users would understand..
Apr 04 12:40:11 <akurtakov>	they will not :)

[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-117-207.ams2.redhat.com]
Apr 05 10:24:04 <akurtakov>	hey Leo 
Apr 05 10:24:12 <akurtakov>	what's up?
Apr 05 10:24:32 <lufimtse>	morning.
Apr 05 10:24:42 <akurtakov>	would you please try adding new function in WebKitGTK
Apr 05 10:24:56 <akurtakov>	and see whether webkitgtk.c is regenerated
Apr 05 10:25:10 <akurtakov>	for me only the *_stats.c/h are regenerated
Apr 05 10:25:19 <lufimtse>	Let me check.
Apr 05 10:25:26 <lufimtse>	which eclipse build are you on?
Apr 05 10:25:40 <akurtakov>	always lated Build id: I20170405-0300
Apr 05 10:25:43 <akurtakov>	I update every day
Apr 05 10:25:47 <lufimtse>	:-)
Apr 05 10:26:07 <akurtakov>	esp. when I see smth breaking first thing I do is update
Apr 05 10:27:58 <lufimtse>	I see
Apr 05 10:28:07 <lufimtse>	works for me. My eclipse is 4 days old.
Apr 05 10:28:11 <lufimtse>	Let me update my eclipse.
Apr 05 10:28:16 <lufimtse>	and check again.
Apr 05 10:28:47 <akurtakov>	well, another option is to be F26 to which Iupdated  today
Apr 05 10:29:03 <lufimtse>	:-)
Apr 05 10:29:20 <akurtakov>	but this doesn't make sense from first thought
Apr 05 10:29:44 <lufimtse>	F26 is scary
Apr 05 10:29:48 <akurtakov>	why ?
Apr 05 10:29:56 <lufimtse>	stuff tends to break for alpha builds.
Apr 05 10:30:06 <lufimtse>	once I updated, my machine was freezing every 10 minutes
Apr 05 10:30:27 <lufimtse>	had to fiddle with various kernels to get things working again
Apr 05 10:30:29 <lufimtse>	X-
Apr 05 10:30:31 <akurtakov>	yeah but if smth breaks with alpha you have to push for the change for beta or it becomes too late
Apr 05 10:30:36 <akurtakov>	are you on F26 now ?
Apr 05 10:30:45 <lufimtse>	F25
Apr 05 10:30:51 <lufimtse>	you think I sohuld update?
Apr 05 10:30:55 <akurtakov>	no
Apr 05 10:31:03 <akurtakov>	one of us suffering with alpha is enough :)
Apr 05 10:31:08 <lufimtse>	X-D
Apr 05 10:31:17 <lufimtse>	../eclipse update in progress.
Apr 05 10:31:27 <lufimtse>	did it break after updating to F26?
Apr 05 10:31:39 <akurtakov>	well, I noticed it after the update
Apr 05 10:31:55 <akurtakov>	but haven't needed swttools regeneration in more than a week 
Apr 05 10:32:03 <akurtakov>	so not sure
Apr 05 10:32:55 <lufimtse>	my trouble is that shellED tends to cause my eclipse to hang
Apr 05 10:33:03 <lufimtse>	so I've not been using it because of that.
Apr 05 10:33:06 <lufimtse>	but wish I could..
Apr 05 10:33:12 <akurtakov>	hmm, 
Apr 05 10:33:18 <akurtakov>	I haven't seen bug report :)
Apr 05 10:33:28 <lufimtse>	maybeh I should file one
Apr 05 10:33:34 <lufimtse>	see if it occurs on gtk2....
Apr 05 10:33:46 <akurtakov>	I can assure you I don't know of bugs that are not reported :)
Apr 05 10:33:53 <lufimtse>	X-D
Apr 05 10:34:13 <lufimtse>	Do you know how to get a stacktrace of a jvm that hung?
Apr 05 10:34:44 <akurtakov>	jstack ?
Apr 05 10:37:11 <lufimtse>	I see I can do it for a child eclipse
Apr 05 10:37:17 <lufimtse>	by right clicking on stack
Apr 05 10:37:25 <lufimtse>	kinda curious if I can do it for my main eclipse
Apr 05 10:37:32 <lufimtse>	I guess not since it doesn't run in debug ?
Apr 05 10:37:37 <akurtakov>	http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/share/jstack.html
Apr 05 10:38:44 <lufimtse>	oooeeee
Apr 05 10:38:51 <lufimtse>	Thank you.
Apr 05 10:38:57 <lufimtse>	This is what I've been looking for.
Apr 05 10:39:00 <lufimtse>	Life is better now.
Apr 05 10:39:20 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 05 10:39:42 <akurtakov>	most probably it is a bug in the parser ending cycling
Apr 05 10:41:09 <lufimtse>	hmm
Apr 05 10:41:11 <lufimtse>	probably
Apr 05 10:41:26 <lufimtse>	Anyone maintaining shellEd these days?
Apr 05 10:41:30 <lufimtse>	you know?
Apr 05 10:41:33 <lufimtse>	you still work on it?
Apr 05 10:41:37 <akurtakov>	if it happens with one single file I'll need it too
Apr 05 10:41:52 <akurtakov>	I'm the only one doing any shelled/ruby dltk work nowadasy
Apr 05 10:42:03 <lufimtse>	I see.
Apr 05 10:42:39 <lufimtse>	ok, so webkitgtk.c is being generated.
Apr 05 10:42:50 <akurtakov>	sigh so smth on f26 broke it
Apr 05 10:42:56 <akurtakov>	wondering what it could be
Apr 05 10:43:01 <lufimtse>	hmmmm
Apr 05 10:43:20 <lufimtse>	let me think about it for a sec...
Apr 05 10:43:34 <lufimtse>	I suppose you did a project clean?
Apr 05 10:43:42 <akurtakov>	oh yeah multiple times
Apr 05 10:43:58 <lufimtse>	I used this function:
Apr 05 10:43:59 <lufimtse>	public static final native boolean _webkit_web_view_is_editable (long /*int*/ web_view);
Apr 05 10:43:59 <lufimtse>	public static final boolean webkit_web_view_is_editable (long /*int*/ web_view) {
Apr 05 10:43:59 <lufimtse>		lock.lock();
Apr 05 10:43:59 <lufimtse>		try {
Apr 05 10:43:59 <lufimtse>			return _webkit_web_view_is_editable (web_view);
Apr 05 10:43:59 <lufimtse>		} finally {
Apr 05 10:43:59 <lufimtse>			lock.unlock();
Apr 05 10:43:59 <lufimtse>		}
Apr 05 10:43:59 <lufimtse>	}
Apr 05 10:44:14 <lufimtse>	ah yea

Apr 06 09:59:17 <lufimtse>	morning
Apr 06 09:59:21 <akurtakov>	hey
Apr 06 09:59:28 <lufimtse>	looks like lots of broken tests this morning
Apr 06 09:59:32 <lufimtse>	http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/I20170405-2000/testResults.php
Apr 06 09:59:34 <lufimtse>	not in swt, 
Apr 06 09:59:39 <lufimtse>	but other projects seem to have more than usual
Apr 06 09:59:48 <akurtakov>	issue is found I think
Apr 06 10:00:11 <akurtakov>	http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.resources.git/commit/?id=607937d3eeafb995b5d9711e21683dc4934e0a96
Apr 06 10:00:52 <lufimtse>	I see
Apr 06 10:01:14 <lufimtse>	I looked into the dnd business with Ian.
Apr 06 10:01:36 <lufimtse>	We may have to find something that doesn't involve modifying styled text
Apr 06 10:01:49 <akurtakov>	I fully agree on this one 
Apr 06 10:02:08 <lufimtse>	reason is that there are other custom widgets..
Apr 06 10:02:12 <lufimtse>	that are outside swt
Apr 06 10:02:18 <akurtakov>	yeah
Apr 06 10:02:33 <akurtakov>	I have explained that to Ian weeks ago already
Apr 06 10:03:30 <lufimtse>	so far it seems that we could get away with using a context_iteration in mouseDown, simmilar to how evaluate() waits in Browser.
Apr 06 10:03:50 <lufimtse>	A little hacky, but may be neccessary for cocoa/win32 compatability
Apr 06 10:04:03 <akurtakov>	as long as it works
Apr 06 10:04:07 <lufimtse>	ok.
Apr 06 11:14:41 <lufimtse>	I explained to Ian how to read crash logs and how to translate "Java org_eclipse_swt_internal_gtk_OS GDK_1EVENT_1TYPE" to OS.java:GDK_EVENT_TYPE etc..
Apr 06 11:14:50 <lufimtse>	he found what causes the crash, working on fix.
Apr 06 11:19:36 <lufimtse>	btw, I want to carefully review every new DnD path, so that I'm aware what's going on. Would it be ok if I do the final merge on all upcomming DnD patches? (You are still also welcome to review them when Ian asks)
Apr 06 11:19:54 <lufimtse>	just so I know the state of DnD when Ian leaves.
Apr 06 11:20:10 <lufimtse>	I'll quizz Ian on every patch, so I understand it.
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-117-66.ams2.redhat.com]
Apr 06 11:23:11 <akurtakov>	sure
Apr 06 11:23:15 <akurtakov>	do them
Apr 06 11:23:36 <akurtakov>	it is just fine for me as I can't keep track of everything deeply
Apr 06 11:24:14 <lufimtse>	btw
Apr 06 11:24:14 <lufimtse>	News:
Apr 06 11:24:14 <lufimtse>	Ubuntu 18.04 LTS To Drop Default Unity Desktop, Will Switch Back To GNOME  (April 5th)

Apr 06 11:24:27 <lufimtse>	oh my.
Apr 06 11:24:29 <akurtakov>	finally

Apr 06 11:24:46 <lufimtse>	he he . 
Apr 06 11:25:26 <akurtakov>	gnome shell is the future of desktop computing :)
Apr 06 11:25:33 *	akurtakov does a bold statement
Apr 06 12:13:12 <lufimtse>	Ian is making some change to patch now.
Apr 06 12:13:16 <lufimtse>	If testing, please wait.
Apr 06 12:13:54 <akurtakov>	let's speak in #eclipse 
Apr 06 12:14:02 <akurtakov>	as it's tough who said what to whom
Apr 06 12:14:46 <lufimtse>	how about #SWT ?
Apr 06 12:14:57 <lufimtse>	me/ian/eric hang out there.

Apr 10 12:12:06 <akurtakov>	what happened with your shelled bug ?
Apr 10 12:12:10 <akurtakov>	have you filed one ?
Apr 10 12:12:16 <lufimtse>	hey
Apr 10 12:12:41 *	lufimtse added "Reproduce and file shelled bug"
Apr 10 12:12:47 *	lufimtse to his todo list
Apr 10 12:12:53 <akurtakov>	aha ok :)
Apr 10 12:32:32 <akurtakov>	regarding https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94601/
Apr 10 12:32:37 <lufimtse>	hey
Apr 10 12:32:39 <akurtakov>	I'm missing build -deps
Apr 10 12:32:46 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 10 12:32:52 <akurtakov>	but the script still reports success although it hasn't compiled :)
Apr 10 12:33:07 <akurtakov>	Package dependency requirement 'glib-2.0 >= 2.53.0' could not be satisfied.
Apr 10 12:33:09 <akurtakov>	Package 'glib-2.0' has version '2.52.0', required version is '>= 2.53.0'
Apr 10 12:33:31 <lufimtse>	ah, derp.
Apr 10 12:33:35 <lufimtse>	I see the fault
Apr 10 12:33:50 <lufimtse>	I added two lines, which messed with the error check
Apr 10 12:34:00 <akurtakov>	btw, it's weird that latest gtk322 can't be compiled on fedora 26 :)
Apr 10 12:34:07 <lufimtse>	hmmm

Apr 10 14:14:29 <lufimtse>	after a little bit of research, seems like ui freezes for a minute
Apr 10 14:14:32 <lufimtse>	then unlocks again
Apr 10 14:14:51 <lufimtse>	the stacktrace seems to show swt pango
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-116-21.ams2.redhat.com]
Apr 10 14:15:08 <akurtakov>	meh
Apr 10 14:15:14 <akurtakov>	it doesn't make any sense 
Apr 10 14:15:15 <lufimtse>	I wonder if it just happens to call that method in a loop, or if that call causes the hang
Apr 10 14:15:21 <lufimtse>	I should try gtk2
Apr 10 14:15:28 <akurtakov>	BrowserInformationControl
Apr 10 14:15:37 <lufimtse>	I tried with webkit1, 
Apr 10 14:15:38 <akurtakov>	this is used for tooltips and other things
Apr 10 14:15:39 <lufimtse>	still hangs
Apr 10 14:15:49 <lufimtse>	Maybe
Apr 10 14:15:51 <lufimtse>	lemme check
Apr 10 14:16:03 <lufimtse>	does seem to contain browser
Apr 10 14:16:11 <lufimtse>	not sure if browser is causing hang thou. hmmm
Apr 10 14:16:32 <lufimtse>	Let me see if this business occurs with gtk
Apr 10 14:16:33 <lufimtse>	2
Apr 10 14:17:36 <lufimtse>	... trying...
Apr 10 14:22:33 <akurtakov>	yeah, I'm 99% sure it's the man page tooltip causing it
Apr 10 14:25:21 <lufimtse>	hmm
Apr 10 14:25:24 <lufimtse>	Let me check
Apr 10 14:25:25 <lufimtse>	btw
Apr 10 14:25:29 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94601  <<< ready for review
Apr 10 14:25:32 <lufimtse>	round 2#
Apr 10 14:26:02 <lufimtse>	akurtakov << yes, you are right, the man-page preview seems to cause the hang
Apr 10 14:26:12 <lufimtse>	Occurs on Gtk2 as well
Apr 10 14:26:26 <lufimtse>	when I hover over some symbol for too long...
Apr 10 14:26:28 <lufimtse>	like "exit'
Apr 10 14:27:01 <lufimtse>	It does popup eventually thou.
Apr 10 14:27:06 <lufimtse>	after that one minute
Apr 10 14:27:09 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 10 14:27:31 <lufimtse>	I like shelled, would be nice to have fixed. I'd be happy to investigate?
Apr 10 14:47:29 <akurtakov>	I'll look at it tomorrow
Apr 10 14:47:33 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 10 14:47:34 <akurtakov>	should be fairly trivial fix
Apr 10 15:25:54 <akurtakov>	weird enough it happens only on exit
Apr 10 15:26:09 <akurtakov>	if your script doesn't have exit you will see no issues
Apr 10 15:26:58 <akurtakov>	probably because it's huge man page
Apr 10 15:37:15 <lufimtse>	hmm
Apr 10 15:37:29 <akurtakov>	anyway, it's long standing improvement
Apr 10 15:37:53 <lufimtse>	maybeh,
Apr 10 15:37:56 <akurtakov>	hover provider should try doing 'help exit' before doing 'man exit'
Apr 10 15:38:01 <lufimtse>	happens with 'cd' also
Apr 10 15:38:07 <akurtakov>	and display more appropriate data
Apr 10 15:38:26 <akurtakov>	yeah for cd you see the same man page for bash builtins
Apr 10 15:38:41 <akurtakov>	anyway, will be fixed tomorrow
Apr 10 15:38:50 <akurtakov>	together with better hover help shown :)
Apr 10 15:38:54 <lufimtse>	X-D
Apr 10 15:38:57 <lufimtse>	yay
Apr 10 15:39:12 <akurtakov>	as the man for these commands are kind of useless
Apr 10 15:40:21 <lufimtse>	I have a feeling there's an O(n^2) in there somewhere
Apr 10 15:40:51 <akurtakov>	no, it's overwhelming the browser with almost 1mb of pre 
Apr 10 15:41:30 <akurtakov>	I measured it and the part where the man page is fetched takes 70 ms
Apr 10 15:41:44 <lufimtse>	how u measure it?
Apr 10 15:41:45 <akurtakov>	and it slows down in the browser loading
Apr 10 15:41:49 <akurtakov>	sysout :)
Apr 10 15:41:53 <lufimtse>	ah
Apr 10 15:42:15 <akurtakov>	anyway, will be fixed

Apr 12 08:19:25 <lufimtse>	morning
Apr 12 08:19:40 <akurtakov>	hey, you're early today
Apr 12 08:19:49 <lufimtse>	:-D
Apr 12 08:20:33 <lufimtse>	I tend to do bike training in the morning and then come to work. But I find that I tend to be late (~9:30.../10am). So I want to switch things around and go to work at 7am and do bike training in the evening at 3/4pm.
Apr 12 08:20:49 <lufimtse>	btw, would the newest eclipse have the shelled fix, or would I have to checkout repos with fix?
Apr 12 08:21:01 <akurtakov>	I commented on the bug 
Apr 12 08:21:08 <akurtakov>	just install from the repo I pointed to
Apr 12 08:21:11 <lufimtse>	ah
Apr 12 08:21:23 <lufimtse>	have not checked email yet.
Apr 12 08:22:41 <lufimtse>	I was planning on testing it today, but I didn't think to leave a comment informing that I'd do so. This reminds me of the point you made about making your work public, it's a good reminder to write about what you're going to do. I'll tryna post comments about me testing things in the future.
Apr 12 08:22:56 <lufimtse>	So folks know.
Apr 12 08:22:59 <lufimtse>	Let me test....
Apr 12 08:24:10 <lufimtse>	---
Apr 12 08:24:33 <lufimtse>	btw, what does the sdk do? Like shelled sdk? (i.e compared to checking out the git repo). Do you know?
Apr 12 08:24:50 <akurtakov>	installs the source bundles
Apr 12 08:25:02 <lufimtse>	for debugging?
Apr 12 08:25:08 <akurtakov>	yeah
Apr 12 08:25:24 <lufimtse>	Ah. So it's for stepping/reading code, but not modifying it.
Apr 12 08:25:33 <akurtakov>	exactly
Apr 12 08:26:37 <lufimtse>	Sometimes I need to read java source code, (e.g for collections). I'd like to ctrl+shift+r  (resource) search java classes, (e.g LinkedList) etc... Do you know any good way of doing so? (at the moment I have a separate eclipse with java source code that I use for that).
Apr 12 08:27:36 <akurtakov>	works just fine for me :)
Apr 12 08:27:48 <akurtakov>	do you have java-1.8.0-openjdk-src installed ?
Apr 12 08:28:25 <lufimtse>	yea. I mean I can Open java source code, like if I hover over "LinkedList", it shows me the sources. But I'd like to be able to 'search it'.
Apr 12 08:28:32 <lufimtse>	via ctrl+shift+r
Apr 12 08:28:46 <lufimtse>	haven't found a good way to search the java source code yte
Apr 12 08:28:47 <lufimtse>	yet
Apr 12 08:28:56 <lufimtse>	other than import java sources as a project
Apr 12 08:29:01 <lufimtse>	which makes eclipse sloooww
Apr 12 08:29:04 <akurtakov>	well, ctrl-shift-r works 
Apr 12 08:29:11 <akurtakov>	only for resources in the workspace
Apr 12 08:29:32 <akurtakov>	but if you use ctlr-shift-t you can find and open any java type 
Apr 12 08:30:45 <lufimtse>	ooeeeee
Apr 12 08:31:37 <lufimtse>	Life is better now.
Apr 12 08:31:42 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 12 08:31:49 <lufimtse>	Now I wonder, is there any way to see neighbouring classes?
Apr 12 08:31:53 <lufimtse>	like I can find LinkedList
Apr 12 08:32:07 <lufimtse>	but what about seeing it's neighbouring java classes
Apr 12 08:32:24 <akurtakov>	by neighbouring you mean seeing the package
Apr 12 08:32:25 <akurtakov>	?
Apr 12 08:32:30 <lufimtse>	yea
Apr 12 08:32:34 <lufimtse>	like in package explorer
Apr 12 08:32:42 <akurtakov>	in the package explorer toolbar
Apr 12 08:32:54 <akurtakov>	there is icon with arrows pointing in opposite directions
Apr 12 08:33:00 <akurtakov>	press it :)
Apr 12 08:33:07 <akurtakov>	link with editor
Apr 12 08:33:25 <akurtakov>	and when you open some editor package explorer will navigate to it :)
Apr 12 08:34:45 <lufimtse>	doesn't seem to work for java source X-|.  Try ctrl+shift+t -> Consumer.class
Apr 12 08:35:04 <akurtakov>	works for me :)
Apr 12 08:35:07 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 12 08:35:13 <lufimtse>	lemme check if I have src installed properly
Apr 12 08:35:37 <akurtakov>	https://imagebin.ca/v/3Ioe0tUq7X2p
Apr 12 08:35:51 <akurtakov>	this is how it looks for me after opening Consumer
Apr 12 08:35:57 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 12 08:35:59 <lufimtse>	I see
Apr 12 08:36:07 <akurtakov>	are you on latest I-build ?
Apr 12 08:36:13 <lufimtse>	like a week ago
Apr 12 08:36:28 <akurtakov>	some of the dnd patches were breaking synchronization
Apr 12 08:36:29 <lufimtse>	do you have any filters enabled?
Apr 12 08:36:41 <akurtakov>	only for closed projects
Apr 12 08:36:52 <lufimtse>	I'm on wayland...
Apr 12 08:36:59 <lufimtse>	might be wayland specific,
Apr 12 08:37:02 <lufimtse>	I should try x11
Apr 12 08:37:23 <akurtakov>	I'm waiting for your review of Ian's patch and I'll be back on wayland
Apr 12 08:37:36 <lufimtse>	btw, shelled no longer hangs. But pops don't show up either. (might be wayland specific thou..)
Apr 12 08:37:47 <lufimtse>	I'm fixing things up a little on the patch
Apr 12 08:37:55 <lufimtse>	there's a subtle thing to fix there.
Apr 12 08:37:57 <akurtakov>	no popups at all?
Apr 12 08:38:07 <lufimtse>	nope. But i'm on wayland as of yesterday
Apr 12 08:38:10 <lufimtse>	need to test on x11
Apr 12 08:38:21 <lufimtse>	sec
Apr 12 08:45:59 <lufimtse>	Ok, so I found that the following filter has to be turned off: "External Plug-in libraries module"
Apr 12 08:46:10 <lufimtse>	then Packages are shown
Apr 12 08:46:15 <lufimtse>	for Consumer (ctrl+shift+t)
Apr 12 08:46:23 <lufimtse>	works on wayland also
Apr 12 08:46:57 <lufimtse>	ok. Life is *much* better now.
Apr 12 08:48:44 <akurtakov>	what about the shell script 
Apr 12 08:48:52 <akurtakov>	nohover help ?
Apr 12 08:49:24 <lufimtse>	sec.
Apr 12 08:53:07 <lufimtse>	No popups with Eclipse on x11 with Wayland desktop. Let me try logging into X11. Be right back.

Apr 12 09:28:02 <lufimtse>	but after updating shelled from the repo, all sorts of breakages occured
Apr 12 09:28:06 <akurtakov>	which would be mine again :)
Apr 12 09:28:10 <lufimtse>	so we have:
Apr 12 09:28:14 <lufimtse>	1) no popups
Apr 12 09:28:16 <lufimtse>	2) no outline
Apr 12 09:28:20 <lufimtse>	3) no content assist
Apr 12 09:28:44 <lufimtse>	I could checkout sources and inspect induvidual commits?
Apr 12 09:29:09 <lufimtse>	like to see if it was actually the recent patch, or other patches.
Apr 12 09:29:25 <akurtakov>	did you update only shelled or dltk.core too?
Apr 12 09:29:34 <lufimtse>	shelled
Apr 12 09:29:37 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 12 09:29:38 <lufimtse>	I seee
Apr 12 09:29:48 <lufimtse>	maybe I need to update core also
Apr 12 09:30:38 <lufimtse>	actually...
Apr 12 09:30:39 <lufimtse>	sec
Apr 12 09:31:31 <lufimtse>	I don't have core installed I think?
Apr 12 09:31:45 <lufimtse>	Is it "Dynamic Languages Tooltit - Core Frameworks" ?
Apr 12 09:31:51 <lufimtse>	I only selected shelled
Apr 12 09:32:12 <akurtakov>	yeah
Apr 12 09:32:15 <lufimtse>	I only have dltk shelled and mylyn
Apr 12 09:32:15 <akurtakov>	it's a dep
Apr 12 09:32:29 <akurtakov>	anyway, I'll figure it out
Apr 12 09:32:41 <lufimtse>	I see
Apr 12 09:32:45 <lufimtse>	my core frameworks is old
Apr 12 09:32:48 <lufimtse>	let me update.
Apr 12 09:33:05 <lufimtse>	ah no, it's up to date.
Apr 12 09:33:09 <lufimtse>	same version as shelled
Apr 12 09:34:17 <lufimtse>	btw, is the core H2 index relevant? (and core Lucene?)
Apr 12 09:34:47 <akurtakov>	relevant for what
Apr 12 09:34:51 <lufimtse>	shelled
Apr 12 09:34:55 <akurtakov>	no
Apr 12 09:34:56 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 12 09:47:14 <akurtakov>	I see now
Apr 12 09:47:23 <akurtakov>	for some reason when installed form p2 update site
Apr 12 09:47:25 <akurtakov>	it's broken
Apr 12 09:47:33 <akurtakov>	when used in child eclipse works just fine
Apr 12 09:47:34 <akurtakov>	wtf
Apr 12 09:48:29 <lufimtse>	bleh
Apr 12 09:48:46 <lufimtse>	I wonder if Roland would know about why
Apr 12 09:53:09 <akurtakov>	would you please try instlaling master on neon for the sake of checking 
Apr 12 09:53:28 <lufimtse>	erm
Apr 12 09:53:42 <lufimtse>	so you mean download neon
Apr 12 09:53:48 <lufimtse>	update shelled?
Apr 12 09:53:51 <lufimtse>	from repo?
Apr 12 09:53:54 <akurtakov>	nevermind
Apr 12 09:54:00 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 12 10:01:44 <akurtakov>	so just tried it on neon
Apr 12 10:01:47 <akurtakov>	and it works
Apr 12 10:02:10 <akurtakov>	wtf
Apr 12 10:04:08 <lufimtse>	merps
Apr 12 10:08:59 <lufimtse>	btw. Not shelled related: I emailed you about "manual junit"
Apr 12 10:09:04 <lufimtse>	when you have the time ... :-)/
Apr 12 10:09:19 <lufimtse>	Thsi is for dnd and architecture patches.
Apr 12 10:46:50 <lufimtse>	btw, about the hybrid jUnit business. Mind if I postpone the DnD fix for a day for me to first get the jUnits out of the door? I want to establish a culture of jUnit first, then patch as oppose to patch and jUnit never happening.
Apr 12 10:47:23 <akurtakov>	this means I'll have it Wed morning ?
Apr 12 10:47:31 <akurtakov>	if you promise that - yes
Apr 12 10:47:37 <lufimtse>	today is wednesday
Apr 12 10:47:38 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 12 10:47:45 <akurtakov>	next wed
Apr 12 10:47:47 <akurtakov>	I mean
Apr 12 10:47:58 <akurtakov>	as if you postpone today
Apr 12 10:48:04 <akurtakov>	fri/mon are holidays
Apr 12 10:48:09 <akurtakov>	so you'll put it on tue
Apr 12 10:48:11 <lufimtse>	by wednesday guaranteed
Apr 12 10:48:13 <akurtakov>	next week
Apr 12 10:48:25 <lufimtse>	./assuming I don't find breakage in the patch
Apr 12 10:48:33 <lufimtse>	ok. 
Apr 12 10:48:42 <akurtakov>	well, I hope you assume correct
Apr 12 10:48:51 <akurtakov>	note that we are really close to end of devel
Apr 12 10:49:06 <lufimtse>	may 4th?
Apr 12 10:49:27 <akurtakov>	yeah
Apr 12 10:49:31 <lufimtse>	ok.

[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@10.36.116.255]
Apr 12 11:43:30 <akurtakov>	hey
Apr 12 12:05:49 <lufimtse>	hello
Apr 12 12:06:24 <lufimtse>	sup
Apr 12 12:15:51 <akurtakov>	regarding shelled
Apr 12 12:16:00 <lufimtse>	yea
Apr 12 12:16:03 <akurtakov>	would you plese install smth else (whatever)
Apr 12 12:16:12 <lufimtse>	from dltk?
Apr 12 12:16:19 <akurtakov>	and start on a new workspace to check
Apr 12 12:16:21 <akurtakov>	doesn't matter
Apr 12 12:16:31 <akurtakov>	I just want to trigger the reconciler
Apr 12 12:16:57 <lufimtse>	I'm a bit puzzled. You mean install some dtlk package, open new workspace and then ...?
Apr 12 12:17:16 <lufimtse>	i.e, what steps to follow and what results to expect after?
Apr 12 12:17:16 <akurtakov>	open shell file in the new workspace
Apr 12 12:17:34 <lufimtse>	by install something else, can you clarify?
Apr 12 12:17:36 <akurtakov>	and see whether hover/outline/autocomplete works
Apr 12 12:17:48 <lufimtse>	you mean a dltk package or eclipse spin?
Apr 12 12:17:57 <akurtakov>	whatever you pick e.g. libhover
Apr 12 12:18:46 <lufimtse>	I'm off to lunch, (friend is waiting), let me investigate when I come back if that's ok.
Apr 12 12:18:54 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 12 13:21:03 <akurtakov>	let me know when you're back
Apr 12 13:43:05 <lufimtse>	back
Apr 12 13:43:19 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 12 13:43:19 <lufimtse>	so
Apr 12 13:43:31 <lufimtse>	I'm don't quite understand exact steps,
Apr 12 13:43:34 <akurtakov>	what type of project is your sh file in ?
Apr 12 13:43:39 <lufimtse>	in swt
Apr 12 13:43:53 <lufimtse>	java
Apr 12 13:44:20 <lufimtse>	but outline worked in swt's java project before
Apr 12 13:44:25 <lufimtse>	and context etc...
Apr 12 13:44:27 <akurtakov>	can you try creating new plain project
Apr 12 13:44:33 <akurtakov>	and see whether it works there
Apr 12 13:44:36 <lufimtse>	ok, sec.
Apr 12 13:45:00 <lufimtse>	like plain plain or new java project?
Apr 12 13:45:10 <akurtakov>	plain plain :)
Apr 12 13:45:18 <akurtakov>	and also try with shell script project
Apr 12 13:45:26 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 12 13:47:10 <lufimtse>	works in shell script project
Apr 12 13:47:19 <lufimtse>	btw, I didn't know shell script project exist 
Apr 12 13:47:21 <lufimtse>	interesting
Apr 12 13:47:27 <lufimtse>	can run scripts and print to terminal
Apr 12 13:47:28 <lufimtse>	useful
Apr 12 13:47:42 <akurtakov>	right click on swt.tools project
Apr 12 13:47:51 <akurtakov>	select configure menu
Apr 12 13:48:12 <akurtakov>	Add shell script support
Apr 12 13:48:18 <akurtakov>	and reopen the editor
Apr 12 13:48:34 <akurtakov>	tbh I don't know how it worked without that and after debugging it for few hours :)
Apr 12 13:49:05 <lufimtse>	now works
Apr 12 13:49:07 <lufimtse>	interestin
Apr 12 13:49:20 <lufimtse>	odd to have it in configure thou
Apr 12 13:49:31 <lufimtse>	for c++, it's in new -> add c/c++ nature
Apr 12 13:49:58 <lufimtse>	ok, I think I should commit the .project changes to swt tools
Apr 12 13:50:04 <akurtakov>	feel free to do it :)
Apr 12 13:50:19 <akurtakov>	actually I'm quite surprised it used to work without it
Apr 12 13:50:47 <akurtakov>	now tell me what you think of the new hover help 
Apr 12 13:51:02 <lufimtse>	lemme see
Apr 12 13:52:11 <lufimtse>	Me like. The only thing it's kinda small.
Apr 12 13:52:16 <lufimtse>	and doesn't remember if I make it bigger
Apr 12 13:52:30 <lufimtse>	It'd be nice to have a static view also.
Apr 12 13:52:34 <lufimtse>	like javadoc view.
Apr 12 13:52:45 <lufimtse>	any chance to make that popup somewhat bigger?
Apr 12 13:53:47 <akurtakov>	yeah, but it uses the standard dltk component which is hack similar to jdt one
Apr 12 13:53:54 <akurtakov>	would take more time 
Apr 12 13:54:30 <lufimtse>	I wonder if size could be made at least a bit wider
Apr 12 13:54:39 <lufimtse>	http://imgur.com/a/6rmAU
Apr 12 13:54:49 <lufimtse>	like 80 chars don't fit
Apr 12 13:54:53 <akurtakov>	when on command (note shouldn't be shell builtin) hit Alt+M
Apr 12 13:55:50 <lufimtse>	doesn't seem to do anything?
Apr 12 13:56:36 <akurtakov>	let me see maybe got broken over time
Apr 12 13:56:47 <lufimtse>	What is it suppose to do?
Apr 12 13:57:24 <akurtakov>	open man page in separate view :)
Apr 12 13:58:13 <akurtakov>	ah sorry
Apr 12 13:58:24 <akurtakov>	it works on selection 
Apr 12 13:58:39 <akurtakov>	e.g. select git command and hit Ctrl+M
Apr 12 13:58:44 <akurtakov>	err Alt+M
Apr 12 13:59:06 <lufimtse>	oh
Apr 12 13:59:07 <lufimtse>	that works
Apr 12 13:59:08 <lufimtse>	yay
Apr 12 13:59:09 <akurtakov>	it makes sense to make it take the current word
Apr 12 13:59:21 <lufimtse>	life is good.
Apr 12 13:59:33 <akurtakov>	open help
Apr 12 13:59:53 <akurtakov>	there are the man pages indexed there
Apr 12 14:00:43 <akurtakov>	if you have Man page viewer installed from Oxygen p2 site
Apr 12 14:00:44 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 12 14:02:08 <lufimtse>	man page viewer...
Apr 12 14:02:08 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Apr 12 14:02:14 <lufimtse>	lemme investigate
Apr 12 14:03:29 <akurtakov>	that one is Mat's creation
Apr 12 14:03:45 <akurtakov>	all the rest - shell script, man page parsing, rendering is mine :)
Apr 12 14:07:49 <lufimtse>	ah, man page viewer basically adds man pages to eclipse's help
Apr 12 14:08:16 <akurtakov>	exactly
Apr 12 14:08:50 <akurtakov>	so if you have Help view open
Apr 12 14:08:55 <akurtakov>	and search for git 
Apr 12 14:09:03 <akurtakov>	you will find git man page there
Apr 12 14:09:17 <akurtakov>	note that they are indexed via lucene so search is instant
Apr 12 14:09:48 <akurtakov>	it's these small things that make eclipse so much better
Apr 12 14:15:36 <akurtakov>	8 years later https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94948/1/plugins/org.eclipse.dltk.sh.ui/src/org/eclipse/dltk/sh/internal/ui/commands/ShowManHandler.java :)
Apr 12 14:15:53 <akurtakov>	and you start to notice how few you knew back then :)
Apr 12 14:16:08 <lufimtse>	I like
Apr 12 14:17:12 <akurtakov>	so do you find more and more of eclipse power :)
Apr 12 14:20:59 <lufimtse>	true
Apr 12 14:21:05 <lufimtse>	I like the search
Apr 12 14:21:05 <lufimtse>	neat
Apr 12 14:21:09 <lufimtse>	can bookmark stuff.
Apr 12 14:21:16 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 12 14:21:18 <lufimtse>	ok, now gotta fix up that dnd patch X-D
Apr 12 14:21:46 <akurtakov>	yeah, whenever you think of some functionality you miss
Apr 12 14:21:49 <akurtakov>	please let me know
Apr 12 14:21:56 <akurtakov>	either we have it or we can add it :)
Apr 12 14:25:49 <lufimtse>	ah
Apr 12 14:25:50 <lufimtse>	ok.
Apr 12 14:25:50 <lufimtse>	btw
Apr 12 14:25:58 <lufimtse>	why the need to add nature to project for shell script?
Apr 12 14:26:13 <akurtakov>	because that's how dltk works
Apr 12 14:26:13 <lufimtse>	why not just enable everything for shell editor
Apr 12 14:26:28 <akurtakov>	everything there is bound to natures
Apr 12 14:26:40 <lufimtse>	I see
Apr 12 14:26:46 <akurtakov>	I don't like it either but shell script editor is pretty thin on top of dltk
Apr 12 14:27:20 <lufimtse>	suggestion: add a dialogue about adding the nature in case you open a .sh and nature is not there.
Apr 12 14:27:30 <lufimtse>	./sometime in the future... 
Apr 12 14:27:35 <akurtakov>	yeah
Apr 12 14:27:44 <lufimtse>	otherwise people probably won't know..

Apr 18 13:19:29 <akurtakov>	hey Leo
Apr 18 13:19:29 <akurtakov>	how are things?
Apr 18 14:04:57 <lufimtse>	hullo ^_^, sorry about rant.
Apr 18 14:05:01 <lufimtse>	was hungry.
Apr 18 14:05:11 <akurtakov>	?
Apr 18 14:05:17 <akurtakov>	I haven't seen anything :)
Apr 18 14:05:20 <lufimtse>	X-|
Apr 18 14:05:23 <lufimtse>	derp email
Apr 18 14:05:27 <lufimtse>	did you get email?
Apr 18 14:06:00 <lufimtse>	I'm now test sending 2 emails
Apr 18 14:06:03 <akurtakov>	let me see
Apr 18 14:06:05 <lufimtse>	one "test from Leonidas"
Apr 18 14:06:07 <akurtakov>	mail is not reliable
Apr 18 14:06:11 <lufimtse>	one "test from Lufimtsev"
Apr 18 14:06:17 <lufimtse>	let me know if both arrive
Apr 18 14:06:18 <lufimtse>	or not...
Apr 18 14:06:38 <lufimtse>	I wonder if my email alias (Leonidas) has anything to do with stuff not being sent properly.
Apr 18 14:06:53 <lufimtse>	sup anyways?
Apr 18 14:07:00 <lufimtse>	I'm working on DnD architecture atm
Apr 18 14:07:04 <akurtakov>	seen it now
Apr 18 14:07:11 <lufimtse>	which one?
Apr 18 14:07:18 <lufimtse>	the DnD or the test mail(s)?
Apr 18 14:07:23 <akurtakov>	both
Apr 18 14:07:28 <lufimtse>	oh ok.
Apr 18 14:08:00 <akurtakov>	I am fine with further refinements and etc. 
Apr 18 14:08:24 <akurtakov>	but also I want to see improvements :)
Apr 18 14:09:02 <lufimtse>	ok. But lemmme do the final thing on DnD. All other pathes are up for grabs
Apr 18 14:09:05 <lufimtse>	DnD is sensitive.
Apr 18 14:09:29 <akurtakov>	ok :)
Apr 18 14:11:21 <akurtakov>	still, no drive for initial perfection
Apr 18 14:11:27 <akurtakov>	we have to get constant improvements
Apr 18 14:11:40 <lufimtse>	It's not really perfection at this time.
Apr 18 14:11:49 <lufimtse>	We have however experienced a lot of regressions
Apr 18 14:12:04 <lufimtse>	At the moment these are not visible because of wayland
Apr 18 14:12:10 <lufimtse>	doesn't mean they're not on wayland
Apr 18 14:12:41 <lufimtse>	I have an idea in mind that could potentially resolve the majority of the regressions that we've faced
Apr 18 14:12:49 <lufimtse>	may involve some undoing.
Apr 18 14:13:02 <lufimtse>	At the moment however
Apr 18 14:13:08 <akurtakov>	like what ?
Apr 18 14:13:10 <lufimtse>	I'm evaluating how long it would take me to do that.
Apr 18 14:13:12 <lufimtse>	sec
Apr 18 14:13:28 <lufimtse>	As things stand, I think we'll continue the incremental approach till after Oxygen release
Apr 18 14:13:38 <lufimtse>	then consider the other approach that would resolve regressions
Apr 18 14:14:01 <lufimtse>	the DnD logic for wayland is currently written in such a way that a lot of widgets need fixes 
Apr 18 14:14:32 <lufimtse>	I was thinking of making it behave more like the traditional way, such that it just works out of the box and widgets wouldn't need these fixes.
Apr 18 14:14:37 <akurtakov>	examples ?
Apr 18 14:14:43 <lufimtse>	StyledText.
Apr 18 14:14:53 <lufimtse>	The new approach breaks a lot of stuff
Apr 18 14:15:10 <lufimtse>	And needs lots of fixes
Apr 18 14:15:23 <lufimtse>	the other approach I have in mind would be isolated to just control
Apr 18 14:15:33 <lufimtse>	without lots of "if !x11" statments
Apr 18 14:15:41 <akurtakov>	so fixes are needed in common widgets
Apr 18 14:15:49 <akurtakov>	not in gtk implementations
Apr 18 14:15:55 <lufimtse>	no no
Apr 18 14:16:25 <lufimtse>	currently dnd fixes for wayland are scattered across many widgets
Apr 18 14:16:30 <lufimtse>	Tree/Table/List etc..
Apr 18 14:16:31 <lufimtse>	and others
Apr 18 14:16:50 <lufimtse>	and we got StyledText to work only by manually managing outgoing SWT.Mouse* events
Apr 18 14:16:59 <lufimtse>	All that is somewhat hacky
Apr 18 14:17:17 <lufimtse>	I have an idea in mind, with which just one implementation in Control.java should resolve everything
Apr 18 14:17:31 <lufimtse>	and wouldn't require us to manually manage SWT.mouse* events and hack Tree/Table/List etc...
Apr 18 14:17:46 <lufimtse>	However, I'm still investigating this alternative approach
Apr 18 14:18:03 <akurtakov>	the question is when ?
Apr 18 14:18:06 <lufimtse>	so if I don't get it done in time this week, I'll merge in the thing that we got now that fixes StyledText ((mostly)
Apr 18 14:18:16 <lufimtse>	and continue on it in the background.
Apr 18 14:18:30 <lufimtse>	The deeper we go with the current approach, the harder it'll be to unroot the thing later.
Apr 18 14:18:40 <lufimtse>	but I understand that for oxygen we need something tangible
Apr 18 14:18:43 <lufimtse>	so balance is key.
Apr 18 14:18:47 <akurtakov>	well, the thing is our agreement has been I would have it for Wed this weeks
Apr 18 14:19:10 <lufimtse>	On the condition I wouldn't find issues
Apr 18 14:19:17 <lufimtse>	Well
Apr 18 14:19:34 <lufimtse>	gimme till thursday.
Apr 18 14:19:38 <akurtakov>	my issue is - we spend too much time on this effectively preserving us from real wayland usages (with small issues)
Apr 18 14:19:49 <akurtakov>	which will uncover even more issues
Apr 18 14:19:57 <akurtakov>	this means tomorrow 
Apr 18 14:20:49 <akurtakov>	I don't mind giving time as long as workarounds we know of are applied so real usage can be improved
Apr 18 14:21:09 <akurtakov>	I know you don't like this approach 
Apr 18 14:21:30 <lufimtse>	well
Apr 18 14:21:34 <lufimtse>	I know I know
Apr 18 14:22:01 <akurtakov>	still  we will fix this dnd under wayland but at the time of the release eclipse on wayland will be unusable due to other issues we haven't found
Apr 18 14:22:07 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 18 14:22:37 <lufimtse>	It's true that we have other issues, but DnD fixes affect mouse clicks a lot, and they mess with other things.
Apr 18 14:22:44 <lufimtse>	so if we don't get that right...
Apr 18 14:22:49 <lufimtse>	meh
Apr 18 14:23:03 <lufimtse>	for example the initial patch last week broke tab-switching with ctrl+e
Apr 18 14:23:48 <lufimtse>	I spent some time implementing logic such that postponed events actually get postponed instead of sent right away
Apr 18 14:23:50 <lufimtse>	which fixed that
Apr 18 14:23:57 <lufimtse>	but I didn't even know that my patch would fix it
Apr 18 14:24:05 <lufimtse>	I just did it because I knew it would be the better approach
Apr 18 14:24:29 <lufimtse>	at the moment I know we're heading for a lot of regressions. 
Apr 18 14:24:32 <akurtakov>	I speak of parelelizing 
Apr 18 14:24:51 <akurtakov>	technically we are not 
Apr 18 14:24:59 <akurtakov>	if nothing changes for x11 
Apr 18 14:25:20 <akurtakov>	and wayland is more usable there is no regression
Apr 18 14:25:20 <akurtakov>	:)
Apr 18 14:26:48 <akurtakov>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=514558 and etc. is smth I found while we had the broken styledtext fix in
Apr 18 14:28:11 <akurtakov>	that's what I want to enable :)
Apr 18 14:31:07 <lufimtse>	I'll research the architecture fix and if I don't make good progress, I'll merge the tennative DnD/StyledText patch Wed-evening.
Apr 18 14:31:19 <akurtakov>	ok
Apr 18 15:44:47 <lufimtse>	hulllo
Apr 18 15:44:47 *	akurtakov :No such nick/channel
Apr 19 11:20:11 <lufimtse>	----
Apr 19 11:20:11 <lufimtse>	Hey. I have a process-flow question:
Apr 19 11:20:11 <lufimtse>	I found a typo in the GtkEntry patch: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94861/  (  a '<' and '>=' are wrong way around). 
Apr 19 11:20:11 <lufimtse>	This will need to be updated. ~(2-5) lines of code. Ian's working on followup fix.
Apr 19 11:20:11 <lufimtse>	I was thinking there are two ways of doing it:
Apr 19 11:20:11 <lufimtse>	1) Revert original patch & submit new patch with minor fix. This would leave a clean atomic commit in the codebase, which would be easier to revert if we have to.
Apr 19 11:20:11 <lufimtse>	2) Just submit a followup patch that fixes the few lines. Little bit more intricate to rollback, but prevents revert.
Apr 19 11:20:11 <lufimtse>	I would prefer option 1, to just revert the original one and submit a second patch, so that it's easier to investigate things in the future. However, I would like to check this with you, is option 1 OK or is there a problem I'm not seeing with this method?
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-117-238.ams2.redhat.com]
Apr 19 11:21:11 <akurtakov>	the general path is 2) in whole platform
Apr 19 11:21:19 <akurtakov>	as it creates less noise 
Apr 19 11:21:26 <akurtakov>	aka one additional commit vs two
Apr 19 11:21:44 <lufimtse>	ok, so we should go with option 2.
Apr 19 11:21:51 <akurtakov>	yes
Apr 19 11:21:59 <akurtakov>	I generally don't care which one
Apr 19 11:22:23 <lufimtse>	Ok, thank you for clarification. We'll go with followup patch.
Apr 19 11:22:26 <akurtakov>	but I'm also not looking into arguing with people why we created "extra noise" (tm)
Apr 19 11:22:46 <akurtakov>	note that "extra noise" is really the exact words IBMers use :)
Apr 19 11:24:12 <akurtakov>	tbh, I should put you and Markus to confront approaches directly sometime
Apr 19 11:24:21 <akurtakov>	it would be fun watching :)
Apr 19 11:50:25 <lufimtse>	lol
Apr 19 11:50:27 <lufimtse>	nuclear war
Apr 19 11:50:37 <lufimtse>	He's ok. 
Apr 19 11:50:47 <lufimtse>	usually finds bugs in my code. decent guy.
Apr 19 11:51:46 <lufimtse>	Found a bunch of other things in Ian's GtkEntry text patch. Might be a 10-15 lines change. I get a sense that Ian is not fond of the word 'revert', so I'll be ok with just a followup patch
Apr 19 11:51:49 <akurtakov>	consider yourself lucky to have such experience :)
Apr 19 11:52:04 <lufimtse>	But for my own patches, I'd rather revert and re-commit.
Apr 19 11:52:24 <akurtakov>	tbh, there is no difference for me :)
Apr 19 11:52:27 <lufimtse>	X-D
Apr 19 11:52:48 <akurtakov>	I'm even amused that people care about such things
Apr 19 11:53:04 <lufimtse>	ok, I'll work on merging in the tennative SWT.Mouse* patch, (with the intent of reverting later...). But for now we'll have working DnD in styledText.
Apr 19 11:53:13 <lufimtse>	yay
Apr 19 11:53:21 <lufimtse>	and custom widgets etc...
Apr 19 11:53:25 <lufimtse>	part-dragging etc..
Apr 19 11:53:37 <akurtakov>	what would not be working ?
Apr 19 11:53:37 <lufimtse>	phew
Apr 19 11:53:45 <lufimtse>	slight glitches here and there
Apr 19 11:54:00 <lufimtse>	like selection of single character is only done on mouseUp, not while dragging.
Apr 19 11:54:17 <lufimtse>	which might feel counter intuitive
Apr 19 11:54:20 <lufimtse>	until you know it.
Apr 19 11:54:25 <lufimtse>	but you might not notice...
Apr 19 11:54:32 <akurtakov>	if this is the biggest issue on wayland we are good :)
Apr 19 11:54:52 <lufimtse>	and there's that risk of unknown regressions since flow of events is a bit different than before.
Apr 19 11:54:54 <lufimtse>	but meh
Apr 19 11:54:57 <lufimtse>	it'll work for now.
Apr 19 11:55:04 <lufimtse>	then later we'll change things.
Apr 19 11:55:29 <akurtakov>	exactly, as you have seen with webkit - I was really pushing for the right fix
Apr 19 11:55:51 <akurtakov>	but once we hit M6 the rules of the game change drastically
Apr 19 11:56:15 <akurtakov>	overtime you'll get used to that too :)
Apr 19 11:56:58 <lufimtse>	I see
Apr 19 11:57:37 <akurtakov>	if/when people start working on dozen++ projects each with their own rules they stop caring about "philosophical" things like revert+new or followup is better 
Apr 19 11:57:57 <lufimtse>	he he 
Apr 19 11:57:58 <lufimtse>	I see
Apr 19 11:57:59 <akurtakov>	all you care is get it working so you can move on to one of next few hundred things pending :)
Apr 19 11:58:06 <lufimtse>	X-D
Apr 19 11:58:31 <akurtakov>	e.g. now I'm between jetty update and CVE in batik 
Apr 19 11:58:32 <akurtakov>	wtf
Apr 19 12:17:26 <lufimtse>	CVE batik?
Apr 19 12:17:30 <lufimtse>	jetty?
Apr 19 12:17:43 <lufimtse>	patch review wise?
Apr 19 12:39:32 <akurtakov>	security issue in batik so I have to see whether eclipse is involved
Apr 19 12:39:37 <akurtakov>	err, affected
Apr 19 12:39:43 <lufimtse>	i c
Apr 19 12:39:43 <akurtakov>	update it in fedora
Apr 19 12:39:55 <akurtakov>	and eventually update batik in orbit too
Apr 19 12:40:08 <akurtakov>	jetty has to be updated to 9.4.4 for oxygen release

Apr 25 08:45:17 <akurtakov>	hey
Apr 25 08:45:41 <lufimtse>	do you have commiter rights to eclipse.platform.text?  https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/86768/
Apr 25 08:45:47 <akurtakov>	yes
Apr 25 08:46:02 <akurtakov>	I asked on the patch
Apr 25 08:46:13 <akurtakov>	but Lars comment puzzled me
Apr 25 08:46:48 <lufimtse>	Ah, I didn't update gerrit 
Apr 25 08:46:50 <lufimtse>	lemme read
Apr 25 08:47:06 <lufimtse>	yea
Apr 25 08:47:08 <lufimtse>	basically same thing
Apr 25 08:47:16 <lufimtse>	except that now it's not stylable in options
Apr 25 08:47:40 <lufimtse>	this makes it consistent with other dialogues, e.g ctrl+space code completion (which is not stylable either).
Apr 25 08:47:46 <lufimtse>	by stylable, I mean user selecting colour
Apr 25 08:47:54 <lufimtse>	it's still stylable in dark theme etc..
Apr 25 08:47:59 <lufimtse>	see screenshot in bug
Apr 25 08:48:05 <akurtakov>	I saw it
Apr 25 08:48:25 <akurtakov>	please commen on the gerrit and maybe edit the commit message to make it clear
Apr 25 08:48:30 <lufimtse>	ok.
Apr 25 08:48:39 <akurtakov>	it's quite hard for someone not following to get what's going on :)
Apr 25 08:48:43 <akurtakov>	even for me :)
Apr 25 08:49:59 <akurtakov>	mind you - I look at 10+ different things per day 
Apr 25 08:50:02 <lufimtse>	I posted comment.

Apr 25 08:55:27 <lufimtse>	ok, I was about to update commit messsage ^_^, but ok.
Apr 25 08:55:45 <akurtakov>	meh, sorry
Apr 25 08:55:48 <lufimtse>	^_^
Apr 25 08:56:03 <lufimtse>	ok, one bug down, bunch left to go.
Apr 25 08:57:18 <lufimtse>	My todo list related to Colour fixes: http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1493125016.png
Apr 25 11:56:20 <akurtakov>	that's insane
Apr 25 11:56:31 <akurtakov>	I don't get it how you navigate in it :)
Apr 25 12:03:53 <lufimtse>	well, it's part of my bigger workspace:
Apr 25 12:03:53 <lufimtse>	http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1493136219.png
Apr 25 12:04:05 <lufimtse>	I zoom out, then zoom back into the relevant section
Apr 25 12:04:16 <lufimtse>	I guess I'm a fairly visual person
Apr 25 12:08:29 <akurtakov>	I mean it looks not structured to me :)
Apr 25 12:08:29 <akurtakov>	as long as it works for you :)
Apr 25 12:08:37 <lufimtse>	X-D
Apr 25 12:09:35 <lufimtse>	I found that I often have to deal with dependencies between tasks, share information between tasks etc...
Apr 25 12:09:46 <lufimtse>	diagram is good for those non-linear projects
Apr 25 14:54:32 <lufimtse>	when you have time, I emailed you some patch reviewes.
Apr 28 13:05:18 <lufimtse>	Initially changing the org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk project warning settings seemed like a good idea, but it turns out I haven't tested it enough. I guess I don't have that much platfrom.ui experience to having been able to foresee that issue. Will try to be more attentive in future.
Apr 28 13:05:24 <lufimtse>	Revert: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/96053/
Apr 28 13:08:21 <lufimtse>	akurtakov hey
Apr 28 13:08:37 <lufimtse>	akurtakov noise aside, there is reason to revert the patch
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-116-170.ams2.redhat.com]
Apr 28 13:08:44 <akurtakov>	yup
Apr 28 13:09:13 <lufimtse>	akurtakov with the current settings, actually I don't notice the problem, with the setting I do notice the problem and can do something about it
Apr 28 13:09:16 <akurtakov>	I have abandoned
Apr 28 13:09:28 <akurtakov>	the change
Apr 28 13:09:33 <lufimtse>	akurtakov ?
Apr 28 13:09:42 <lufimtse>	akurtakov why
Apr 28 13:09:46 <lufimtse>	akurtakov doesn't make sense? 
Apr 28 13:09:57 <lufimtse>	akurtakov like from logical point of view, maybe I'm missing something?
Apr 28 13:10:10 <akurtakov>	noone should see compile error
Apr 28 13:10:24 <akurtakov>	as we know it violates access control
Apr 28 13:10:31 <akurtakov>	and did it that way on purpose
Apr 28 13:10:46 <lufimtse>	akurtakov I see. In that case, I did not provide full information
Apr 28 13:10:46 <akurtakov>	so even if one has set his workspace with stricter rules
Apr 28 13:10:51 <akurtakov>	this plugin is fine
Apr 28 13:10:52 <lufimtse>	akurtakov let me explain:
Apr 28 13:11:01 <lufimtse>	akurtakov with fixed target platform, there is no compile error
Apr 28 13:11:07 <lufimtse>	akurtakov I forgot to mention this
Apr 28 13:11:09 <lufimtse>	akurtakov my bad
Apr 28 13:11:29 <lufimtse>	akurtakov with correct target platform, all works and no compile errors
Apr 28 13:11:37 <lufimtse>	akurtakov (without custom settings)
Apr 28 13:11:43 <lufimtse>	akurtakov basically I kinda screwed up
Apr 28 13:11:50 <lufimtse>	akurtakov unknowingly
Apr 28 13:12:24 <lufimtse>	i.e the compile error only pops up with partial target platform
Apr 28 13:12:49 <lufimtse>	as such, it makes sense to have the patch reverted, so that one can find if one has a broken target platform at compile time
Apr 28 13:12:55 <akurtakov>	anyway, it doesn't hurt to have it fine for people that have just this plugin and no target platform
Apr 28 13:12:57 <lufimtse>	does that make sense?
Apr 28 13:13:27 <lufimtse>	sec
Apr 28 13:17:00 <lufimtse>	Without a target platform, there are other errors either way. So it doesn't help those people either:
Apr 28 13:17:10 <lufimtse>	http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1493399824.png
Apr 28 13:17:18 <lufimtse>	Am I missing something?
Apr 28 13:17:40 <lufimtse>	Like, it seemed like a good idea 20 minutes ago, but now with complete information at hand, my patch is counterproductive
Apr 28 13:17:51 <lufimtse>	there is no situation in which it is beneficial
Apr 28 13:18:22 <lufimtse>	I basically didn't spend enough time testing
Apr 28 13:18:34 <lufimtse>	was rushing too much >_<
Apr 28 13:20:43 <lufimtse>	Based on what I currently know (I may be missing something?), I suggest to restore the revert and revert: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/96053/
Apr 28 13:22:13 <akurtakov>	I'll be fine making the one setting you changed stronger
Apr 28 13:22:16 <akurtakov>	but not reverting
Apr 28 13:22:41 <lufimtse>	Is reverting a big political problem?
Apr 28 13:22:48 <akurtakov>	I do believe every plugin should have custom settings so each contributor sees exactly the same set of issues
Apr 28 13:22:56 <akurtakov>	as what happens when there are none
Apr 28 13:23:06 <lufimtse>	hmmmm
Apr 28 13:23:13 <akurtakov>	is that many people setup their default settings very low
Apr 28 13:23:17 <akurtakov>	seeing no warning
Apr 28 13:23:29 <akurtakov>	and people working on harder rules
Apr 28 13:23:35 <lufimtse>	ok,
Apr 28 13:23:37 <lufimtse>	that's valid
Apr 28 13:23:39 <akurtakov>	see more and more and go after others fixing it
Apr 28 13:23:49 <lufimtse>	Ok, how about I up the setting to error again?
Apr 28 13:23:53 <lufimtse>	that should solve things
Apr 28 13:24:03 <lufimtse>	specific to that bundle
Apr 28 13:24:11 <lufimtse>	as per above
Apr 28 13:24:43 <akurtakov>	go on
Apr 28 13:24:45 <lufimtse>	ok
Apr 28 13:24:59 <akurtakov>	think of it that way - even if it was another issue
Apr 28 13:25:05 <akurtakov>	we should take the benefit from it 
Apr 28 13:25:18 <akurtakov>	aka have consistent project settings for every contributor :)
Apr 28 13:25:27 <lufimtse>	I agree with that
Apr 28 13:25:59 <akurtakov>	which would have the nice effect if it works for everyone else
Apr 28 13:26:06 <akurtakov>	and there are project settings 
Apr 28 13:26:13 <akurtakov>	the issue is in your TV :)
Apr 28 13:28:02 <lufimtse>	TV?
Apr 28 13:28:42 <akurtakov>	as a teenager I worked in TV sell/repair shop
Apr 28 13:28:55 <lufimtse>	I see
Apr 28 13:28:57 <lufimtse>	he he
Apr 28 13:29:12 <akurtakov>	and it was quite funny to find when it's cable operator problem and when a TV issue
Apr 28 13:29:28 <akurtakov>	as in electronics problem in the TV
Apr 28 13:30:05 <akurtakov>	the old analogue stuff could lower image quality for many reasons
Apr 28 13:33:39 <akurtakov>	guys used to measure every single condenser one by one :)

Apr 28 13:34:59 <lufimtse>	interesting

Apr 28 13:38:03 <lufimtse>	child eclipse switches themes well with it.
Apr 28 13:38:09 <lufimtse>	with that merge, I can sleep well at night.
Apr 28 13:39:55 <lufimtse>	I'm off to lunch
Apr 28 13:40:09 <akurtakov>	and I'll be for weekend once I push this one
Apr 28 14:35:48 <lufimtse>	have a nice one

May 10 10:59:11 <akurtakov>	just fyi - if you want to get into some more managerial role there are 2 things
May 10 10:59:42 <akurtakov>	1. always keep an eye on what you have started/changed and drive it to be finished - that's how you will gain trust in the community
May 10 11:00:00 <lufimtse>	ok
May 10 11:00:02 <akurtakov>	2. improve your task switching capabilities 
May 10 11:00:03 <lufimtse>	thank you for tip.
May 10 11:00:05 <lufimtse>	X-D
May 10 11:00:17 <akurtakov>	the later is kind of a prereq for the first
May 10 11:00:34 <akurtakov>	as over time you will have touched many things so you would have to do more and more task switching
May 10 11:02:31 <lufimtse>	I see
May 10 11:02:38 <lufimtse>	the task switching is hard
May 10 11:02:45 <lufimtse>	easy to get carried away with a single thing.
May 10 11:03:12 <akurtakov>	I know but at the time you're leading a project/team
May 10 11:03:45 <akurtakov>	one should be ready to delegate the longterm tasks
May 10 11:04:05 <akurtakov>	and constantly switch between the multiple longterm tasks ongoing to keep an eye on them
May 10 11:04:16 <akurtakov>	and still be able to do some his work on his own
May 10 11:04:25 <akurtakov>	that's the curse of these positions
May 10 11:04:34 <lufimtse>	X-D
May 10 11:15:29 <lufimtse>	It turns out I had my gmail filters miss-configured
May 10 11:15:50 <lufimtse>	I was using single quotes, but with that only the first element is found.
May 10 11:15:51 <lufimtse>	like:
May 10 11:15:59 <lufimtse>	('element1' OR 'element2')
May 10 11:16:02 <lufimtse>	element2 not found
May 10 11:16:08 <lufimtse>	I found with double quotes it works:
May 10 11:16:16 <lufimtse>	("element1" OR "element")
May 10 11:16:35 <lufimtse>	This means I have been missing bugs where I'm assignee but not CC'ed for a long time....
May 10 11:16:54 <lufimtse>	but there aren't that many bugs assigned to me, so that shouldn't be a big problem.

May 19 10:45:51 <akurtakov>	ok, that should be fine
May 19 10:47:04 <lufimtse_>	from what I gather he'll be working on the C# stuff
May 19 10:47:11 <lufimtse_>	of which I have no understanding at all lol.
May 19 10:47:12 <akurtakov>	at least initially
May 19 10:47:27 <lufimtse_>	but I could help him with like an initial platform.ui patch of sorts
May 19 10:47:28 <akurtakov>	much like you worked on the releng tools initially :)
May 19 10:47:49 <akurtakov>	so he gets the basics - extensions, extension points and etc.
May 19 10:48:11 <lufimtse_>	Is there a sample project/bug that you thought for him to work on, or should I look for something/
May 19 10:48:24 <akurtakov>	https://github.com/mickaelistria/aCute/issues/10
May 19 10:48:47 <akurtakov>	btw, if we have to demo improvements in SWT for Oxygen what would you think of demoing
May 19 10:49:09 <lufimtse_>	hmmm
May 19 10:49:20 <lufimtse_>	well, swt hasn't changed, we just had bugfixes
May 19 10:49:32 <lufimtse_>	the dark theme is probably the biggest one.
May 19 10:49:58 <akurtakov>	the thing is that from management POV a lot of resources go into that
May 19 10:50:05 <lufimtse_>	I see.
May 19 10:50:06 <akurtakov>	so we would better be able to demo smth
May 19 10:50:09 <lufimtse_>	Hmmm.
May 19 10:50:18 <akurtakov>	but I fully agree there isn't much
May 19 10:50:19 <akurtakov>	if anything
May 19 10:50:29 <lufimtse_>	It's really maintenance that's the heavy lifting
May 19 10:50:53 <akurtakov>	I'm thinking of a totally broken neon on wayland followed by oxygen on wayland for comparison
May 19 10:50:54 <lufimtse_>	for example the webkit2 port was needed for eclipse to workin on future Fedora versions
May 19 10:51:11 <lufimtse_>	hmm
May 19 10:51:31 <akurtakov>	nothing I really expect from you just asking you for any hints if it comes to your mind
May 19 10:52:26 <lufimtse_>	I think one thing that can be mentioned is that on webkit1, eclipse would crash randomly. We had quite a number of reports. With webkit2 we don't have crashes. It's something that can be mentioned as a point on a slide 
May 19 10:52:49 <akurtakov>	well, I'm really thinking of demo
May 19 10:52:49 <lufimtse_>	hmmm
May 19 10:52:59 <akurtakov>	but there isn't much
May 19 10:53:14 <lufimtse_>	What about having slides on the demo
May 19 10:53:16 <akurtakov>	other than a series of broken vs. fixed :)
May 19 10:53:26 <lufimtse_>	and explain what was done
May 19 10:53:46 <lufimtse_>	The work was really fixing the engine of the car there
May 19 10:53:51 <lufimtse_>	not so much the exteriour 
May 19 10:54:18 <lufimtse_>	hmmm
May 19 10:54:38 <lufimtse_>	One possibility is to show snippets that were broken and how we fixed them.
May 19 10:54:47 <akurtakov>	more of tinsmith work :)
May 19 10:54:59 <akurtakov>	auto tinsmith :)
May 19 10:55:02 <lufimtse_>	tinsmith?
May 19 10:55:16 <akurtakov>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinsmith
May 19 10:55:43 <akurtakov>	aka repair car tin after it was hit by "new version" of a library :)
May 19 10:55:47 <lufimtse_>	I see
May 19 10:56:03 <akurtakov>	that would bebest description I can give :)
May 19 10:56:19 <lufimtse_>	btw, if at any point you find that swt is pretty stable but some other project needs dire attention, I could do some work on the other project. I'm pretty flexible.
May 19 10:56:26 <lufimtse_>	But I'm happy in swt as things are
May 19 10:56:29 <lufimtse_>	just fyi.
May 19 10:56:48 <akurtakov>	we need wayland and webkit really improved
May 19 10:56:56 <lufimtse_>	ok
May 19 10:57:03 <akurtakov>	and once eric is back he has to finish colors 
May 19 10:57:12 <akurtakov>	and a11y
May 19 10:57:17 <lufimtse_>	a11y?
May 19 10:57:40 <akurtakov>	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a11y :)
May 19 10:57:41 <lufimtse_>	thought: I could demo an eclipse crash. It happens with one of the snippets.
May 19 10:58:08 <lufimtse_>	ally X-D, Oh God.
May 19 10:58:16 <lufimtse_>	that's a sad area.
May 19 10:58:49 <akurtakov>	after that (assuming nothing big popped up meanwhile) we can think of further work
May 19 10:59:24 <lufimtse_>	But anyhows, if you like, I could try to come up with a list of things done on Eclipse and email you a list of sorts.
May 19 10:59:28 <lufimtse_>	is there a due-date for this?
May 19 10:59:40 <akurtakov>	no, it's just a food for thought for now
May 19 10:59:40 <lufimtse_>	btw, who is your management, patrick or other folks?
May 19 10:59:44 <lufimtse_>	ok.
May 19 11:00:02 <akurtakov>	as with the developer program and more and more visual presentations done for sprints
May 19 11:00:13 <akurtakov>	it would be nice if we represent the swt work there too
May 19 11:00:42 <lufimtse_>	I'm really thinking more in way of slides and explaining maintenance rather than some live version of Eclipse.
May 19 11:00:46 <lufimtse_>	just my thought....
May 19 11:00:55 <akurtakov>	as it's a lot of work and somehow the show is stolen from hyperlink support in che
May 19 11:01:01 <akurtakov>	people don't read IMHO 
May 19 11:01:13 <lufimtse_>	Add pictures to slides.
May 19 11:01:22 <lufimtse_>	works wonders
May 19 11:01:40 <akurtakov>	yeah, let's think what we can add for the next sprint
May 19 11:01:43 <akurtakov>	in 3 weeks
May 19 11:01:47 <akurtakov>	if anything
May 19 11:02:09 <lufimtse_>	ok
May 19 11:02:10 <lufimtse_>	btw
May 19 11:02:15 <lufimtse_>	about Lukas
May 19 11:02:35 <lufimtse_>	I have no idea on how to even get started on:https://github.com/mickaelistria/aCute/issues/10
May 19 11:02:51 <lufimtse_>	lol
May 19 11:03:01 <akurtakov>	https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TryingOutDotnetNewTemplateUpdatesAndCsprojWithVS2017.aspx
May 19 11:03:53 <akurtakov>	I expect details on the task to be set from Mickael/Sopot and you (plural - in the office) help him when he hits technical hurdle
May 19 11:04:41 <lufimtse_>	Ok, let me bug Mickael on the matter
May 19 11:04:58 <akurtakov>	please keep it for monday
May 19 11:04:59 <akurtakov>	http://git.eclipse.org/c/linuxtools/org.eclipse.linuxtools.git/tree/rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui/plugin.xml#n67
May 19 11:05:10 <akurtakov>	is a sample
May 19 11:05:36 <lufimtse_>	note, Monday is holiday here
May 19 11:05:47 <akurtakov>	for now let Lucas do some tutorial style things to get familiar with eclipse dev
May 19 11:05:52 <lufimtse_>	ok
May 19 11:06:03 <lufimtse_>	I setup a sample java project for him.
May 19 11:06:15 <akurtakov>	overall it should be a wizard like the rpm one
May 19 11:06:27 <akurtakov>	it calls rpmdevtools underneath
May 19 11:07:08 <akurtakov>	the dotnet one should call what's described in https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TryingOutDotnetNewTemplateUpdatesAndCsprojWithVS2017.aspx
May 19 11:09:35 <akurtakov>	actually http://git.eclipse.org/c/linuxtools/org.eclipse.linuxtools.git/tree/rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/plugin.xml#n265 is better
May 19 11:10:29 <akurtakov>	anyway, please don't push him too much from the beginning
May 19 11:12:14 <lufimtse_>	ok :-D

May 25 09:02:48 <akurtakov>	hey Leo
May 25 09:03:30 <lufimtse>	morning
May 25 09:03:55 <akurtakov>	hey, just to clarify until oxygen is branched we are in really deep freeze
May 25 09:04:01 <akurtakov>	only crashers more or less
May 25 09:04:08 <lufimtse>	ah
May 25 09:04:09 <lufimtse>	ok
May 25 09:04:11 <akurtakov>	I'll push to get the branching early this year
May 25 09:04:20 <akurtakov>	but can't promise anything
May 25 09:04:22 <lufimtse>	thank you for information
May 25 09:04:25 <lufimtse>	helpful
May 25 09:04:47 <akurtakov>	how are  things otherwise?
May 25 09:04:48 <akurtakov>	https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/freeze_plan_4_7.php#FixPassAfterRC0
May 25 09:04:57 <lufimtse>	pretty good.
May 25 09:05:00 <akurtakov>	as you can see for RC3 it's really tough
May 25 09:05:13 <akurtakov>	Two additional committers and a component lead must +1 your bug report (3 people who are not the one making the change).
May 25 09:05:22 <lufimtse>	I may run through the Browser api to check that all of it works on webkit2
May 25 09:05:28 <lufimtse>	and there is the return value of browser function...
May 25 09:05:28 <akurtakov>	cool
May 25 09:05:40 <akurtakov>	yeah, it wold be nice if we can deliver that in M1 too :)
May 25 09:05:51 <lufimtse>	As I observed with getText, the fact that all tests pass don't mean all api is ported.
May 25 09:06:20 <akurtakov>	btw, have you thought of having an e.g. day of the week where you deal with other bugs not the long ongoing ones ?
May 25 09:06:45 <akurtakov>	aka ding bz triaging or fixing easy ones or working on other projects ?
May 25 09:06:55 <akurtakov>	I'll be quite fine with that up until M4 :)
May 25 09:07:07 <akurtakov>	it's really useful to refresh mind IMHO :)
May 25 09:07:51 <lufimtse>	I'm veeerryy flexible with these things.
May 25 09:07:59 <lufimtse>	I'm usually happy to work on anything needs working on.
May 25 09:08:23 <akurtakov>	I mean spending a day per week on what you think needs fixing
May 25 09:08:40 <akurtakov>	aka scratch your own itch
May 25 09:08:58 <lufimtse>	Hmmm
May 25 09:09:15 <lufimtse>	I guess that's how the whole color thing got started X-D
May 25 09:09:24 <akurtakov>	yeah :)
May 25 09:09:32 <akurtakov>	and I'm encouraging it :)
May 25 09:09:37 <lufimtse>	X-D
May 25 09:09:40 <akurtakov>	to happen regularly 
May 25 09:10:12 <lufimtse>	At the moment I'm plowing through my todo list: bit.ly/LeosBugs
May 25 09:11:09 <akurtakov>	sure
May 25 09:11:30 <akurtakov>	what I'm suggesting is us having bigger and regular influence over other projects as we use them daily
May 25 09:11:50 <akurtakov>	and we can afford this only early in the cycle as later the game gets way tougher
May 25 09:11:51 <lufimtse>	You mean like platform.ui?
May 25 09:12:01 <akurtakov>	or jdt or mylyn 
May 25 09:12:40 <lufimtse>	Is the line of thought pick one of those, (like platform.ui, jdt, mylyn) and spend more time on one of those in particular, or a little bit in each one?
May 25 09:13:07 <akurtakov>	as you decide for a day per week, wdyt?
May 25 09:13:24 <akurtakov>	I'm really looking into making the ide works best for us :)
May 25 09:13:52 <lufimtse>	I see
May 25 09:14:24 <akurtakov>	and practicing the decompression principle for few months :)
May 25 09:14:55 <lufimtse>	X-D
May 25 09:15:20 <lufimtse>	I made a note of it. I wrote "1 day a week of decompression" on a sticky note and put it on one of my monitors.
May 25 09:15:28 <akurtakov>	:)
May 25 09:16:12 <lufimtse>	I looked into triage a bit.
May 25 09:16:18 <lufimtse>	there is the notion of assesing bugs
May 25 09:16:24 <lufimtse>	and then assigning them to swt-triage
May 25 09:16:53 <akurtakov>	well, this  used to work when there was dedicated qe team from ibm
May 25 09:17:01 <akurtakov>	I don't think anyone looks at that anymore 
May 25 09:19:37 <lufimtse>	We have 2023 bugs on swt-inbox and around 507 on swt-triage
May 25 09:19:41 <lufimtse>	hmmm
May 25 09:19:45 <lufimtse>	and growing
May 25 09:21:29 <akurtakov>	I keep track on SWT/GTK only
May 25 09:21:51 <lufimtse>	I see
May 25 09:21:56 <akurtakov>	and it's down at 937 from 1300+ a year ago

Jun 23 12:52:41 <akurtakov>	here?
Jun 23 12:52:48 <lufimtse>	yea
Jun 23 12:52:48 <lufimtse>	sup
Jun 23 12:53:11 <akurtakov>	remember when you told me about you willing to become SWT lead
Jun 23 12:53:31 <lufimtse>	yea
Jun 23 12:53:53 <akurtakov>	so there might be a chance now
Jun 23 12:53:57 <lufimtse>	oooeee
Jun 23 12:54:06 <lufimtse>	Tell me more.
Jun 23 12:54:09 <akurtakov>	although if we merge the projects into single project
Jun 23 12:54:16 <akurtakov>	there will be no such lead
Jun 23 12:54:26 <akurtakov>	but we will be moving to some kind of maintainers
Jun 23 12:54:41 <akurtakov>	https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/MAINTAINERS
Jun 23 12:54:44 <akurtakov>	like ^^
Jun 23 12:54:58 <akurtakov>	and in this case I would like ot have you there as swt one
Jun 23 12:55:27 <akurtakov>	conversation has to stay confidential
Jun 23 12:55:42 <akurtakov>	but Arun will be moving to another team in the not so distant future
Jun 23 12:55:54 <lufimtse>	Hmmmm
Jun 23 12:56:06 <akurtakov>	and someone from our team would better become the lead/maintainer
Jun 23 12:56:39 <akurtakov>	he was thinking of me but I pointed as you as I think you'll do way better job by being more focused
Jun 23 12:57:01 <akurtakov>	there will be replacmeent for him at IBM
Jun 23 12:57:08 <lufimtse>	From a career point of view, it would be cool if I'd be one of the Leads.
Jun 23 12:57:14 <akurtakov>	it's not like IBM is downsizing
Jun 23 12:57:19 <lufimtse>	Something nice on the resume...
Jun 23 12:57:22 <lufimtse>	I see.
Jun 23 12:57:48 <lufimtse>	And interesting experience..
Jun 23 12:58:00 <lufimtse>	I'd be down for SWT lead business.
Jun 23 12:58:01 <akurtakov>	well, soon we should have single Platform project to ease collaboration
Jun 23 12:58:16 <akurtakov>	it doesn't bother swt that much
Jun 23 12:58:21 <lufimtse>	When is soon?
Jun 23 12:58:28 <akurtakov>	I hope in the next few months
Jun 23 12:58:41 <akurtakov>	but for the rest it matters a lot
Jun 23 12:58:53 <akurtakov>	platform ui and team and debug.ui and so on
Jun 23 12:59:00 <akurtakov>	share the same concerns mostly
Jun 23 12:59:13 <lufimtse>	Even if it's just for a few months, being SWT Lead for that time would be great :-).
Jun 23 12:59:44 <akurtakov>	well we will have you as SWT maintainer 
Jun 23 13:00:02 <akurtakov>	which is kind of similar
Jun 23 13:00:10 <akurtakov>	not sure which one will happen first
Jun 23 13:00:23 <akurtakov>	Arun was not sure when his move will be effective
Jun 23 13:00:31 <lufimtse>	ok
Jun 23 13:00:32 <akurtakov>	and if the merge process started when he moves
Jun 23 13:00:41 <akurtakov>	there will be no new leads
Jun 23 13:01:01 <lufimtse>	I see.
Jun 23 13:01:12 <lufimtse>	Ok, let's keep an eye on it
Jun 23 13:01:39 <akurtakov>	and again please keep this private until info is public by Arun
Jun 23 13:01:48 <lufimtse>	ok. Thank you for heads up.
Jun 23 13:02:41 <akurtakov>	you're welcome
Jun 23 13:03:06 <akurtakov>	I told you back then that new leads are appointed when the new one gives up or becomse inactive
Jun 23 13:18:31 <lufimtse>	I'm investigating https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/82005/
Jun 23 13:18:43 <lufimtse>	I'm somewhat not in favour.
Jun 23 13:18:46 <lufimtse>	Will post reasons.
Jun 23 13:19:14 <akurtakov>	I asked Eric to take a look at it
Jun 23 13:19:27 <akurtakov>	I haven't looked at it to even have my opinion :)
Jun 23 13:19:44 <akurtakov>	aka I'm really delegating work toyou guys :)
Jun 23 13:20:07 <akurtakov>	if you wonder why I asked Eric - because you have a bunch of other things on your plate :)
Jun 23 13:20:26 <lufimtse>	X-D
Jun 23 13:23:00 <akurtakov>	this is one of my attempts to bring more contributions
Jun 23 13:23:11 <lufimtse>	that is a terrible contribution
Jun 23 13:23:12 <lufimtse>	imho
Jun 23 13:23:21 <lufimtse>	http://www.artima.com/intv/bloch13.html
Jun 23 13:23:29 <akurtakov>	I think that we should pay more attention to people that have opened gerrits a lot of attention
Jun 23 13:23:46 <akurtakov>	as they have already spend time to checkout codee and etc.
Jun 23 13:23:51 <lufimtse>	I see
Jun 23 13:23:57 <lufimtse>	yea, I agree that we should give contributions love
Jun 23 13:23:59 <lufimtse>	:-)
Jun 23 13:24:00 <akurtakov>	even if we say no - it should be argument and 
Jun 23 13:24:13 <akurtakov>	the gerrit abandoned after discusion and etc.
Jun 23 13:24:18 <akurtakov>	but it should not stay unattended
Jun 23 13:24:24 <lufimtse>	My line of thought was like "Thank you very much for this contribution. However, have you considerd X,Y,Z ..."
Jun 23 13:24:37 <lufimtse>	I see
Jun 23 13:24:42 <akurtakov>	https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/project:platform/eclipse.platform.swt+status:open
Jun 23 13:24:42 <lufimtse>	yea, good point.
Jun 23 13:25:00 <akurtakov>	3 pages is not good :)
Jun 23 13:25:36 <akurtakov>	but maybe if you start pushing the browser tests we will get to 2 pages :)
Jun 23 13:25:42 <lufimtse>	Ah
Jun 23 13:25:48 <lufimtse>	akurtakov thank you for that link
Jun 23 13:25:57 <lufimtse>	I will investigate those patch submissions.
Jun 23 13:26:01 <lufimtse>	2014 :-|
Jun 23 13:26:02 <lufimtse>	omg
Jun 23 13:26:04 <akurtakov>	anyway,  more attention to that is needed 
Jun 23 13:26:10 <akurtakov>	tell me about it 
Jun 23 13:26:17 <akurtakov>	I'm going through p2 now
Jun 23 13:26:24 <akurtakov>	and it's not like I have experience there
Jun 23 13:26:34 <akurtakov>	I feel like the time I need for one patch in p2
Jun 23 13:26:37 <lufimtse>	Ok, I'll dedicate some love to that gerrit submission queue
Jun 23 13:26:44 <akurtakov>	is more than for 5 patches in swt :)
Jun 23 13:26:58 <akurtakov>	think of throwing you at e.g. jdt to review patches :)
Jun 23 13:27:43 <akurtakov>	but p2 is crucial and unloved for long enough :(
Jun 23 13:28:20 <akurtakov>	I'm down to 2 screens there :)
Jun 23 13:28:28 <akurtakov>	oldest still from 2014
Jun 23 13:28:56 <akurtakov>	but I found it easier to start with latest submissions as people are more responsive if they haven't waited few years :)
Jun 23 13:29:03 <akurtakov>	I have to go out now
Jun 23 13:29:07 <akurtakov>	enjoy your weekend
Jun 23 13:30:19 <akurtakov>	it's a big fight to open up the project and make contributors feel welcomed
Jun 23 13:30:32 <akurtakov>	this is entirely new front of the battle we open :)
Jun 23 13:33:31 <lufimtse>	I feel like I need to read a book on "How to manage open source projects and be loving to contribitours" :-). Have a nice weekend also.

Jun 28 09:57:12 <akurtakov>	so what is going on ?
Jun 28 09:57:47 <lufimtse>	hullo
Jun 28 09:57:52 <lufimtse>	how's life?
Jun 28 09:57:58 <akurtakov>	busy :)
Jun 28 09:58:01 <akurtakov>	yours?
Jun 28 09:58:08 <lufimtse>	^_^
Jun 28 09:58:57 <lufimtse>	atm setting up a machine to try and automate the jUnit testing across platform. Mac laptop with Win/Linux vms. That should make it easier to add jUnits without worrying about breaking other platforms.
Jun 28 09:59:32 <akurtakov>	well, it would minimize the breakage
Jun 28 10:00:01 <akurtakov>	as we have seen the fact it works on fedora doesnt' mean it does on rhel 6/7/centos/ubuntu/sles :)
Jun 28 10:00:10 <akurtakov>	same for mac/win versions :)
Jun 28 10:02:26 <lufimtse>	I could setup a CentOS Vm and add it to the server fleet.
Jun 28 10:02:41 <akurtakov>	that's not the point :)
Jun 28 10:02:54 <akurtakov>	it will never be at the same level of updates as the foundation one
Jun 28 10:03:04 <akurtakov>	and different webkit/gtk cause issues :)
Jun 28 10:03:25 <lufimtse>	Currently I'm working on having: Win32/Cocoa/Gtk2/Gtk3.22
Jun 28 10:03:43 <lufimtse>	that should cover most things.
Jun 28 10:04:05 <akurtakov>	don't even bother with gtk2
Jun 28 10:04:22 <lufimtse>	he he
Jun 28 10:04:36 <lufimtse>	I see
Jun 28 11:24:24 <akurtakov>	so do you want to wait for the additional servers before pushing the browser tests?
Jun 28 11:25:25 <lufimtse>	Ah, I didn't set time expectations. I should have some basic setup by end of week or ealy next week. Then I can merge in the browser tests
Jun 28 11:26:10 <akurtakov>	I still think pushing them one by one starting now is good idea
Jun 28 11:26:49 <akurtakov>	not conflicting with having your test machines :)
Jun 28 11:47:50 <lufimtse>	Once one of my tests caused an I.E window to be spawned on Windows and it was floating around the desktop. Someone had to connect to hudson and get rid of it.
Jun 28 11:48:00 <akurtakov>	:)
Jun 28 11:48:12 <lufimtse>	So I now treat browser tests with care...
Jun 28 11:48:21 <akurtakov>	ok :)
Jun 28 11:48:21 <lufimtse>	as they can extend beyond swt, or a single run.
Jun 28 11:48:39 <lufimtse>	But I should have things up by friday I think.
Jun 28 11:48:46 <lufimtse>	at least for Win32/Cocoa tests.
Jun 28 12:14:51 <akurtakov>	nice, you start earning your position 
Jun 28 12:15:12 <akurtakov>	aka acting as the swt lead :)
Jun 28 12:17:31 <lufimtse>	X-D
Jun 28 12:17:39 <lufimtse>	you mean *started*?
Jun 28 12:18:15 <akurtakov>	yeah, speaking of your last swt-dev mail
Jun 28 12:24:22 <lufimtse>	X-D. I started going through old gerrit submissions.
Jun 28 12:24:26 <lufimtse>	maybe 1-2 a day.
Jun 28 12:24:30 <lufimtse>	lots of cocoa stuff.
Jun 28 12:24:38 <lufimtse>	that needs love.
Jun 28 12:31:38 <lufimtse>	btw, 
Jun 28 12:31:42 <lufimtse>	backport branch open now?
Jun 28 12:31:47 <akurtakov>	not yet
Jun 28 12:31:49 <akurtakov>	eow
Jun 28 12:31:52 <akurtakov>	end of week
Jun 28 12:32:04 <akurtakov>	is my estimate
Jun 28 12:32:15 <akurtakov>	merging the projects will ease releng work so much
Jun 28 12:33:20 *	akurtakov has gene through 15 repos already
Jun 28 12:34:25 <lufimtse>	I see
Jun 28 12:34:47 <lufimtse>	Btw, if we fix something now, and backport it to 4.7.1. Do we set target milestone to 4.8 m1?
Jun 28 12:34:51 <akurtakov>	and not being able to push to all of them delays every releng change way too much
Jun 28 12:35:10 <akurtakov>	reopen the bug and target 4.7.1
Jun 28 12:35:28 <lufimtse>	ok.
Jun 28 12:35:35 <akurtakov>	or if it wasn't resolved just add a comment like "keeping open for backport to 4.7.1"
Jun 28 12:36:11 *	akurtakov goes to change jdt parent poms for 4.7.1 now :)
Jun 28 12:50:49 <lufimtse>	ok
Jun 28 12:50:49 *	akurtakov :No such nick/channel
Jun 28 12:50:50 <lufimtse>	thank you
Jun 28 12:50:50 *	akurtakov :No such nick/channel
Jun 29 11:25:34 <lufimtse>	hey ya. Since about 1-2 months ago, my mylyn/gerrit integration isn't working. I get "failed to obtain repository" and other issues.
Jun 29 11:25:40 <lufimtse>	roughly after they updated gerrit.
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-116-135.ams2.redhat.com]
Jun 29 11:25:45 <akurtakov>	yeah
Jun 29 11:25:48 <lufimtse>	Do you know anything about it?
Jun 29 11:25:49 <akurtakov>	I noticed that too
Jun 29 11:25:55 <akurtakov>	moved to the web
Jun 29 11:25:57 <akurtakov>	:(
Jun 29 11:26:00 <lufimtse>	me 2.
Jun 29 11:26:07 <lufimtse>	I guess you don't know much about it?
Jun 29 11:26:55 <akurtakov>	haven't had time to investigate
Jun 29 11:27:03 <lufimtse>	ok.
Jun 29 11:27:08 <lufimtse>	I was hoping it would fix itself.
Jun 29 11:27:12 <lufimtse>	but hasn't fixed yet.
Jun 29 11:27:16 <lufimtse>	I'll submit a bug. CC u.
Jun 29 11:27:16 <akurtakov>	you may want to try egerrit
Jun 29 11:27:27 <lufimtse>	hmm
Jun 29 11:49:44 <lufimtse>	Bug 502945 – support Gerrit 2.13
Jun 29 11:50:22 <lufimtse>	Consider voting for this.
Jun 29 11:53:21 <akurtakov>	have you tried egerrit ?
Jun 29 11:56:53 <lufimtse>	I don't know how?
Jun 29 11:57:03 <lufimtse>	Let me investigate
Jun 29 11:57:11 <akurtakov>	install it from oxygen update site
Jun 29 11:57:23 <akurtakov>	it's an alternative to mylyn gerrit integration
Jun 29 11:57:26 <akurtakov>	but I haven't tried it
Jun 29 11:57:41 <akurtakov>	https://www.eclipse.org/egerrit/
Jun 29 12:03:42 *	lufimtse investigating
Jun 29 12:09:55 <lufimtse>	akurtakov HEY. It works.
Jun 29 12:10:07 <lufimtse>	kinda different from Mylyn's review mechanism
Jun 29 12:10:08 <akurtakov>	how is the workflow?
Jun 29 12:10:16 <lufimtse>	but arguably better. You can post comments
Jun 29 12:10:20 <lufimtse>	inline
Jun 29 12:10:24 <lufimtse>	kinda neat
Jun 29 12:10:34 <lufimtse>	uses quick diff as well to show differences
Jun 29 12:10:42 <akurtakov>	ok, I may try it too
Jun 29 12:10:46 <lufimtse>	Overall, it seems nice.
Jun 29 12:10:53 <lufimtse>	I can checkout patches
Jun 29 12:11:04 <lufimtse>	2 min video demo helps : https://www.eclipse.org/egerrit/
Jun 29 12:11:09 <lufimtse>	to see how it works
Jun 29 12:11:12 <lufimtse>	no sound bwt.
Jun 29 12:11:27 <lufimtse>	Note: when typing the url, you must append the 'r'
Jun 29 12:11:27 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/r
Jun 29 12:11:35 <lufimtse>	without it, it'll complain about bad version
Jun 29 12:13:54 <akurtakov>	heh
Jun 29 12:14:02 <akurtakov>	I can get used to the workflow
Jun 29 12:14:09 <akurtakov>	the UI is terrible though
Jun 29 12:15:13 <lufimtse>	meh
Jun 29 12:15:24 <lufimtse>	saves me from installing git on windows.
Jun 29 12:15:31 <lufimtse>	I think,,,
Jun 29 12:15:33 <lufimtse>	not tested.
Jun 29 12:15:42 <lufimtse>	thanks for tip. Makes life better.
Jun 29 12:15:55 <akurtakov>	you're welcome :)
Jun 29 12:16:29 <lufimtse>	Yea, I kinda never looked into it because I thought there is only mylyn gerrit review. I didn't know that there are multiple things doing the same thing.
Jun 29 12:16:37 *	lufimtse now nows that eclipse has some duplication. 
Jun 29 12:16:44 <lufimtse>	knows *
Jun 29 12:16:45 <akurtakov>	duplication is the curse of today
Jun 30 16:50:08 <lufimtse>	still around? Do you know how to build just swt and run it's tests via maven?
Jun 30 16:50:16 <lufimtse>	Le me want to automate testing

Jun 30 17:07:49 <akurtakov>	ok :)
Jun 30 17:07:50 <lufimtse>	some tests are failing, but that might not be due to maven

Sep 26 13:45:07 <akurtakov>	see how the failure is in libjavascriptcore
Sep 26 13:45:23 <akurtakov>	I start to think it's caused by some of the js functions registered by swt

Sep 28 10:01:16 <lufimtse>	hey
Sep 28 10:01:38 <lufimtse>	so Sravan said 4.7.1 is released. So I'm good to backport 4.7 patches into R4_7 master/
Sep 28 10:01:39 <lufimtse>	?
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-117-82.ams2.redhat.com]
Sep 28 10:05:50 <akurtakov>	no
Sep 28 10:06:06 <akurtakov>	R4_7 is open for 4.7.1a now
Sep 28 10:06:25 <lufimtse>	I see
Sep 28 10:06:30 <lufimtse>	wait till 1.a release
Sep 28 10:06:31 <lufimtse>	ok
Sep 28 10:08:11 <akurtakov>	I know it's confusing
Sep 28 11:54:24 <akurtakov>	webkit2 starts to chase us 
Sep 28 11:54:44 <akurtakov>	do you think having eric looking into webkit2 stuff would help?
Sep 28 11:55:48 <lufimtse>	I'm feeling it
Sep 28 11:55:51 <lufimtse>	Hmmm
Sep 28 11:57:05 <lufimtse>	Not sure...
Sep 28 11:57:44 <lufimtse>	there are 3 major tasks atm. 1) fix crash 2) implement browser return 3) ensure webkit2 doesn't call webkit1 only functions
Sep 28 11:58:04 <lufimtse>	each one kinda requires a bit of webkit2 knowledge
Sep 28 11:58:24 <lufimtse>	if things go well, it should be smoother sailing after that
Sep 28 11:58:52 <lufimtse>	implementing the browser return func is quite tricky, but it's all comming together slowly
Sep 28 11:59:16 <lufimtse>	I'm a bit concerned about how stable GDbus javascript callbacks would be..
Sep 28 11:59:22 <akurtakov>	so Eric is not there ?
Sep 28 11:59:29 <lufimtse>	Eric is on pto today
Sep 28 11:59:38 <akurtakov>	ah ok
Sep 28 11:59:39 <lufimtse>	I've been consulting with him about the crash business
Sep 28 11:59:42 <akurtakov>	what about tomorrow
Sep 28 11:59:46 <lufimtse>	he's given me some good pointers
Sep 28 12:00:05 <lufimtse>	Tomorrow he's working from home I think
Sep 28 12:00:20 <akurtakov>	ok, so let's have a chat about current status
Sep 28 12:00:28 <akurtakov>	of webkit, talks, tutorial and etc.
Sep 28 12:00:40 <lufimtse>	you mean like video conf?
Sep 28 12:00:48 <lufimtse>	Monday after meeting?
Sep 28 12:01:02 <akurtakov>	ok we can do that
Sep 28 12:01:05 <lufimtse>	ok,
Sep 28 12:01:18 <lufimtse>	for crash I have some ideas to chase for now, 
Sep 28 12:01:41 <akurtakov>	yeah, but there are a bunch of other pressing things
Sep 28 12:01:57 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Sep 28 12:02:13 <lufimtse>	you mean getting webkit2 to be default?
Sep 28 12:02:22 <lufimtse>	or swt talk
Sep 28 12:02:29 <akurtakov>	all of them :)
Sep 28 12:02:34 <lufimtse>	X-D
Sep 28 12:44:00 <lufimtse>	does bugzilla work for you?
Sep 28 14:25:26 <akurtakov>	so how does it look now
Sep 28 14:25:29 <akurtakov>	have you tried it ?
Sep 28 14:46:52 <lufimtse>	bugzilla works
Sep 28 14:46:52 *	akurtakov :No such nick/channel
Sep 29 12:05:05 <lufimtse>	Good observation on missing jUnit, I've had the same thought: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/106023
Sep 29 12:05:36 <lufimtse>	It comes down to me not having considered that corner case, the fix is fairly simply thou.
Sep 29 12:05:44 <lufimtse>	simple*
[akurtakov has address ~akurtakov@ovpn-116-241.ams2.redhat.com]
Sep 29 12:17:02 <akurtakov>	cool
Sep 29 12:17:15 <akurtakov>	please contact Mat if the fix is good
Sep 29 12:17:26 <akurtakov>	so this is backported to rhscl
Sep 29 12:17:29 <akurtakov>	and fedora
Sep 29 12:18:10 <lufimtse>	I should have merged later today. The only thing is that I'm having a hard time verifying it. The JBoss central for some reason doesn't load in my child eclipse
Sep 29 12:18:21 <akurtakov>	missing deps ?
Sep 29 12:18:42 <lufimtse>	maybe.. hmmm. 
Sep 29 12:19:19 <akurtakov>	friday evening so "beer o'clock"
Sep 29 12:19:24 <akurtakov>	enjoy your weekend
Sep 29 12:19:28 <lufimtse>	:-)
