Feb 16 15:11:16 <chkoehle>	almac how does one go about hosting a bot for this channel
Feb 16 15:11:23 <chkoehle>	is it run on s01.yyz....?
Feb 16 15:11:33 <chkoehle>	s/run/hosted
Feb 16 15:12:18 <almac>	i actually don't know
Feb 16 15:12:28 <chkoehle>	i wonder where thermostat-bot is hosted
Feb 16 15:12:34 <almac>	it'd be like vilebot
Feb 16 15:12:44 <almac>	thermostat-bot lives on jmatsuok's computer
Feb 16 15:12:54 <almac>	used to be hosted by omair
Feb 16 15:15:26 <chkoehle>	i might make something over the weekend
Feb 16 15:15:41 <chkoehle>	some simple bot that can get data and notify people and scrape elo
Feb 16 15:15:51 <chkoehle>	(unless someone else wants to)
Feb 16 15:17:20 <chkoehle>	i also assume the url is:
Feb 16 15:17:34 <chkoehle>	rht_<month-3-letters>-<1 or 2>-2018
Feb 16 15:17:41 <almac>	yup that'd be it
Feb 16 15:17:46 <chkoehle>	underscores... 
Feb 16 15:17:56 <chkoehle>	evil
Feb 16 15:18:00 <chkoehle>	just kidding
Feb 16 15:18:07 <almac>	wooo underscores
Feb 16 15:22:57 <cchianel>	Test
Feb 16 15:23:22 <hukhan>	you should add features like !challenge chkoehle 
Feb 16 15:23:32 <almac>	grudge match
Feb 16 15:23:48 <hukhan>	maybe like an optional message
Feb 16 15:23:54 <chkoehle>	can that count for elo?
Feb 16 15:23:56 <hukhan>	.!challenge chkoehle "don't be a wuss"
Feb 16 15:24:32 <almac>	hm .. i don't see why not as long as it's a consenting ranked-type match
Feb 16 15:24:43 <cchianel_>	Test
Feb 16 15:24:47 <hukhan>	fail
Feb 16 15:24:49 <cchianel_>	Okay, added login command
Feb 16 15:25:17 <hukhan>	oh you know what 
Feb 16 15:25:43 <hukhan>	give an option to make it ranked as well
Feb 16 15:25:49 <hukhan>	or is that too many options
Feb 16 15:25:50 <hukhan>	lol
Feb 16 15:25:55 <chkoehle>	there is no such thing as too many options
Feb 16 15:26:09 <hukhan>	!challenge chkoehle "don't be a wuss" -r
Feb 16 15:26:10 <chkoehle>	however idk how that'd play with almac 's elo system
Feb 16 15:26:16 <chkoehle>	ooh recursive
Feb 16 15:26:16 <cchianel>	chkoehle, add an option to play against skynet
Feb 16 15:26:20 <almac>	i'll be looking to migrate that soon
Feb 16 15:26:22 <chkoehle>	i dont want to get to 0 elo
Feb 16 15:26:25 <almac>	soon(tm)
Feb 16 15:26:38 <almac>	and based on how busy/lazy i get when i go home
Feb 16 15:26:56 <hukhan>	this would actually be kinda fun
Feb 16 15:27:19 <chkoehle>	where the hell is lbullen
Feb 16 15:27:23 <chkoehle>	and jpinkney especially
Feb 16 15:27:26 <hukhan>	he went home
Feb 16 15:27:31 <hukhan>	jpinkney never left home
Feb 16 15:27:43 <chkoehle>	we have to convert every intern to smash
Feb 16 15:27:48 <chkoehle>	newtern*
Feb 16 15:28:01 <chkoehle>	100%
Feb 16 15:28:49 <almac>	of course
Feb 16 15:28:53 <almac>	it's a first day activity
Feb 16 15:29:00 <almac>	we throw them into a bracket and judge them
Feb 16 15:29:24 <almac>	LOL that's how they should do team rankings ..
Feb 16 15:29:31 <chkoehle>	yes ^
Feb 16 15:31:33 <rubao>	yes ^
Feb 16 15:31:40 *	rubao looks at log
Feb 16 15:32:07 <hukhan>	can we sit in the back couches with numbered sign, and rate them like on their performance by lifting up said numbered signs
Feb 16 15:33:03 <almac>	with pizza
Feb 16 15:33:32 <chkoehle>	rofl
Feb 16 15:40:56 <chkoehle>	almac does challonge have built in elo to assign matches or did you handcraft them? i forget
Feb 16 15:41:05 <chkoehle>	by handcraft i mean took your elo offlin calcs
Feb 16 15:41:06 <almac>	it doesn't
Feb 16 15:41:07 <chkoehle>	and applied them
Feb 16 15:41:28 <almac>	i'm using a repo i found on github deployed on heroku atm

Feb 21 12:44:58 <chkoehle>	jpinkney lufimtse you guys should play your game today since you'd be surprised how many branches on the challonge thing it blocks (directly and indirectly)
Feb 21 12:45:01 <chkoehle>	or soon
Feb 21 12:45:06 <chkoehle>	ha i need my TM characters, 1 sec
Feb 21 12:45:16 <chkoehle>	Soon™
Feb 21 12:45:19 <chkoehle>	there we go :D
Feb 21 12:47:31 <almac|wfh>	technically i think there's enough people in the office s.t we could finish the bracket up until winners & losers finals
Feb 21 12:48:48 <jpinkney>	We are going to play today
Feb 21 12:49:35 <chkoehle>	if you guys play before 2:30 then whoever loses could play cchianel|lunch and then the winner of that can play me
Feb 21 12:49:39 <chkoehle>	see, look at how selfish i am
Feb 21 12:50:14 <chkoehle>	it would also allow a hukhan vs someone game to happen and open up the top bracket too, maybe i'm just an idealist at this point heh
Feb 21 12:50:42 <jpinkney>	lufimtse I'm down to play whenever, i'm back from lunch
Feb 21 13:51:52 <chkoehle>	jpinkney it is time
Feb 21 13:52:59 <hukhan>	we can get 5/10/11 done today
Feb 21 14:40:47 <lufimtse>	hukhan, wanna play after work?
Feb 21 14:40:55 <hukhan>	lufimtse: yis sir
Feb 21 14:41:28 <lufimtse>	hukhan, okhay. Maybe we should all just burn through the tournament at 5pm
Feb 21 14:41:28 <lufimtse>	ha ha
Feb 21 14:41:40 <lufimtse>	I'm still waiting for Tom from first tournament.
Feb 21 14:41:45 <lufimtse>	Jo, we need to get more people involved.
Feb 21 14:41:46 <hukhan>	if people show up - it's totally possible
Feb 21 14:41:57 <lufimtse>	like the new debugger guy 
Feb 21 14:42:30 <almac|wfh>	lufimtse, that first one is never gonna finish
Feb 21 14:42:35 <almac|wfh>	we aint seeing tom for a while
Feb 21 14:42:47 <almac|wfh>	(now that ive said it, he'll be in tomorrow? jynxed)
Feb 21 14:42:49 <hukhan>	he did mention to let him know when his match is pending
Feb 21 14:42:55 <almac|wfh>	wait really
Feb 21 14:42:58 <almac|wfh>	boo
Feb 21 14:43:01 <hukhan>	yeah lol
Feb 21 14:43:22 <almac|wfh>	see if we can get him in on a consistent basis, then it'll be easier than cramming the entire bracket into a day
Feb 21 14:43:33 <almac|wfh>	but we're still interested in a doubles bracket for the upcoming one right?
Feb 21 14:43:49 <hukhan>	yeaah - but do we have the people?
Feb 21 14:45:59 <almac|wfh>	all we need is an even number of people
Feb 21 14:46:17 <almac|wfh>	it's not going to be as large, but coordinating 4-player matches will require more time potentially
Feb 21 14:49:09 <chkoehle>	<lufimtse> like the new debugger guy
Feb 21 14:49:15 <chkoehle>	do you know how much C++ he knows
Feb 21 14:49:25 <lufimtse>	chkoehle, probably a lot.
Feb 21 14:49:36 <lufimtse>	chkoehle, I'm gonna guess he is new God of C++ in office.
Feb 21 14:49:39 <chkoehle>	GOOD... good...
Feb 21 14:49:46 <chkoehle>	<insert prequel meme here>
Feb 21 14:50:29 <chkoehle>	i was hoping thered be someone who could shed some light on some of the more insane crap in C++
Feb 21 14:50:42 <chkoehle>	idk how much you've used it

Feb 27 13:10:15 <almac>	the bracket is ready, but I can't set more than one e-mail address per pair, so let me know if you want to volunteer your challonge account to be linked for your team
Feb 27 13:11:06 <almac>	first games are: almac & rubao vs. lbullen & jpinkney, and lufimtse & clessard vs. hukhan & cchianel  
Feb 27 13:11:31 <cchianel>	XD TEAM EAP UNITE!
Feb 27 13:11:59 <almac>	the bracket is smaller so that (should in theory ..) give us more time to finish games
Feb 27 13:12:13 <almac>	just a note that the rules are a tad different, doubles are 3-stock 8 minute timer
Feb 27 13:14:35 <hukhan>	cchianel: we will rock them
Feb 27 14:04:52 <lufimtse>	hukhan and cchianel will missile/arrow people to their death ha ha
Feb 27 14:05:12 <lufimtse>	they need to figure out a way to stand on top of each other and just fire trajectories

Feb 27 14:08:46 <almac>	hukhan, there are some tweaks you can make to your online settings on the wiiu to try and get a more stable connection
Feb 27 14:08:51 <almac>	and router settings too
Feb 27 14:09:06 <hukhan>	aside from forwarding ports?
Feb 27 14:09:17 <almac>	some DNS setting or something
Feb 27 14:09:24 <hukhan>	hmm, will take a look, thanks
Feb 27 14:09:25 <almac>	network mumbo jumbo i have no idea
Feb 27 14:09:31 <almac>	but i followed some guys youtube video
Feb 27 14:09:41 <hukhan>	did you notice a signifcant difference?
Feb 27 14:09:45 <almac>	well,
Feb 27 14:09:47 <almac>	a bit
Feb 27 14:09:56 <almac>	BUT the router i was using was like 3+ years old
Feb 27 14:10:00 <almac>	so i replaced it on boxing day
Feb 27 14:10:03 <hukhan>	I played against a falcon, and he was dancing around me and I felt like I was playing a picfture book, it was furstrating
Feb 27 14:10:07 <almac>	and now it's really good
Feb 27 14:10:18 <hukhan>	hmmm all right
Feb 27 14:10:24 <almac>	yeah I usually just kill myself if the lag is too bad
Feb 27 14:10:39 <almac>	eventually ill find someone with a pretty decent connection, and hope we can play for a while
Feb 27 14:14:18 <almac>	hukhan, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9mb77Gr86o
Feb 27 14:14:20 <almac>	is the jist of it
Feb 27 14:14:24 <almac>	not sure if it's legit or placebo
Feb 27 14:14:39 <hukhan>	LOL 
Feb 27 14:14:48 <hukhan>	okay I'll play a few matches and then try this out and compare
Mar 01 11:40:30 <almac>	anyone have time for games today? jpinkney & lbullen? i guess gotta figure out what time works for rubao too 
Mar 01 11:41:06 <lbullen>	so down
Mar 01 11:41:57 <lbullen>	jpinkney, should we quit our jobs to get more time to practice our sweet team combos?
Mar 01 11:42:41 <almac>	lbullen, things to study: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nOJWuy5Bdo
Mar 01 11:43:59 <almac>	also lbullen, starting at around 0:13 is a good application of what footstools can be used for: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuDLo-H_W8o
Mar 01 11:45:03 <lbullen>	that hurts to watch, so good
Mar 01 11:47:24 <jpinkney>	lbullen yes
Mar 01 11:52:06 <rubao>	:o
Mar 01 11:52:11 <rubao>	skills++
Mar 01 11:56:16 <lbullen>	rumble in the jungle @noon?
Mar 01 11:57:47 <almac>	sounds good to me
Mar 01 12:45:18 <lbullen>	...duel...?
Mar 01 12:45:36 <almac>	suuuuure
Mar 01 12:48:34 <cchianel>	(doesn't happen)
Mar 01 12:55:49 <almac>	:(
Mar 02 09:27:06 <hukhan>	almac: I watched something on how to use SDI's to escape bayo's witch twist combos 
Mar 02 09:27:16 <almac>	from the BeefySmashDoods?
Mar 02 09:27:25 <hukhan>	I don't remember 
Mar 02 09:27:27 <hukhan>	lol
Mar 02 09:27:27 <almac>	they make really sick tech videos btw
Mar 02 09:27:29 <hukhan>	it was on their subreddit
Mar 02 09:27:35 <hukhan>	last night
Mar 02 09:27:37 <almac>	was it narrated by a guy with a nice voice?
Mar 02 09:27:41 <hukhan>	yes
Mar 02 09:27:43 <almac>	kind of deep, bit of an accent
Mar 02 09:27:46 <almac>	yeah lol beefysmashdoods
Mar 02 09:27:48 <almac>	great stuff
Mar 02 09:27:53 <almac>	bayonetta is nuts
Mar 02 09:27:53 <hukhan>	yeahh
Mar 02 09:28:03 <almac>	you gotta SDI the heck out of your controller
Mar 02 09:28:12 <hukhan>	I want to try it out with you if you got the time today
Mar 02 09:28:14 <hukhan>	lol
Mar 02 09:28:17 <almac>	of course
Mar 02 09:28:45 <hukhan>	one thing he didn't mention was, do you have to SDI as soon as you get hit, or can you start maching your joystick before it happens
Mar 02 09:28:55 <hukhan>	mashing*
Mar 02 09:29:37 <almac>	you can start anytime and it helps
Mar 02 09:29:43 <almac>	but to get out of it you need to start asap
Mar 02 09:29:46 <hukhan>	nice
Mar 02 09:29:47 <almac>	hukhan, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUm_ayyLb0
Mar 02 09:29:51 <almac>	check at like 0:15 seconds
Mar 02 09:30:06 <almac>	Tweek, Keitaro and Cosmos made like an hour long video of how to get out of bayo's combos
Mar 02 09:30:14 <hukhan>	oh sweet
Mar 02 09:30:17 <almac>	BeefySmashDoods did like the tl:dr version of it lol
Mar 02 09:30:24 <almac>	but 0:15 to 0:30 is pretty jokes
Mar 02 09:30:50 <almac>	for context the emo looking guy on the left is possibly the best cloud/bayo player in the world, and the guy on the right is a popular commentator
Mar 02 09:31:02 <almac>	but pretty darn funny, you can actually get out of witch twist up
Mar 02 09:31:05 <hukhan>	LOL 
Mar 02 09:31:09 <hukhan>	"how did you go so high"
Mar 02 09:31:19 <almac>	lol it's a pretty jokes video
Mar 02 09:31:33 <hukhan>	did he SDI up away from bayo there?
Mar 02 09:32:02 <almac>	yeah, they later go on to describe how to get out of her side twists assuming you don't sdi off the top
Mar 02 09:32:09 <hukhan>	yeah
Mar 02 09:32:11 <almac>	because you need to be reallllllly fast at mashing your analog
Mar 02 09:32:24 <almac>	it's really likely you should just set up to get out of the second combo instead
Mar 02 09:32:56 <almac>	but also if you regular DI down away after first twist (assuming you don't SDI) i believe you can fall out of some of her side follow-up combos
Mar 02 09:33:12 <almac>	so its pretty much a mind game when playing against a bayo
Mar 02 10:20:19 <hukhan>	oof why is she so complicated
Mar 02 10:20:21 <hukhan>	lol
Mar 02 10:26:20 <almac>	cause nintendo wants your $5.99
Mar 02 10:26:42 <almac>	she used to be more broken, she's actually been nerfed (if you can believe it)
Mar 02 10:38:08 <hukhan>	yeah I saw that
Mar 02 10:38:09 <hukhan>	insane
Mar 02 14:52:58 <hukhan>	yooooo
Mar 02 14:53:03 <hukhan>	friday night smash!?!?

Mar 02 14:54:35 <almac>	won't last more than an hour
Mar 02 14:54:36 <hukhan>	I can't handle that many shots
Mar 02 14:54:41 <almac>	**5 minutes

Mar 08 11:43:13 <almac>	if anyone hears me yelling around 3pm today, it's cause smash got announced
Mar 08 11:43:18 <almac>	otherwise im gonna be sad this evening
Mar 08 11:49:11 <rubao>	wot
Mar 08 11:49:23 *	rubao will be more excited if pokemon got announced :p
Mar 08 11:49:31 <almac>	that'd be pretty hype too
Mar 08 11:49:32 <rubao>	or labo#2
Mar 08 11:49:40 <rubao>	labo ultimate
Mar 08 11:49:46 <almac>	labo plastic

Mar 08 11:50:04 <rubao>	labo C++/JAVA/PYTHON :p
Mar 08 11:50:06 <almac>	basically a gundam
Mar 08 11:50:40 <rubao>	almac++
Mar 08 12:24:47 <hukhan>	almac: is there any reason to suggest a new smash will be announced? 
Mar 08 12:25:06 <almac>	gather round children, it's story time
Mar 08 12:25:12 <cchianel>	hukhan, yes: cause smash is awesome
Mar 08 12:25:21 <hukhan>	-_-
Mar 08 12:25:34 <almac>	well, its been 5 years since last smash was annoucned, which is similar time between brawl -> 4
Mar 08 12:25:56 <almac>	last year there was a patch to update the wii u smash 4 for the cloud/corrin/bayonetta amiibos that had just come out
Mar 08 12:26:19 <almac>	in the code for the patch, it was found they had reverted some of the status codes back to what they were like in dev mode
Mar 08 12:26:29 <almac>	but it was toggled off previously or something
Mar 08 12:26:42 <almac>	so evidence that smash 4 went from final prod -> development
Mar 08 12:27:09 <hukhan>	hmm
Mar 08 12:27:25 <almac>	i guess also speculation due to the popularity of the mario kart ports
Mar 08 12:27:31 <hukhan>	yeah 
Mar 08 12:27:33 <almac>	they couldn't have annoucned smash last year, because of ARMS
Mar 08 12:27:37 <hukhan>	even if its a port
Mar 08 12:27:40 <hukhan>	I'd consider getting a switch 
Mar 08 12:27:42 <hukhan>	lol
Mar 08 12:27:48 <almac>	they wouldn't deliberately kill their newest IP with smash they'd be nuts
Mar 08 12:29:09 <almac>	e3 is more realistic, but im tired of waiting T.T
Mar 08 12:30:41 <hukhan>	if it's a new smash and they drop toon link, I'm quitting
Mar 08 12:33:13 <lbullen>	hukhan got those priorities straight
Mar 08 12:42:21 <hukhan>	lufimtse, cchianel, are you guys available to do the 2v2?
Mar 08 12:42:34 <cchianel>	hukhan, yes
Mar 08 12:42:47 <hukhan>	kk so if lufimtse is available, we can do it now
Mar 08 12:42:49 <lufimtse>	hukhan,  5pm?
Mar 08 12:43:01 <lufimtse>	hukhan, or I could do a quick one
Mar 08 12:43:01 <lufimtse>	now
Mar 08 12:43:10 <hukhan>	yeah that would be better (if you can)
Mar 08 12:43:14 <hukhan>	cchianel: leaves early
Mar 08 12:43:14 <lufimtse>	ok,
Mar 08 12:43:15 <lufimtse>	now?
Mar 08 12:43:17 <hukhan>	ya
Mar 08 12:59:06 <almac>	damn those were hype
Mar 08 12:59:18 <almac>	lbullen & jpinkney vs. lufimtse & clessard
Mar 08 12:59:32 <cchianel>	2-0 hukhan and cchianel 
Mar 08 12:59:38 <almac>	almac & rubao vs. cchianel & hukhan 
Mar 08 12:59:42 <almac>	are the next ones
Mar 08 13:00:11 <hukhan>	2s are intense
Mar 08 13:00:20 <rubao>	:o
Mar 08 13:00:31 <rubao>	i am mentally ready for the match
Mar 08 13:02:06 <lbullen>	lufimtse jpinkney match at 5?
Mar 08 13:03:49 <almac>	2s are a different beast
Mar 08 13:03:57 <almac>	playing the 2v1 is pretty exhausting
Mar 08 13:04:29 <almac>	rubao, we going double cloud again?
Mar 08 13:04:39 <rubao>	sure
Mar 08 13:04:47 <rubao>	up B 
Mar 08 13:04:49 <rubao>	for entire match
Mar 08 13:04:53 <rubao>	until one falls 
Mar 08 13:04:59 <rubao>	:D
Mar 08 13:05:11 *	rubao secretly reveals this evil strategy
Mar 08 13:05:32 <almac>	and then adapts to not use that strategy so they think we're running this strategy but really its just a long con
Mar 08 13:05:46 <rubao>	lol
Mar 08 13:05:48 <rubao>	almac++
Mar 08 13:09:50 <rubao>	almac: ready for playnig?
Mar 08 13:09:56 <rubao>	s/playnig/playing
Mar 08 13:10:04 <almac>	yeah sure
Mar 08 13:25:14 <hukhan>	almac|lunch: I need to play your cloud more >:|
Mar 08 13:25:22 <hukhan>	are you gonna play @5
Mar 08 13:25:25 <hukhan>	after their game
Mar 08 13:25:42 <almac|lunch>	hukhan, did your wifi get any better?
Mar 08 13:25:49 <almac|lunch>	add 'ayymac' on wii u
Mar 08 13:26:15 <almac|lunch>	but can likely stay after 5 today to play some
Mar 08 13:26:20 <hukhan>	haven't had time to try it out yet, but I'll note it down
Mar 08 13:26:23 <hukhan>	kk
Mar 08 13:26:25 <hukhan>	sweet
Mar 08 13:26:46 <hukhan>	also lol@name
Mar 08 13:27:04 <almac|lunch>	yeah i can't change my wiiu name, that used to be my gamer tag at tournaments
Mar 08 13:27:32 <almac|lunch>	but one of the best players from like manitoba or saskatechewawn goes by the name 'amac', so they thought i was memeing him or some guy actually thought i was him once
Mar 08 13:28:27 <hukhan>	hahahaha
Mar 08 14:29:54 <lufimtse>	lbullen, 5 could work
Mar 08 14:33:59 <almac>	wooo and doubles continues
Mar 08 15:09:01 <hukhan>	almac: 
Mar 08 15:09:05 <hukhan>	what's the news
Mar 08 15:09:09 <almac>	the news is
Mar 08 15:09:12 <almac>	that i was SO hyped
Mar 08 15:09:16 <almac>	i messed up the time conversion
Mar 08 15:09:20 <almac>	in a way that doesn't make sense
Mar 08 15:09:21 <hukhan>	:(
Mar 08 15:09:23 <almac>	it starts at 5 EST
Mar 08 15:09:28 <hukhan>	poop
Mar 08 15:09:41 <hukhan>	okay so we celebrate with smash if it's a new smash
Mar 08 15:09:48 <almac>	5 EST .. which is 2 PST. Because of math, 5 - 2 is 3, so it's on at 3 EST instead
Mar 08 15:09:53 <hukhan>	or, we cheer ourselves up with some smash if it's not a new smash
Mar 08 15:10:13 <almac>	that's the spirit
Mar 08 15:10:20 <almac>	so i have twitch open, some of the chat is pretty fun
Mar 08 15:10:50 <hukhan>	what are they saying?
Mar 08 15:10:56 <almac>	typical twitch chat
Mar 08 15:11:01 <almac>	it's a toxic wasteland
Mar 08 15:11:10 <almac>	of memes and broken dreams
Mar 08 15:11:54 <hukhan>	-__-
Mar 08 16:47:34 <almac>	hukhan, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQlYM-kFsjw
Mar 08 16:48:00 <almac>	that first combo they do on sheik works even better on heavy fast-fallers e.g., cloud, falcon, etc.
Mar 08 16:48:18 <almac>	if done right its an easy 60% to start the game
Mar 08 17:05:02 <rubao>	:o
Mar 08 17:05:05 <rubao>	nitendo
Mar 08 17:05:09 <rubao>	nitendo direct
Mar 08 17:06:06 <rubao>	nitendo switch
Mar 08 17:06:22 *	rubao hopes
Mar 08 17:07:44 <almac>	this direct is hype
Mar 08 17:09:23 <rubao>	lol sushi striker
Mar 08 17:09:39 *	rubao haven't seen most of the games

Mar 08 17:14:54 *	rubao is slightly ashamed of himself as a player
Mar 08 17:16:35 <rubao>	:o, the tennis seemed kinda fun
Mar 08 17:16:41 <rubao>	with the trailer
Mar 08 17:17:19 <almac>	it does look pretty good, the tennis games are fun
Mar 08 17:18:15 <rubao>	if it is multiplayerable /or online matchable 
Mar 08 17:18:23 <rubao>	I probbaly will buy it lol
Mar 08 17:18:38 *	rubao still misses the old memories from wii motion controls

Mar 09 09:54:45 <almac>	nah it was just a lame commercial for splatoon
Mar 09 12:01:07 <lufimtse>	watch reactions of fans who find out smash is comming to Switch:  https://youtu.be/vY1qHWrumBQ?t=36
Mar 09 12:05:10 <almac>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DseTHfk8RxA at around 1:32 is the best reaction i've seen yet
Mar 09 12:07:38 <almac>	lufimtse, that one is awesome, at an official nintendo store
Mar 09 12:07:58 <almac>	there's a pretty good one i saw from a tournament in germany, everyone just stops and you hear screaming in the background
Mar 09 12:08:11 <almac>	i may or may not have been watching reaction vids all night yesterday
Mar 09 12:08:31 <cchianel>	*cries as I don't have a Switch*
Mar 09 12:08:51 <lbullen>	"welcome to darksouls" XD
Mar 09 12:09:02 <almac>	nintendo would be nuts to not release this around christmas time, you've got a long time
Mar 09 12:14:35 <cchianel>	but then the oldterns won't get to play it on the office switch...

Mar 13 10:37:21 <almac>	PSA: doubles could continue today, we need hukhan & cchianel vs. lufimtse & clessard 
Mar 13 10:37:36 <lufimtse>	almac, I'm away at lunch. You guys wanna meet at 5pm?
Mar 13 10:37:41 <hukhan>	sure
Mar 13 10:37:43 <almac>	additionally there's a new singles bracket posted in the info bar at the top, everyone has matches to do
Mar 13 10:38:18 <almac>	ehh cchianel leaves in the mid afternoon, that match could be a bit difficult to do at 5
Mar 13 10:38:31 <hukhan>	wait
Mar 13 10:38:33 <hukhan>	we can't do it at 5 
Mar 13 10:38:43 <hukhan>	cchianel: leaves ~2
Mar 13 10:39:02 <hukhan>	or what almac just said 
Mar 13 10:39:08 <hukhan>	I don't read
Mar 13 10:39:09 <almac>	hm then put that one off another day or two, and prioritize the singles bracket
Mar 13 10:39:34 <hukhan>	kk
Mar 13 10:39:41 <almac>	hukhan vs. lbullen 
Mar 13 10:39:43 <lbullen>	@hukhan, YOU ARE GOING DOWN!!! 1v1. irl. rust. quick scopes only.
Mar 13 10:39:59 <hukhan>	wat
Mar 13 10:39:59 <almac>	jeez that was so fast i thought it was an automated response
Mar 13 10:40:03 <hukhan>	YEAH ME TOO
Mar 13 10:40:25 <almac>	lbullen has a bot that just prints "$_, YOU ARE GOING DOWN!!! 1v1. irl. rust. quick scopes only."
Mar 13 10:40:31 <hukhan>	LOL
Mar 13 10:40:33 <almac>	hukhan vs. lbullen 
Mar 13 10:40:38 <almac>	smashbot--
Mar 13 10:40:56 <hukhan>	wasn't chkoehle supposed to be making a bot 
Mar 13 10:41:02 <almac>	rip the dream
Mar 13 10:41:26 <almac>	i keep saying ill work on something, then i get home, stuff happens, 11pm rolls around and i don't feel like writing code
Mar 13 10:41:43 <almac>	but i would like to set up at least an @all command this week
Mar 13 10:42:40 <hukhan>	ask cchianel
Mar 13 10:42:46 <hukhan>	he just codes all the time 
Mar 13 10:42:57 <almac>	anywho, back on the games list .. we have cchianel vs. lufimtse (probably not today)
Mar 13 10:42:57 <hukhan>	he probably codes in his sleep
Mar 13 10:43:21 <almac>	and jpinkney vs chkoelhe whenever he comes back
Mar 13 10:44:40 <almac>	dang i can't imagine coding in sleep
Mar 13 10:44:52 <almac>	i played so much tetris once that i dreamed about tetris pieces falling
Mar 13 10:44:56 <almac>	2spooky4me
Mar 13 10:45:17 <hukhan>	have you seen the college humor tetris video
Mar 13 10:45:21 <hukhan>	it's great
Mar 13 10:45:30 <almac>	i don't believe i have
Mar 13 10:45:38 <almac>	but college humour isn't something ive heard of in a long time
Mar 13 10:46:16 <hukhan>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Alw5hs0chj0
Mar 13 11:04:23 <cchianel>	almac, that reminds me when I wrote Tetris cause I didn't like the version I played
Mar 13 11:04:31 <almac_>	cchianel, u wot
Mar 13 14:06:38 <almac>	in addition to all the other matches that could happen, chkoehle vs. jpinkney can happen too
Mar 13 14:11:54 <chkoehle>	jpinkney if we have to play a game, my body is ready
Mar 13 15:50:46 <hukhan>	almac: btw lbullen and I had our match 
Mar 13 15:50:50 <hukhan>	2-0, hukhan
Mar 13 15:51:21 <almac>	hukhan, great thanks

Mar 13 17:13:53 <almac>	in my dreams
Mar 13 17:20:33 <rubao|laptop>	#todo create a smashbot that may possibly generate smash tourneys
Mar 14 10:38:08 <chkoehle>	jpinkney if you wanted to play today let me know
Mar 14 14:32:33 <chkoehle>	almac can you advance me 2-0 in the tourney
Mar 14 14:33:17 <almac>	you guys did your match?
Mar 14 14:34:12 <chkoehle>	we played today, though IIRC jpinkney said after today he's too swamped with work to be able to continue for this tourney
Mar 14 14:34:30 <chkoehle>	though may want to double confirm with him
Mar 14 14:34:59 <jpinkney>	Confirmed
Mar 14 14:35:12 <jpinkney>	I think I'll just stick with doubles, they're more fun for me imo
Mar 14 14:35:14 <almac>	alright ty
Mar 14 14:35:25 <jpinkney>	and they happen less frequently so its easier
Mar 14 14:35:33 <almac>	we still need lufimtse vs. cchianel at some point, and clessard vs. rubao
Mar 14 14:35:46 <chkoehle>	wtf my login password is wrong
Mar 14 14:35:50 <almac>	sure lol we still have to wrap up that doubles bracket
Mar 14 14:35:58 <chkoehle>	i wonder if that actually pings
Mar 14 14:36:07 <almac>	it doesn't
Mar 14 14:36:08 <chkoehle>	who is left in the doubles bracket, lets see
Mar 14 14:36:12 <almac>	but feel free to poke them
Mar 14 14:36:26 <chkoehle>	where is rubao
Mar 14 14:36:36 <almac>	we need team eap to play leo & christian
Mar 14 14:37:32 <hukhan>	I think leo has been to obusy to play before cchianel leaves 
Mar 14 14:38:00 <hukhan>	so might have to wait until his schedule opens up
Mar 14 14:38:11 <chkoehle>	they should lunch battle
Mar 14 14:38:29 <chkoehle>	rubao you should anger-duel clessard soon
Mar 14 14:38:34 <chkoehle>	revenge
Mar 14 14:38:40 <rubao>	ah right
Mar 14 14:38:50 <rubao>	yea.. was in a meeting rn
Mar 14 14:39:09 <rubao>	will let clessard know when i am ready :)
Mar 14 14:39:17 <chkoehle>	dont worry you dont have to do it immediately 
Mar 14 14:39:30 <chkoehle>	but i may need a bubble tea immediately
Mar 15 09:42:00 *	Disconnected (Invalid argument)

Mar 15 15:17:01 <hukhan>	anyone playing at 5?
Mar 15 16:56:30 <almac>	6?
Mar 15 16:56:33 <almac>	:D
Mar 15 16:56:44 <almac>	i slept in too much this morning
Mar 15 16:57:15 <almac>	i'm trying to power through dragon ball super so I can watch the last episode on march 18th, think i watched like 10 episodes last night >.<
Mar 15 16:57:23 <hukhan>	waaa
Mar 15 16:57:26 <hukhan>	how is super
Mar 15 16:57:30 <almac>	freaking sick
Mar 15 16:57:34 <hukhan>	really?? 
Mar 15 16:57:38 <hukhan>	hmm I should check it out 
Mar 15 16:57:52 <almac>	well, the first 30-40 episodes are basically the two movies
Mar 15 16:57:54 <hukhan>	do they fix the pacing
Mar 15 16:58:00 <almac>	battle of the gods and ressurection f
Mar 15 16:58:06 <hukhan>	I saw battle of the gods
Mar 15 16:58:17 <almac>	then a neat little arc for a tournament, then the goku black arc holy moly was so good
Mar 15 16:58:21 <almac>	it got pretty dark for a bit
Mar 15 16:58:35 <almac>	the pacing is overall pretty good, there's not a ton of 'filler' episodes like the old dbz
Mar 15 16:58:50 <almac>	which is nice
Mar 15 16:58:50 <hukhan>	hmmm I might take a look
Mar 15 16:59:05 <hukhan>	yeah I heard good things about dbz kai since they killed the filler 
Mar 15 16:59:11 <hukhan>	but they made it more pg - which is a bit of a downer
Mar 15 16:59:11 <almac>	yeah that was much better
Mar 15 16:59:29 <almac>	although, the episode in dbz where goku and piccolo learn to drive is one of my favourites because it's so dumb
Mar 15 16:59:40 <hukhan>	LOL I think I remember that 
Mar 15 16:59:50 <almac>	weirdest filler episode ever
Mar 15 16:59:51 <hukhan>	gohan in highschool was also great
Mar 15 16:59:57 <almac>	lol yeah
Mar 15 17:00:01 <hukhan>	or was it college I can't remember
Mar 15 17:00:09 <almac>	he tries to play baseball and just kills it
Mar 15 17:00:17 <almac>	the great saiyaman
Mar 15 17:00:19 <hukhan>	hahaha
Mar 15 17:00:21 <hukhan>	yea
Mar 15 17:00:27 <hukhan>	I love that he's the only one who thinks his outfit looks cool 
Mar 15 17:00:37 <almac>	lol yeah
Mar 15 17:00:56 <hukhan>	have you seen trunk's movie
Mar 15 17:01:07 <almac>	but for super you could probably just watch the two movies and start at like episode 35 or whatever, the pacing is a bit slow on the early ones so that may be a good way to approach it
Mar 15 17:01:10 <hukhan>	that movie has like the best gohan 
Mar 15 17:01:12 <almac>	i think a bit a long time ago
Mar 15 17:01:22 <almac>	with future trunks and gohan with one arm
Mar 15 17:01:26 <hukhan>	yeaaah
Mar 15 17:02:01 <hukhan>	there's a sick live action rendition of that movie online
Mar 15 17:02:33 <almac>	will have to take a look
Mar 15 17:02:44 <hukhan>	kk
Mar 15 17:02:52 <almac>	i don't think i've seen the words 'sick' and 'live action' together in the same sentence when referring to dbz
Mar 15 17:03:20 <hukhan>	haha, it's a good attempt by fans imo

Mar 16 10:37:14 <chkoehle>	i am ready for any time
Mar 16 10:37:20 <almac>	Otherwise hopefully pick it up next monday

Mar 16 10:42:08 <chkoehle>	monday it is
Mar 16 10:42:41 <rubao>	makes sense

Mar 16 10:43:08 *	rubao kidding
Mar 16 10:43:16 <chkoehle>	i like that style of thinking
Mar 16 10:44:18 <rubao>	in the future, it might even be possible to hire a robot who can do exact same moves in game 4 u 
Mar 16 10:44:30 <rubao>	but /me hopes it will not happen that soon
Mar 16 10:45:27 <cchianel>	rubao, are you should it didn't already happen, and we all exist in the mind of our robot overload?
Mar 16 10:45:34 <almac>	oh yeah, my Cpt. Falcon amiibo came in yesterday
Mar 16 10:45:49 <almac>	I should train it up this weekend, then when im gone for two weeks you can use that for my matches
Mar 16 10:47:19 <rubao>	cchianel|lunch: that might be true, the entire world can be a huge computer, and each small person might be a small program
Mar 16 10:47:22 <rubao>	almac++

Mar 16 10:54:04 <chkoehle>	hey you did CSC411
Mar 16 10:54:08 <chkoehle>	make a neural net!!!
Mar 16 10:54:12 <hukhan>	if you train an ai based on 1000+ of your matches, could you substitute the ai to play for you? 
Mar 16 10:54:33 <rubao>	it should not be any time soon, at least /me hopes
Mar 16 10:55:06 <hukhan>	I bet pro players could make money by selling neural nets trained on their style of play, so people could practice with them 
Mar 16 10:55:07 <rubao>	chkoehle: ha , too hard  too do
Mar 16 10:55:12 <chkoehle>	really?
Mar 16 10:55:21 <chkoehle>	wait which part
Mar 16 10:55:21 <hukhan>	and apply this to not only smash 
Mar 16 10:55:22 <chkoehle>	making it play
Mar 16 10:55:27 <chkoehle>	or because its smash
Mar 16 10:55:42 <chkoehle>	ok random question: what if it was a simpler game that you had access to the source code
Mar 16 10:55:44 <chkoehle>	would that be a lot easier?
Mar 16 10:56:07 <rubao>	hukhan: then eventually, when trained enough, the robots can replace us in gaming(smash) lol
Mar 16 10:56:11 <hukhan>	you don't need access to the source code, you just need access to their inputs and some sort of a feedback result, no? 
Mar 16 10:56:41 <chkoehle>	i wanted to steer the convo into a direction of me making it for my games
Mar 16 10:56:48 *	chkoehle embraces his selfish mode
Mar 16 10:57:17 <hukhan>	I'm surprised people haven't applied neural nets for making ai in like mmorpgs that act independently 
Mar 16 10:57:28 <chkoehle>	i was considering this for runescape
Mar 16 10:57:33 <hukhan>	that would be dope 
Mar 16 10:57:46 <chkoehle>	only because its a simple and easy game
Mar 16 10:58:06 <rubao>	hukhan:  not for mmorpg now, but an AI do " kinda" existed for dota 2 sometime ago
Mar 16 10:58:17 <hukhan>	what kind of ai? 
Mar 16 10:58:22 <chkoehle>	i thought someone at openAI made some dota2 bot that wrecked their top players
Mar 16 10:58:29 <rubao>	yup ^
Mar 16 10:59:10 <almac>	optimal bots are kind of boring, there's been some research and prototypes done
Mar 16 10:59:11 <almac>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxwPr9oxUMw
Mar 16 10:59:14 <almac>	pretty neat though
Mar 16 10:59:42 <almac>	at least in smash 4, the optimal bot would never jump, because it introduced landing lag and puts you in disadvantage state
Mar 16 11:00:06 <almac>	so bots based around completely grounded characters and frame perfect sheilds/dodges/movements would probably come out on top
Mar 16 11:00:17 <almac>	i wonder if that'd mean little mac becomes top tier ..
Mar 16 11:00:30 <chkoehle>	little mac on top
Mar 16 11:00:35 <chkoehle>	i've learned to hate jumping
Mar 16 11:00:46 <chkoehle>	anything not on the ground sucks
Mar 16 11:03:16 <hukhan>	I think bots that play like actual players would definitely be recieved a lot better
Mar 16 11:03:33 <hukhan>	that's the problem with fighting ai in smash, perfect shields/dodges are just kinda lame
Mar 16 11:03:51 <almac>	yeah but then you're basically sabotaging your own ai
Mar 16 11:04:06 <rubao>	hukhan: yea, it kinda made game not fun
Mar 16 11:04:35 *	rubao thinks people make mistakes in games are also a fun part to make the game interesting :D
Mar 16 11:04:42 <hukhan>	I don't think so, if you get input data over thousands of games from pro players, you can get bots trained on their styles, then practice with their playstyle through bots
Mar 16 11:05:08 <hukhan>	that's a lot more interesting imo
Mar 16 11:05:19 <rubao>	yea
Mar 16 11:05:31 <rubao>	and it made the ai theoretically beatable too
Mar 16 11:05:36 <almac>	yeah i guess so, but would they not learn 'optimal' playstyles over thousands more games?
Mar 16 11:05:55 <chkoehle>	i always wanted to see the perfect AI play to see what kind of playstyle emerges
Mar 16 11:05:56 <hukhan>	more data would result in accuracy not optimal results
Mar 16 11:05:58 <almac>	like we're at the current meta of movement/play styles because of how much time has progress and how many games they've played
Mar 16 11:06:02 <hukhan>	on a neural net
Mar 16 11:06:19 <hukhan>	it depends on your goals and what you are trying to achieve
Mar 16 11:06:20 <almac>	if we could speed it up with simulations and say run games at 1000x the speed, would we reach optimal plays sooner?
Mar 16 11:06:47 <hukhan>	if you're result scores for the neural net are based on wins not accuracy to player style then you will reach otpimal results
Mar 16 11:06:48 <almac>	i clearly just want to take over the world with smash bots
Mar 16 11:07:08 <hukhan>	this is at leas my layman understanding of machine learning 
Mar 16 11:07:09 <almac>	a bunch of self aware, frame perfect amiibos
Mar 16 11:07:10 <hukhan>	at least*
Mar 16 11:07:18 <almac>	is like toy story if they went evil
Mar 16 11:07:22 <hukhan>	LOL 
Mar 16 11:09:05 <chkoehle>	that was epic
Mar 16 11:13:10 <rubao>	lol
Mar 16 11:20:23 <hukhan>	clessard is in the buildling
Mar 16 11:21:45 <rubao>	wot
Mar 16 11:22:07 <rubao>	nice
Mar 16 11:24:33 <chkoehle>	buildling

Mar 16 11:26:33 <almac>	H Y P E
Mar 16 11:27:04 <almac>	in which case, rubao and clessard can play today
Mar 16 11:27:15 <rubao>	yup
Mar 16 11:27:16 <almac>	if there's time of course

Mar 19 10:01:52 <almac>	lufimtse, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_GNpaWXRIo
Mar 19 10:01:56 <hukhan>	nice nice
Mar 19 10:02:01 <almac>	i just liked that for humair, you might find it interesting too
Mar 19 10:02:05 <hukhan>	want to do our match @lunch?
Mar 19 10:02:05 <almac>	it's a breakdown of how to beat cloud
Mar 19 10:02:10 <almac>	hukhan, yeah lets do it
Mar 19 10:02:22 <hukhan>	I have a feeling toon link won't make it into smash5
Mar 19 10:02:33 <almac>	i'm on the fence about that one
Mar 19 10:02:41 <hukhan>	he's not showing up in any of the user wanted polls :(
Mar 19 10:03:02 <almac>	if not toon link, i think maybe either younger link comes back, or the BotW Link is a hybrid link (not too heavy, but not too light)
Mar 19 10:03:12 <lufimtse>	almac, interesting
Mar 19 10:03:16 <hukhan>	dude that would be sick
Mar 19 10:03:40 <almac>	but all speculation for now
Mar 19 10:03:42 <almac>	:/
Mar 19 10:03:51 <hukhan>	aye
Mar 19 10:03:57 <almac>	im hoping for a revamped Ganondorf moveset
Mar 19 10:04:03 <almac>	and a new zelda moveset
Mar 19 10:04:21 <hukhan>	it seems to be a meme, but I would actually want them to add goku 
Mar 19 10:04:24 <hukhan>	Lol
Mar 19 10:05:21 <hukhan>	his up B can be a kaioken
Mar 19 10:05:28 <cchianel>	I want paper mario
Mar 19 10:05:59 <almac>	good god goku
Mar 19 10:09:00 <cchianel>	(well paper mario & luigi as one character)
Mar 19 11:05:40 <almac>	current games on deck: 1. almac vs. hukhan 2. lufimtse vs. cchianel|lunch 3. lbullen vs. clessard
Mar 19 13:51:35 <chkoehle>	and hopefully i get mine in today
Mar 19 13:52:33 <hukhan>	I'm salty about that first match almac
Mar 19 13:52:34 <hukhan>	lol
Mar 19 13:52:38 <hukhan>	ahhhhhhhh
Mar 19 13:53:00 <almac>	lol that was brutal
Mar 19 13:53:16 <almac>	i was mentally prepared to counter-pick your mario in the next match lol
Mar 19 13:53:36 <hukhan>	hahaha
Mar 19 13:54:24 <hukhan>	I feel like I was definitely a lot closer this time with mario instead of link
Mar 19 13:54:51 <almac>	as a heavy character, cloud has to respect mario a lot more in the early-mid game
Mar 19 15:11:13 <cchianel>	lufimtse, tell me when you ready to smash
Mar 19 15:11:27 <lufimtse>	cchianel, are you around at 5ish?
Mar 19 15:11:33 <lufimtse>	or tomorrow morning?
Mar 19 15:11:40 <cchianel>	lufimtse, in a rare case yes and yes

Mar 22 10:10:55 <hukhan>	does this tell us anything new about the upcoming smash???
Mar 22 10:11:15 <almac>	which tournament are you referring to? theres typically a major every other weekend
Mar 22 10:11:27 <almac>	isn't there one in vegas or something this weekend?
Mar 22 10:11:38 <hukhan>	invitational 2018
Mar 22 10:11:41 <hukhan>	announced by nintendo, I think?
Mar 22 10:11:41 <almac>	oh sweet jesus
Mar 22 10:11:44 <almac>	it's 'that' one
Mar 22 10:12:06 <hukhan>	is nintendo VS - nintendo? 
Mar 22 10:12:26 <almac>	IIRC, they invited the smash pros that were pretty well known to an event
Mar 22 10:12:35 <almac>	and had them try smash 4 for the first time after they unveiled it
Mar 22 10:12:59 <hukhan>	have they done it for the ports?

Mar 22 10:15:15 <almac>	smash4 came out sept/oct
Mar 22 10:15:37 <hukhan>	maybe they'll release it while nintendo online is free

Mar 22 10:16:32 <almac>	mmmmm free
Mar 22 10:16:41 <almac>	i just want a trailer :(
Mar 22 10:17:25 <hukhan>	if we had smash on switch right now, would you keep a switch open on your desk so we could play matches from our desks?
Mar 22 10:17:39 <hukhan>	loll
Mar 22 10:17:48 <hukhan>	wonder if they'll have lan
Mar 22 10:18:01 <almac>	the wii u lan adapter supposedly works on the switch
Mar 22 10:18:03 <almac>	and will be necessary
Mar 22 10:18:11 <hukhan>	yeahh

Mar 23 12:05:33 <lufimtse>	almac, game
Mar 23 12:05:34 <lufimtse>	?
Mar 23 12:05:38 <hukhan_wfh>	ooooooooooo
Mar 23 12:05:41 <almac>	whenever this meeting ends
Mar 23 12:05:47 <lufimtse>	almac, okkhey
Mar 23 12:05:47 <almac>	its the meeting that keeps on giving
Mar 23 12:05:57 <hukhan_wfh>	you guys have too many meetings
Mar 23 12:06:15 <almac>	what started as like 10 minute status meeting is like an hour and 10 min (so far) sprint review meeting
Mar 23 12:06:40 <lufimtse>	almac, just print a life-size version of you that moves it's head back and fourth from time to time and go play during meetings.
Mar 23 12:07:03 <almac>	i can animate a gif of me or something and use it instead of a webcam
Mar 23 12:07:10 <almac>	but lol i've got my camera off anyways
Mar 23 12:07:35 <hukhan_wfh>	almac what's the elo tool on heroku you're using again?
Mar 23 12:07:52 <almac>	http://rht-smash-elo.herokuapp.com/games/1
Mar 23 12:08:01 <lufimtse>	almac, on my previous job, I got hold of a wireless headset and used to walk around the office during meetings.  Make tea, eat snacks.
Mar 23 12:08:14 <almac>	there's no auth stuff, so just don't go adding random scores ;)
Mar 23 12:08:22 <almac>	lufimtse, thats not a bad idea
Mar 23 12:08:52 <hukhan_wfh>	oof there are no permission settings?
Mar 23 12:08:55 <almac>	hukhan_wfh, i also have the credentials to get into the heroku-hosted DB for it, so I may migrate off of it one day if i have enough time
Mar 23 12:09:32 <almac>	but it works for now :/
Mar 23 12:09:46 <almac>	it shouldn't be too hard to just scrape the rankings and generate a bracket using the challonge api
Mar 23 12:09:57 <almac>	and/or push changes to the db
Mar 23 12:10:03 <hukhan_wfh>	I wanted to know if they have an api exposed to update stats
Mar 23 12:10:13 <almac>	heroku? or challonge?
Mar 23 12:10:19 <hukhan_wfh>	heroku
Mar 23 12:10:45 <almac>	there's probably a way we can use the api to do so
Mar 23 12:10:53 <hukhan_wfh>	so we could hook it up to the bot, challenge and post results through the bot and automatically update elo
Mar 23 12:11:20 <almac>	im assuming we can just use the same push/get whatever http requests are going through the app
Mar 23 12:11:26 <almac>	yeah that too
Mar 23 13:06:31 <chkoehle>	lbullen i will be having lunch at the food court
Mar 23 13:06:35 <chkoehle>	after i can play any time
Mar 23 13:42:37 <almac>	!matches
Mar 23 13:42:38 <SM4SHBOT>	\(`O`)/: Current open matches to be played are:
Mar 23 13:42:38 <SM4SHBOT>	cchianel vs. rubao
Mar 23 13:42:42 <almac>	nice
Mar 23 13:43:10 <almac>	bracket came along pretty nice, feel free to finish it up next week (either dq me from finals or that game can wait til april 9th)
Mar 23 13:43:30 <almac>	I've set up the next bracket too if you guys are down, as long as you have a challonge account you can update the bracket
Mar 23 13:43:42 <hukhan_wfh>	ooof you 2-0'd leo
Mar 23 13:43:44 <hukhan_wfh>	too
Mar 23 13:44:28 <almac>	hukhan_wfh, patience was key, rather than playing ive been trying to read about mindset and the neutral game
Mar 23 13:44:34 <almac>	somehow it paid off today ;)
Mar 23 13:44:50 <hukhan_wfh>	interesting, that's generally leo's playstyle too
Mar 23 14:04:47 <chkoehle|lunch>	did anyone want to play smash

Apr 11 11:50:18 <almac>	smash mods via nairo's winter mod pack are now live
Apr 11 11:50:46 <almac>	there's an app on the wii u main menu called haxchi that needs to be run before smash4 in order to load the skins
Apr 11 11:51:10 <almac>	also lufimtse not sure if you knew, but i got roy/ryu/lucas downloaded yesterday, the lan adapter works well
Apr 11 11:51:24 <lufimtse>	oh
Apr 11 11:51:26 <lufimtse>	nice!
Apr 11 11:52:33 <almac>	only note is that when there's like >4 people playing then the mods usually tend to not show up, so they probably won't work for our mammoth 8 player games
Apr 11 11:55:29 <lufimtse>	almac, are there any skins for Peach in the mod?
Apr 11 11:55:42 <almac>	yeah there should be like 8 skins per character
Apr 11 11:55:47 <lufimtse>	ah
Apr 11 11:55:49 <lufimtse>	nice
Apr 11 11:55:58 <almac>	some characters that aren't as popular/basic don't get many fancy ones .. wii fit trainer comes to mind
Apr 11 11:56:00 <lufimtse>	I'll be down for a game after 5 ish.
Apr 11 11:56:25 <almac>	there's a pretty good balance of meme-y and stylish looking skins
Apr 11 11:56:45 <almac>	also it automatically sets the rules to 2-stock when you load the game! best QoL feature

Apr 20 09:51:53 <almac|wfh>	Yo! On a Smash-related note, we've got two outstanding brackets at the moment, and I figure we may be able to squeeze in one last one before the newterns start
Apr 20 09:52:23 <almac|wfh>	https://challonge.com/rht_mar_2_2018 is almost done, and I think there are people in the office today to advance the bracket?
Apr 20 09:52:43 <almac|wfh>	we need cchianel vs. rubao, winner plays hukhan, winner plays lufimtse 
Apr 20 09:53:07 <almac|wfh>	and less hopeful for this one, but https://challonge.com/rht_mar_1_2018
Apr 20 09:53:10 <cchianel>	almac|wfh, can we use custom skins?
Apr 20 09:53:19 <almac|wfh>	has hukhan & cchianel vs. lufimtse & clessard
Apr 20 09:53:25 <almac|wfh>	cchianel, yeah sure i don't see why not
Apr 20 09:53:39 <almac|wfh>	i'd say just get an okay from your opponent so it's not a super distracting skin
Apr 20 09:53:52 <almac|wfh>	like probably best not to use something like Sanic or Wigglytuff
Apr 20 10:03:18 <hukhan>	the 2s I don't know if it's likely because leo probably won't be available until 5 or after (guess)
Apr 20 10:03:25 <hukhan>	also
Apr 20 10:03:31 <hukhan>	almac|wfh: you tryin to dodge earth day buddy?
Apr 20 10:03:57 <almac|wfh>	hukhan, yeah doubles was wishful thinking .. one day it'll be finished
Apr 20 10:04:01 <almac|wfh>	O.o
Apr 20 12:01:28 <cchianel>	cchianel wins 2-0 agains rubao
Apr 20 12:08:28 <almac|wfh>	cchianel|afk ty
Apr 20 12:10:11 <cchianel|afk>	hukhan wins 2-0 against cchianel|afk 
Apr 20 12:10:56 <almac|wfh>	cchianel, ty
Apr 20 12:13:21 <almac|wfh>	dang you guys got on that quick
