Feb 16 15:11:16 <chkoehle>	almac how does one go about hosting a bot for this channel
Feb 16 15:11:23 <chkoehle>	is it run on s01.yyz....?
Feb 16 15:11:33 <chkoehle>	s/run/hosted
Feb 16 15:12:18 <almac>	i actually don't know
Feb 16 15:12:28 <chkoehle>	i wonder where thermostat-bot is hosted
Feb 16 15:12:34 <almac>	it'd be like vilebot
Feb 16 15:12:44 <almac>	thermostat-bot lives on jmatsuok's computer
Feb 16 15:12:54 <almac>	used to be hosted by omair
Feb 16 15:15:26 <chkoehle>	i might make something over the weekend
Feb 16 15:15:41 <chkoehle>	some simple bot that can get data and notify people and scrape elo
Feb 16 15:15:51 <chkoehle>	(unless someone else wants to)
Feb 16 15:17:20 <chkoehle>	i also assume the url is:
Feb 16 15:17:34 <chkoehle>	rht_<month-3-letters>-<1 or 2>-2018
Feb 16 15:17:41 <almac>	yup that'd be it
Feb 16 15:17:46 <chkoehle>	underscores... 
Feb 16 15:17:56 <chkoehle>	evil
Feb 16 15:18:00 <chkoehle>	just kidding
Feb 16 15:18:07 <almac>	wooo underscores
Feb 16 15:22:57 <cchianel>	Test
Feb 16 15:23:22 <hukhan>	you should add features like !challenge chkoehle 
Feb 16 15:23:32 <almac>	grudge match
Feb 16 15:23:48 <hukhan>	maybe like an optional message
Feb 16 15:23:54 <chkoehle>	can that count for elo?
Feb 16 15:23:56 <hukhan>	.!challenge chkoehle "don't be a wuss"
Feb 16 15:24:32 <almac>	hm .. i don't see why not as long as it's a consenting ranked-type match
Feb 16 15:24:43 <cchianel_>	Test
Feb 16 15:24:47 <hukhan>	fail
Feb 16 15:24:49 <cchianel_>	Okay, added login command
Feb 16 15:25:17 <hukhan>	oh you know what 
Feb 16 15:25:43 <hukhan>	give an option to make it ranked as well
Feb 16 15:25:49 <hukhan>	or is that too many options
Feb 16 15:25:50 <hukhan>	lol
Feb 16 15:25:55 <chkoehle>	there is no such thing as too many options
Feb 16 15:26:09 <hukhan>	!challenge chkoehle "don't be a wuss" -r
Feb 16 15:26:10 <chkoehle>	however idk how that'd play with almac 's elo system
Feb 16 15:26:16 <chkoehle>	ooh recursive
Feb 16 15:26:16 <cchianel>	chkoehle, add an option to play against skynet
Feb 16 15:26:20 <almac>	i'll be looking to migrate that soon
Feb 16 15:26:22 <chkoehle>	i dont want to get to 0 elo
Feb 16 15:26:25 <almac>	soon(tm)
Feb 16 15:26:38 <almac>	and based on how busy/lazy i get when i go home
Feb 16 15:26:56 <hukhan>	this would actually be kinda fun
Feb 16 15:27:19 <chkoehle>	where the hell is lbullen
Feb 16 15:27:23 <chkoehle>	and jpinkney especially
Feb 16 15:27:26 <hukhan>	he went home
Feb 16 15:27:31 <hukhan>	jpinkney never left home
Feb 16 15:27:43 <chkoehle>	we have to convert every intern to smash
Feb 16 15:27:48 <chkoehle>	newtern*
Feb 16 15:28:01 <chkoehle>	100%
Feb 16 15:28:49 <almac>	of course
Feb 16 15:28:53 <almac>	it's a first day activity
Feb 16 15:29:00 <almac>	we throw them into a bracket and judge them
Feb 16 15:29:24 <almac>	LOL that's how they should do team rankings ..
Feb 16 15:29:31 <chkoehle>	yes ^
Feb 16 15:31:33 <rubao>	yes ^
Feb 16 15:31:40 *	rubao looks at log
Feb 16 15:32:07 <hukhan>	can we sit in the back couches with numbered sign, and rate them like on their performance by lifting up said numbered signs
Feb 16 15:33:03 <almac>	with pizza
Feb 16 15:33:32 <chkoehle>	rofl
Feb 16 15:40:56 <chkoehle>	almac does challonge have built in elo to assign matches or did you handcraft them? i forget
Feb 16 15:41:05 <chkoehle>	by handcraft i mean took your elo offlin calcs
Feb 16 15:41:06 <almac>	it doesn't
Feb 16 15:41:07 <chkoehle>	and applied them
Feb 16 15:41:28 <almac>	i'm using a repo i found on github deployed on heroku atm

Feb 21 12:44:58 <chkoehle>	jpinkney lufimtse you guys should play your game today since you'd be surprised how many branches on the challonge thing it blocks (directly and indirectly)
Feb 21 12:45:01 <chkoehle>	or soon
Feb 21 12:45:06 <chkoehle>	ha i need my TM characters, 1 sec
Feb 21 12:45:16 <chkoehle>	Soonâ„¢
Feb 21 12:45:19 <chkoehle>	there we go :D
Feb 21 12:47:31 <almac|wfh>	technically i think there's enough people in the office s.t we could finish the bracket up until winners & losers finals
Feb 21 12:48:48 <jpinkney>	We are going to play today
Feb 21 12:49:35 <chkoehle>	if you guys play before 2:30 then whoever loses could play cchianel|lunch and then the winner of that can play me
Feb 21 12:49:39 <chkoehle>	see, look at how selfish i am
Feb 21 12:50:14 <chkoehle>	it would also allow a hukhan vs someone game to happen and open up the top bracket too, maybe i'm just an idealist at this point heh
Feb 21 12:50:42 <jpinkney>	lufimtse I'm down to play whenever, i'm back from lunch
Feb 21 13:51:52 <chkoehle>	jpinkney it is time
Feb 21 13:52:59 <hukhan>	we can get 5/10/11 done today
Feb 21 14:40:47 <lufimtse>	hukhan, wanna play after work?
Feb 21 14:40:55 <hukhan>	lufimtse: yis sir
Feb 21 14:41:28 <lufimtse>	hukhan, okhay. Maybe we should all just burn through the tournament at 5pm
Feb 21 14:41:28 <lufimtse>	ha ha
Feb 21 14:41:40 <lufimtse>	I'm still waiting for Tom from first tournament.
Feb 21 14:41:45 <lufimtse>	Jo, we need to get more people involved.
Feb 21 14:41:46 <hukhan>	if people show up - it's totally possible
Feb 21 14:41:57 <lufimtse>	like the new debugger guy 
Feb 21 14:42:30 <almac|wfh>	lufimtse, that first one is never gonna finish
Feb 21 14:42:35 <almac|wfh>	we aint seeing tom for a while
Feb 21 14:42:47 <almac|wfh>	(now that ive said it, he'll be in tomorrow? jynxed)
Feb 21 14:42:49 <hukhan>	he did mention to let him know when his match is pending
Feb 21 14:42:55 <almac|wfh>	wait really
Feb 21 14:42:58 <almac|wfh>	boo
Feb 21 14:43:01 <hukhan>	yeah lol
Feb 21 14:43:22 <almac|wfh>	see if we can get him in on a consistent basis, then it'll be easier than cramming the entire bracket into a day
Feb 21 14:43:33 <almac|wfh>	but we're still interested in a doubles bracket for the upcoming one right?
Feb 21 14:43:49 <hukhan>	yeaah - but do we have the people?
Feb 21 14:45:59 <almac|wfh>	all we need is an even number of people
Feb 21 14:46:17 <almac|wfh>	it's not going to be as large, but coordinating 4-player matches will require more time potentially
Feb 21 14:49:09 <chkoehle>	<lufimtse> like the new debugger guy
Feb 21 14:49:15 <chkoehle>	do you know how much C++ he knows
Feb 21 14:49:25 <lufimtse>	chkoehle, probably a lot.
Feb 21 14:49:36 <lufimtse>	chkoehle, I'm gonna guess he is new God of C++ in office.
Feb 21 14:49:39 <chkoehle>	GOOD... good...
Feb 21 14:49:46 <chkoehle>	<insert prequel meme here>
Feb 21 14:50:29 <chkoehle>	i was hoping thered be someone who could shed some light on some of the more insane crap in C++
Feb 21 14:50:42 <chkoehle>	idk how much you've used it

Feb 27 13:10:15 <almac>	the bracket is ready, but I can't set more than one e-mail address per pair, so let me know if you want to volunteer your challonge account to be linked for your team
Feb 27 13:11:06 <almac>	first games are: almac & rubao vs. lbullen & jpinkney, and lufimtse & clessard vs. hukhan & cchianel  
Feb 27 13:11:31 <cchianel>	XD TEAM EAP UNITE!
Feb 27 13:11:59 <almac>	the bracket is smaller so that (should in theory ..) give us more time to finish games
Feb 27 13:12:13 <almac>	just a note that the rules are a tad different, doubles are 3-stock 8 minute timer
Feb 27 13:14:35 <hukhan>	cchianel: we will rock them
Feb 27 14:04:52 <lufimtse>	hukhan and cchianel will missile/arrow people to their death ha ha
Feb 27 14:05:12 <lufimtse>	they need to figure out a way to stand on top of each other and just fire trajectories

Feb 27 14:08:46 <almac>	hukhan, there are some tweaks you can make to your online settings on the wiiu to try and get a more stable connection
Feb 27 14:08:51 <almac>	and router settings too
Feb 27 14:09:06 <hukhan>	aside from forwarding ports?
Feb 27 14:09:17 <almac>	some DNS setting or something
Feb 27 14:09:24 <hukhan>	hmm, will take a look, thanks
Feb 27 14:09:25 <almac>	network mumbo jumbo i have no idea
Feb 27 14:09:31 <almac>	but i followed some guys youtube video
Feb 27 14:09:41 <hukhan>	did you notice a signifcant difference?
Feb 27 14:09:45 <almac>	well,
Feb 27 14:09:47 <almac>	a bit
Feb 27 14:09:56 <almac>	BUT the router i was using was like 3+ years old
Feb 27 14:10:00 <almac>	so i replaced it on boxing day
Feb 27 14:10:03 <hukhan>	I played against a falcon, and he was dancing around me and I felt like I was playing a picfture book, it was furstrating
Feb 27 14:10:07 <almac>	and now it's really good
Feb 27 14:10:18 <hukhan>	hmmm all right
Feb 27 14:10:24 <almac>	yeah I usually just kill myself if the lag is too bad
Feb 27 14:10:39 <almac>	eventually ill find someone with a pretty decent connection, and hope we can play for a while
Feb 27 14:14:18 <almac>	hukhan, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9mb77Gr86o
Feb 27 14:14:20 <almac>	is the jist of it
Feb 27 14:14:24 <almac>	not sure if it's legit or placebo
Feb 27 14:14:39 <hukhan>	LOL 
Feb 27 14:14:48 <hukhan>	okay I'll play a few matches and then try this out and compare
Mar 01 11:40:30 <almac>	anyone have time for games today? jpinkney & lbullen? i guess gotta figure out what time works for rubao too 
Mar 01 11:41:06 <lbullen>	so down
Mar 01 11:41:57 <lbullen>	jpinkney, should we quit our jobs to get more time to practice our sweet team combos?
Mar 01 11:42:41 <almac>	lbullen, things to study: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nOJWuy5Bdo
Mar 01 11:43:59 <almac>	also lbullen, starting at around 0:13 is a good application of what footstools can be used for: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuDLo-H_W8o
Mar 01 11:45:03 <lbullen>	that hurts to watch, so good
Mar 01 11:47:24 <jpinkney>	lbullen yes
Mar 01 11:52:06 <rubao>	:o
Mar 01 11:52:11 <rubao>	skills++
Mar 01 11:56:16 <lbullen>	rumble in the jungle @noon?
Mar 01 11:57:47 <almac>	sounds good to me
Mar 01 12:45:18 <lbullen>	...duel...?
Mar 01 12:45:36 <almac>	suuuuure
Mar 01 12:48:34 <cchianel>	(doesn't happen)
Mar 01 12:55:49 <almac>	:(
Mar 02 09:27:06 <hukhan>	almac: I watched something on how to use SDI's to escape bayo's witch twist combos 
Mar 02 09:27:16 <almac>	from the BeefySmashDoods?
Mar 02 09:27:25 <hukhan>	I don't remember 
Mar 02 09:27:27 <hukhan>	lol
Mar 02 09:27:27 <almac>	they make really sick tech videos btw
Mar 02 09:27:29 <hukhan>	it was on their subreddit
Mar 02 09:27:35 <hukhan>	last night
Mar 02 09:27:37 <almac>	was it narrated by a guy with a nice voice?
Mar 02 09:27:41 <hukhan>	yes
Mar 02 09:27:43 <almac>	kind of deep, bit of an accent
Mar 02 09:27:46 <almac>	yeah lol beefysmashdoods
Mar 02 09:27:48 <almac>	great stuff
Mar 02 09:27:53 <almac>	bayonetta is nuts
Mar 02 09:27:53 <hukhan>	yeahh
Mar 02 09:28:03 <almac>	you gotta SDI the heck out of your controller
Mar 02 09:28:12 <hukhan>	I want to try it out with you if you got the time today
Mar 02 09:28:14 <hukhan>	lol
Mar 02 09:28:17 <almac>	of course
Mar 02 09:28:45 <hukhan>	one thing he didn't mention was, do you have to SDI as soon as you get hit, or can you start maching your joystick before it happens
Mar 02 09:28:55 <hukhan>	mashing*
Mar 02 09:29:37 <almac>	you can start anytime and it helps
Mar 02 09:29:43 <almac>	but to get out of it you need to start asap
Mar 02 09:29:46 <hukhan>	nice
Mar 02 09:29:47 <almac>	hukhan, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUm_ayyLb0
Mar 02 09:29:51 <almac>	check at like 0:15 seconds
Mar 02 09:30:06 <almac>	Tweek, Keitaro and Cosmos made like an hour long video of how to get out of bayo's combos
Mar 02 09:30:14 <hukhan>	oh sweet
Mar 02 09:30:17 <almac>	BeefySmashDoods did like the tl:dr version of it lol
Mar 02 09:30:24 <almac>	but 0:15 to 0:30 is pretty jokes
Mar 02 09:30:50 <almac>	for context the emo looking guy on the left is possibly the best cloud/bayo player in the world, and the guy on the right is a popular commentator
Mar 02 09:31:02 <almac>	but pretty darn funny, you can actually get out of witch twist up
Mar 02 09:31:05 <hukhan>	LOL 
Mar 02 09:31:09 <hukhan>	"how did you go so high"
Mar 02 09:31:19 <almac>	lol it's a pretty jokes video
Mar 02 09:31:33 <hukhan>	did he SDI up away from bayo there?
Mar 02 09:32:02 <almac>	yeah, they later go on to describe how to get out of her side twists assuming you don't sdi off the top
Mar 02 09:32:09 <hukhan>	yeah
Mar 02 09:32:11 <almac>	because you need to be reallllllly fast at mashing your analog
Mar 02 09:32:24 <almac>	it's really likely you should just set up to get out of the second combo instead
Mar 02 09:32:56 <almac>	but also if you regular DI down away after first twist (assuming you don't SDI) i believe you can fall out of some of her side follow-up combos
Mar 02 09:33:12 <almac>	so its pretty much a mind game when playing against a bayo
Mar 02 10:20:19 <hukhan>	oof why is she so complicated
Mar 02 10:20:21 <hukhan>	lol
Mar 02 10:26:20 <almac>	cause nintendo wants your $5.99
Mar 02 10:26:42 <almac>	she used to be more broken, she's actually been nerfed (if you can believe it)
Mar 02 10:38:08 <hukhan>	yeah I saw that
Mar 02 10:38:09 <hukhan>	insane
Mar 02 14:52:58 <hukhan>	yooooo
Mar 02 14:53:03 <hukhan>	friday night smash!?!?

Mar 02 14:54:35 <almac>	won't last more than an hour
Mar 02 14:54:36 <hukhan>	I can't handle that many shots
Mar 02 14:54:41 <almac>	**5 minutes

Mar 08 11:43:13 <almac>	if anyone hears me yelling around 3pm today, it's cause smash got announced
Mar 08 11:43:18 <almac>	otherwise im gonna be sad this evening
Mar 08 11:49:11 <rubao>	wot
Mar 08 11:49:23 *	rubao will be more excited if pokemon got announced :p
Mar 08 11:49:31 <almac>	that'd be pretty hype too
Mar 08 11:49:32 <rubao>	or labo#2
Mar 08 11:49:40 <rubao>	labo ultimate
Mar 08 11:49:46 <almac>	labo plastic

Mar 08 11:50:04 <rubao>	labo C++/JAVA/PYTHON :p
Mar 08 11:50:06 <almac>	basically a gundam
Mar 08 11:50:40 <rubao>	almac++
Mar 08 12:24:47 <hukhan>	almac: is there any reason to suggest a new smash will be announced? 
Mar 08 12:25:06 <almac>	gather round children, it's story time
Mar 08 12:25:12 <cchianel>	hukhan, yes: cause smash is awesome
Mar 08 12:25:21 <hukhan>	-_-
Mar 08 12:25:34 <almac>	well, its been 5 years since last smash was annoucned, which is similar time between brawl -> 4
Mar 08 12:25:56 <almac>	last year there was a patch to update the wii u smash 4 for the cloud/corrin/bayonetta amiibos that had just come out
Mar 08 12:26:19 <almac>	in the code for the patch, it was found they had reverted some of the status codes back to what they were like in dev mode
Mar 08 12:26:29 <almac>	but it was toggled off previously or something
Mar 08 12:26:42 <almac>	so evidence that smash 4 went from final prod -> development
Mar 08 12:27:09 <hukhan>	hmm
Mar 08 12:27:25 <almac>	i guess also speculation due to the popularity of the mario kart ports
Mar 08 12:27:31 <hukhan>	yeah 
Mar 08 12:27:33 <almac>	they couldn't have annoucned smash last year, because of ARMS
Mar 08 12:27:37 <hukhan>	even if its a port
Mar 08 12:27:40 <hukhan>	I'd consider getting a switch 
Mar 08 12:27:42 <hukhan>	lol
Mar 08 12:27:48 <almac>	they wouldn't deliberately kill their newest IP with smash they'd be nuts
Mar 08 12:29:09 <almac>	e3 is more realistic, but im tired of waiting T.T
Mar 08 12:30:41 <hukhan>	if it's a new smash and they drop toon link, I'm quitting
Mar 08 12:33:13 <lbullen>	hukhan got those priorities straight
Mar 08 12:42:21 <hukhan>	lufimtse, cchianel, are you guys available to do the 2v2?
Mar 08 12:42:34 <cchianel>	hukhan, yes
Mar 08 12:42:47 <hukhan>	kk so if lufimtse is available, we can do it now
Mar 08 12:42:49 <lufimtse>	hukhan,  5pm?
Mar 08 12:43:01 <lufimtse>	hukhan, or I could do a quick one
Mar 08 12:43:01 <lufimtse>	now
Mar 08 12:43:10 <hukhan>	yeah that would be better (if you can)
Mar 08 12:43:14 <hukhan>	cchianel: leaves early
Mar 08 12:43:14 <lufimtse>	ok,
Mar 08 12:43:15 <lufimtse>	now?
Mar 08 12:43:17 <hukhan>	ya
Mar 08 12:59:06 <almac>	damn those were hype
Mar 08 12:59:18 <almac>	lbullen & jpinkney vs. lufimtse & clessard
Mar 08 12:59:32 <cchianel>	2-0 hukhan and cchianel 
Mar 08 12:59:38 <almac>	almac & rubao vs. cchianel & hukhan 
Mar 08 12:59:42 <almac>	are the next ones
Mar 08 13:00:11 <hukhan>	2s are intense
Mar 08 13:00:20 <rubao>	:o
Mar 08 13:00:31 <rubao>	i am mentally ready for the match
Mar 08 13:02:06 <lbullen>	lufimtse jpinkney match at 5?
Mar 08 13:03:49 <almac>	2s are a different beast
Mar 08 13:03:57 <almac>	playing the 2v1 is pretty exhausting
Mar 08 13:04:29 <almac>	rubao, we going double cloud again?
Mar 08 13:04:39 <rubao>	sure
Mar 08 13:04:47 <rubao>	up B 
Mar 08 13:04:49 <rubao>	for entire match
Mar 08 13:04:53 <rubao>	until one falls 
Mar 08 13:04:59 <rubao>	:D
Mar 08 13:05:11 *	rubao secretly reveals this evil strategy
Mar 08 13:05:32 <almac>	and then adapts to not use that strategy so they think we're running this strategy but really its just a long con
Mar 08 13:05:46 <rubao>	lol
Mar 08 13:05:48 <rubao>	almac++
Mar 08 13:09:50 <rubao>	almac: ready for playnig?
Mar 08 13:09:56 <rubao>	s/playnig/playing
Mar 08 13:10:04 <almac>	yeah sure
Mar 08 13:25:14 <hukhan>	almac|lunch: I need to play your cloud more >:|
Mar 08 13:25:22 <hukhan>	are you gonna play @5
Mar 08 13:25:25 <hukhan>	after their game
Mar 08 13:25:42 <almac|lunch>	hukhan, did your wifi get any better?
Mar 08 13:25:49 <almac|lunch>	add 'ayymac' on wii u
Mar 08 13:26:15 <almac|lunch>	but can likely stay after 5 today to play some
Mar 08 13:26:20 <hukhan>	haven't had time to try it out yet, but I'll note it down
Mar 08 13:26:23 <hukhan>	kk
Mar 08 13:26:25 <hukhan>	sweet
Mar 08 13:26:46 <hukhan>	also lol@name
Mar 08 13:27:04 <almac|lunch>	yeah i can't change my wiiu name, that used to be my gamer tag at tournaments
Mar 08 13:27:32 <almac|lunch>	but one of the best players from like manitoba or saskatechewawn goes by the name 'amac', so they thought i was memeing him or some guy actually thought i was him once
Mar 08 13:28:27 <hukhan>	hahahaha
Mar 08 14:29:54 <lufimtse>	lbullen, 5 could work
Mar 08 14:33:59 <almac>	wooo and doubles continues
Mar 08 15:09:01 <hukhan>	almac: 
Mar 08 15:09:05 <hukhan>	what's the news
Mar 08 15:09:09 <almac>	the news is
Mar 08 15:09:12 <almac>	that i was SO hyped
Mar 08 15:09:16 <almac>	i messed up the time conversion
Mar 08 15:09:20 <almac>	in a way that doesn't make sense
Mar 08 15:09:21 <hukhan>	:(
Mar 08 15:09:23 <almac>	it starts at 5 EST
Mar 08 15:09:28 <hukhan>	poop
Mar 08 15:09:41 <hukhan>	okay so we celebrate with smash if it's a new smash
Mar 08 15:09:48 <almac>	5 EST .. which is 2 PST. Because of math, 5 - 2 is 3, so it's on at 3 EST instead
Mar 08 15:09:53 <hukhan>	or, we cheer ourselves up with some smash if it's not a new smash
Mar 08 15:10:13 <almac>	that's the spirit
Mar 08 15:10:20 <almac>	so i have twitch open, some of the chat is pretty fun
Mar 08 15:10:50 <hukhan>	what are they saying?
Mar 08 15:10:56 <almac>	typical twitch chat
Mar 08 15:11:01 <almac>	it's a toxic wasteland
Mar 08 15:11:10 <almac>	of memes and broken dreams
Mar 08 15:11:54 <hukhan>	-__-
Mar 08 16:47:34 <almac>	hukhan, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQlYM-kFsjw
Mar 08 16:48:00 <almac>	that first combo they do on sheik works even better on heavy fast-fallers e.g., cloud, falcon, etc.
Mar 08 16:48:18 <almac>	if done right its an easy 60% to start the game
Mar 08 17:05:02 <rubao>	:o
Mar 08 17:05:05 <rubao>	nitendo
Mar 08 17:05:09 <rubao>	nitendo direct
Mar 08 17:06:06 <rubao>	nitendo switch
Mar 08 17:06:22 *	rubao hopes
Mar 08 17:07:44 <almac>	this direct is hype
Mar 08 17:09:23 <rubao>	lol sushi striker
Mar 08 17:09:39 *	rubao haven't seen most of the games

Mar 08 17:14:54 *	rubao is slightly ashamed of himself as a player
Mar 08 17:16:35 <rubao>	:o, the tennis seemed kinda fun
Mar 08 17:16:41 <rubao>	with the trailer
Mar 08 17:17:19 <almac>	it does look pretty good, the tennis games are fun
Mar 08 17:18:15 <rubao>	if it is multiplayerable /or online matchable 
Mar 08 17:18:23 <rubao>	I probbaly will buy it lol
Mar 08 17:18:38 *	rubao still misses the old memories from wii motion controls
