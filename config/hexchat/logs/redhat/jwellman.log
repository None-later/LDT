Jan 03 14:07:39 <jwellman>	Leooo - is there some online training I can do to help my general computer skills while its slow in sales?
Jan 03 14:36:27 <lufimtse>	hullo
Jan 03 14:36:37 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Jan 03 14:36:48 <lufimtse>	depends on what you want to learn.
Jan 03 14:37:05 <jwellman>	programming
Jan 03 14:52:17 <lufimtse>	you could try to learn some python
Jan 03 14:52:56 <jwellman>	is there something I can use to guide my learning?
Jan 03 14:57:06 <lufimtse>	How much time do you want to commit to it?
Jan 03 14:57:23 <jwellman>	I want to get the most learned in the least amount of time
Jan 03 14:57:41 <jwellman>	I want to use it in the gaps at work, when I don't have real work to be doing, but I have to be at my desk
Jan 03 14:58:29 <lufimtse>	Well, learning programming is generally not something one does to fill gaps. You'd want to sit down, get into the mindset and spend 1-2 hours at a time.
Jan 03 14:58:38 <jwellman>	hmmm
Jan 03 14:58:41 <lufimtse>	It's not like vocabulary where you can practice words one by one
Jan 03 14:58:52 <jwellman>	is there anything else technology related that might help me in the long run?
Jan 03 14:58:59 <jwellman>	in a sales career in IT
Jan 03 14:59:01 <lufimtse>	it's more like understanding connections between concepts...
Jan 03 14:59:11 <lufimtse>	Hmmm.
Jan 03 14:59:22 <lufimtse>	The Red Hat certifications are pretty useful.
Jan 03 14:59:33 <lufimtse>	Like the IT stuff.
Jan 03 14:59:41 <lufimtse>	you could try one of the basic once
Jan 03 14:59:47 <jwellman>	like sys admin?
Jan 03 14:59:49 <lufimtse>	yah
Jan 03 15:11:47 <jwellman>	I'm enrolling in that now
