Jun 23 13:07:56 <lufimtse>	Investigating.
Jun 23 13:08:15 <lufimtse>	Have you considered the deep copy issues assosiated with cloning an event?
Jun 23 13:08:29 <ericwill>	I was thinking we should enlist someone with win32 to test it
Jun 23 13:09:13 <ericwill>	hmm I don't think it should be an issue
Jun 23 13:09:20 <ericwill>	GTK does something similar
Jun 23 13:09:21 <lufimtse>	DnDEvent?
Jun 23 13:09:29 <lufimtse>	well, Gtk has structs
Jun 23 13:09:35 <lufimtse>	one event = 1 struct
Jun 23 13:09:43 <lufimtse>	thinking...
Jun 23 13:11:06 <ericwill>	I think it was more designed for the use case in the bugzilla comment
Jun 23 13:11:10 <ericwill>	not necessarily for all cases
Jun 23 13:12:44 <lufimtse>	Well, but having it in Event means it's present in DNDEvent also.
Jun 23 13:14:19 <ericwill>	okay, you investigate. maybe test it on cocoa too?

Jan 24 12:07:30 <lufimtse>	Another thing I noticed last yeaWrite code every day programmer resolutionr is that as your experience grows, you spend your time on coordination, replying to emails, being a catalyst, troubleshooting, mentoring, and generally being a project manager kind of person.

Feb 06 11:05:04 <lufimtse>	I'm firing up yed. This shit's getting serious.
Feb 06 11:05:38 <ericwill>	https://i.imgur.com/6NfmQ.jpg
Feb 06 11:05:45 <lufimtse>	he he
Feb 06 12:12:59 <lufimtse>	Snippet 88 works well, even inside Tabfolder. I observed that they create a new 'Text' for editing on every new selection, so there isn't any re-parenting, so that's probably why it works. 
Feb 06 12:13:22 <lufimtse>	Will continue to investigate
Feb 07 10:13:56 <lufimtse>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=319612
Feb 07 10:13:59 <lufimtse>	reproducible on gtk3?
Feb 07 10:14:09 <lufimtse>	I usually post gtk* version I test on.

Feb 09 09:54:28 <ericwill>	hey, you around?
Feb 09 09:59:37 <lufimtse>	Ja komondant.
Feb 09 09:59:47 <lufimtse>	^ spelling is probably bad.
Feb 09 09:59:53 <lufimtse>	reviwing patches
Feb 09 10:00:00 <ericwill>	lol, guten Morgen
Feb 09 10:00:10 <ericwill>	okay, I take it we are taking a break from the table business today?
Feb 09 10:01:09 <lufimtse>	I wouldn't say taking a break. I think the patches have priority. But technically yes, I'm postponing work on tables till patches are reviewed.
Feb 09 10:01:26 <lufimtse>	I think patch reviewes* have priority*
Feb 09 10:01:35 <ericwill>	sounds good
Feb 09 10:01:41 <lufimtse>	Or so I was told by ober Kommondant Alex,
Feb 09 10:02:32 <ericwill>	lol, the ober Kommandant has the final say
Feb 09 10:02:43 <lufimtse>	*most of the time.
Feb 09 10:03:00 <lufimtse>	he he  he.
Feb 09 10:03:28 <ericwill>	* some terms and conditions apply :)
Feb 09 14:34:27 <lufimtse>	hey
Feb 09 14:34:29 <lufimtse>	you still around?
Feb 09 14:34:35 <ericwill>	yo
Feb 09 14:34:36 <ericwill>	sup
Feb 09 14:34:46 <lufimtse>	can you give me access to your JFace-snippets repo?
Feb 09 14:34:51 <lufimtse>	I wanna dump some stuff in htere
Feb 09 14:35:00 <ericwill>	sure one sec
Feb 09 14:35:06 <lufimtse>	maybe create a folder with "stuff that doesn't work" of sort.
Feb 09 14:35:14 <lufimtse>	And we work on those.
Feb 09 14:35:28 <lufimtse>	LeoUfimtsev
Feb 09 14:35:31 <lufimtse>	^ User
Feb 09 14:35:57 <ericwill>	sent
Feb 09 14:35:58 <ericwill>	btw
Feb 09 14:36:05 <ericwill>	I made a new discovery this morning re: table issues
Feb 09 14:36:57 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Feb 09 14:37:15 <lufimtse>	I reviewed the DateTime, seems fine. I'm back onto the table stuff
Feb 09 14:37:45 <ericwill>	so in Table.java, there is a method setParentWindow()
Feb 09 14:38:03 <lufimtse>	:-O
Feb 09 14:38:07 <ericwill>	any widget added as a child of Table/Tree has its z-order mucked with
Feb 09 14:38:17 <lufimtse>	:-O!!!
Feb 09 14:38:22 <lufimtse>	interesting
Feb 09 14:38:25 <lufimtse>	I should investigate
Feb 09 14:38:40 <ericwill>	I would say it's definitely something that affects your tabfolder issue
Feb 09 14:43:46 <lufimtse>	ericwill sir, I bow to you. Commenting out that call fixes the tabfolder regression.
Feb 09 14:43:55 <lufimtse>	:-D
Feb 09 14:43:57 <lufimtse>	life is better.
Feb 09 14:44:11 <ericwill>	:)
Feb 09 14:44:28 <ericwill>	it affects my table issue as well
Feb 09 14:44:28 <lufimtse>	Now why the hell is is there to begin with ha ha. 
Feb 09 14:44:47 <ericwill>	no bloody clue haha
Feb 09 14:45:27 <lufimtse>	with the table editing fix, the 0x0 regression comes to light thou. A control is not seen on gtk2, but seen on gtk3.
Feb 09 14:45:51 <ericwill>	yeah we're going to have to deal with that somehow
Feb 09 14:46:02 <lufimtse>	https://i.imgur.com/DwQG3RX.png  <<< see yellow thing 
Feb 09 14:46:06 <lufimtse>	doesn't show on gtk2
Feb 09 14:46:12 <lufimtse>	will investigate
Feb 09 14:46:20 <lufimtse>	gerrit down, can't rebase on your patch
Feb 09 14:46:20 <lufimtse>	meh
Feb 09 14:46:26 <lufimtse>	oh well
Feb 09 14:46:37 <ericwill>	ah that sucks, forgot that gerrit was down today
Feb 09 14:46:51 *	lufimtse didn't even know it was suppose to be down.
Feb 09 14:47:06 <ericwill>	also does the visible 0x0 text box show up just with tabfolder or does it happen with a plain shell too?
Feb 09 14:47:25 <lufimtse>	let me ttest
Feb 09 14:49:30 <lufimtse>	Without tabfolder, the editing thing is in effect as soon as you start the widget. (I.e, as if you clicked on the first row). But with tabfolder it's a bit off.
Feb 09 14:49:35 <lufimtse>	so still some gimmick going on
Feb 09 14:49:51 <lufimtse>	i.e, without tabfolder it's sort of ok
Feb 09 14:50:10 <lufimtse>	I'll add a few snippets to the JFace repo
Feb 09 14:50:19 <lufimtse>	then we can experiment with various breakagaes
Feb 09 14:50:28 <ericwill>	sounds good, there is clearly more than one issue here
Feb 09 15:12:46 <lufimtse>	I added a few snippets to jFace-Snippets
Feb 09 15:12:55 <lufimtse>	under 'current.broken' package.
Feb 09 15:13:07 <lufimtse>	feel free to add yours also, so I can be mindful of your bugs.
Feb 09 15:13:13 <ericwill>	will do
Feb 09 15:13:27 <lufimtse>	The interesting one is "TabFolder_table_Editing_regression_SWT"
Feb 09 15:18:26 *	lufimtse now using quicksearch for things like 'parent = ' instead of selecting 'write references', as it's faster.
Feb 09 15:18:54 <ericwill>	lol, that quick search plugin is great. so useful
Feb 09 15:20:16 <ericwill>	for this 0x0 issue where the widget is visible, we might want to write some logic to lower those widget's GdkWindows
Feb 09 15:20:20 <ericwill>	food for thought
Feb 09 15:21:01 <lufimtse>	hmm
Feb 09 15:21:30 <lufimtse>	there's a corner case where that wouldn't work, e.g if there are no overlapping widgets
Feb 09 15:21:54 <lufimtse>	0x0 shouldn't be seen, but if it's lowered it's still seen.
Feb 09 15:24:27 <ericwill>	bah
Feb 09 15:24:35 <ericwill>	you are right
Feb 09 16:05:52 <ericwill>	added some snippets to the repo

Feb 16 10:32:16 <lufimtse>	I have a feeling it might be a case where we missunderstood a situation and then became conditioned to think in a certain way.
Feb 16 10:32:21 <lufimtse>	just my thought...
Feb 16 10:32:35 <lufimtse>	like "stuck in a thought box"
Feb 16 10:32:42 <lufimtse>	just mho
Feb 16 10:33:07 <lufimtse>	I might be wrong thou
Feb 16 10:33:16 <lufimtse>	I haven't had my morning coffee yet
Feb 16 10:33:17 <lufimtse>	:-/
Feb 16 10:33:30 <lufimtse>	talking of which ..... 
Feb 16 10:33:34 *	lufimtse goes to get coffee
Feb 16 10:34:38 <ericwill>	it could be, but don't forget
Feb 16 10:34:54 <ericwill>	GTK calls like gtk_widget_get_preferred_size() use CSS theme sizing to take into account stuff
Feb 16 10:35:23 <ericwill>	I am just against putting us in a situation where we get bug reports and end up having to support every person's theme in some way
Feb 16 10:35:27 <ericwill>	this is really unsustainable
Feb 16 10:36:07 <ericwill>	I already went through that song and dance with Andrey for system colors and now the system color parsing code is quite complicated
Feb 16 10:36:34 <ericwill>	all I am saying is that these changes become exponentially difficult to maintain as time goes on
Feb 16 10:37:09 <lufimtse>	we're talking about 7 css properties here :-/ 
Feb 16 10:37:24 <lufimtse>	but good point
Feb 16 10:37:27 <lufimtse>	about warnings
Feb 16 10:37:33 <lufimtse>	do they popup without those properties?
Feb 16 10:38:10 <ericwill>	it's more the number themes, not the properties
Feb 16 10:38:14 <ericwill>	right now we have 2
Feb 16 10:38:28 <ericwill>	as soon as someone comes with a third one then it becomes trickier
Feb 16 10:38:35 <ericwill>	also the warnings are unrelated IIRC
Feb 16 10:38:54 <lufimtse>	I think you might still be in the box. It's not about supporting all other themes, it's about not breaking all other themes.
Feb 16 10:38:57 <lufimtse>	mho
Feb 16 10:39:08 <lufimtse>	thhhhiiinnnkkk about it.
Feb 16 10:39:19 <lufimtse>	ok, we can agree to dissagree, let's talk on tuesday
Feb 16 10:39:24 <ericwill>	I know, but it introduces stuff like "if this theme, do x"
Feb 16 10:39:34 <ericwill>	what will stop someone from saying "can you do the same thing for my theme"
Feb 16 10:39:40 <lufimtse>	well, that's what we're already doing
Feb 16 10:39:43 <lufimtse>	with 7 properties
Feb 16 10:39:54 <lufimtse>	meh
Feb 16 10:39:56 <lufimtse>	ok, 
Feb 16 10:39:57 <lufimtse>	idk
Feb 16 10:40:02 <lufimtse>	tuesday
Feb 16 10:40:09 <ericwill>	yeah, I want to hear what Alex has to say too
Feb 16 10:40:18 <ericwill>	he was more against it than me IIRC
Feb 16 10:40:26 <lufimtse>	I think he's also in a box.
Feb 16 10:59:07 <lufimtse>	hey
Feb 16 10:59:28 <ericwill>	yo
Feb 16 10:59:51 <lufimtse>	is there emotional interest in the css business for you?
Feb 16 10:59:59 <lufimtse>	I kinda have a feeling you're taking it a bit personal :-/
Feb 16 11:00:02 <lufimtse>	wdyt?
Feb 16 11:00:48 <ericwill>	not really personally just I take issue with the way this is all being raised
Feb 16 11:00:58 <ericwill>	I worked closely with Andrey to fix the system colors parsing
Feb 16 11:01:15 <ericwill>	and even that was pushing it as his theme had all sorts of non-standard stuff in it
Feb 16 11:01:41 <ericwill>	I just fear that letting people's custom themes dictate stuff is going to end with unmaintainable code
Feb 16 11:02:11 <lufimtse>	again, I don't think the problem is maintaing other people's themes. That's not the point. They can maintain it themselfes
Feb 16 11:02:12 <ericwill>	especially with sizing
Feb 16 11:02:40 <lufimtse>	The point is not to hard-code to our theme.
Feb 16 11:02:51 <lufimtse>	alex pointed out the 23 thing
Feb 16 11:02:56 <lufimtse>	etc...
Feb 16 11:05:57 <ericwill>	idk we'll see, let's discuss at the next meeting
Feb 16 11:09:49 <lufimtse>	On the side: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_activity.cgi?id=531222

Feb 16 12:19:57 *	Disconnected (Connection timed out)
Feb 16 13:18:56 <ericwill>	so after thinking about it some more I'm okay with doing something like "if adwaita do x" provided it's very clear that we only do that for adwaita
Feb 16 13:19:10 <ericwill>	i.e. we won't do "if <my special theme> do x"
Feb 16 13:19:12 <lufimtse>	hmm
Feb 16 13:19:29 <lufimtse>	interesting
Feb 16 13:19:40 <ericwill>	that way we won't break other people's themes but we also send the message that if someone is using a custom theme, they are responsible for it
Feb 16 13:19:56 <lufimtse>	that's sounds like a good solution
Feb 16 13:20:21 <lufimtse>	maybe add a adwaita.css theme of sorts.
Feb 16 13:20:28 <ericwill>	but as Alex said let's wait for more info from simeon first
Feb 16 13:20:30 <lufimtse>	and support only on gtk3.20 and above.
Feb 16 13:20:32 <ericwill>	yeah something like that
Feb 16 13:20:38 <lufimtse>	ok
Feb 16 13:20:56 <lufimtse>	yea, I agree. Pending till Simon's shows sign of life.
Feb 16 13:22:05 <ericwill>	:)
Feb 16 13:22:36 <ericwill>	with that, time for lunch
Feb 16 13:46:16 <lufimtse>	java mission control uses swt + javafx

Feb 16 13:46:19 <lufimtse>	interesting
Feb 16 13:46:25 <lufimtse>	been reading this guy:
Feb 16 13:46:26 <lufimtse>	http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/283
Feb 16 13:47:55 <ericwill>	yeah I saw that
Feb 16 13:47:58 <ericwill>	it's part of java9
Feb 16 13:48:15 <ericwill>	interesting indeed
