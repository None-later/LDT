Jun 23 13:07:50 <ericwill>	what's up?
Jun 23 13:07:56 <lufimtse>	Investigating.
Jun 23 13:08:15 <lufimtse>	Have you considered the deep copy issues assosiated with cloning an event?
Jun 23 13:08:29 <ericwill>	I was thinking we should enlist someone with win32 to test it
Jun 23 13:09:13 <ericwill>	hmm I don't think it should be an issue
Jun 23 13:09:20 <ericwill>	GTK does something similar
Jun 23 13:09:21 <lufimtse>	DnDEvent?
Jun 23 13:09:29 <lufimtse>	well, Gtk has structs
Jun 23 13:09:35 <lufimtse>	one event = 1 struct
Jun 23 13:09:43 <lufimtse>	thinking...
Jun 23 13:11:06 <ericwill>	I think it was more designed for the use case in the bugzilla comment
Jun 23 13:11:10 <ericwill>	not necessarily for all cases
Jun 23 13:12:44 <lufimtse>	Well, but having it in Event means it's present in DNDEvent also.
Jun 23 13:14:19 <ericwill>	okay, you investigate. maybe test it on cocoa too?
