Mar 05 13:23:03 <lufimtse>	I looked at your jni code
Mar 05 13:23:05 <lufimtse>	interesting
Mar 05 13:23:37 <lufimtse>	in SWT we usually keep almost everything in java land
Mar 05 13:23:52 <lufimtse>	like we get C pointers into Java and then do the conversion of gVariants etc.. on the java side
Mar 05 13:24:01 <lufimtse>	but I guess that's kinda complicated for just a shim.
Mar 05 13:24:14 <lufimtse>	but if you need any gdbus/jni support from SWT, we could certainly investigate such support.
Mar 05 13:24:54 <lufimtse>	The reason we keep things in java land is because debugging the C part of a JVM is kinda complicated.
Mar 05 13:25:05 <lufimtse>	one has to attach debugger etc..
Mar 05 13:25:31 <lufimtse>	in SWT we already have the gvariant builder commands etc...
