Oct 18 14:47:47 <lufimtse>	hey
Oct 18 14:48:54 <dbhole>	Hey Leo, whats up?
Oct 18 14:50:11 <lufimtse>	to answer your email
Oct 18 14:50:12 <lufimtse>	rpm -qf /usr/lib/jvm-exports/jre-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64
Oct 18 14:50:12 <lufimtse>	error: file /usr/lib/jvm-exports/jre-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64: No such file or directory
Oct 18 14:50:18 <lufimtse>	nothing in there
Oct 18 14:50:45 <dbhole>	What command are they trying to run? It is weird that there is a conflict when there is nothing on the system. Are they trying to install both at once?
Oct 18 14:51:02 <dbhole>	what does 'rpm -qa | grep -i openjdk' say?
Oct 18 14:51:24 <lufimtse>	hmm. I'm wondering, do we generally support RHEL 6+ multiple openJDK versions?
Oct 18 14:51:33 <lufimtse>	like if we get this working, is that supported?
Oct 18 14:52:06 <dbhole>	oh, for 6, no.. only 7 and up
Oct 18 14:52:18 <dbhole>	that would explain why you are having the issue
Oct 18 14:52:34 <lufimtse>	ok. My note was that it works on RHEL 7 and on RHEL 6 I was getting transaction error
Oct 18 14:52:53 <lufimtse>	"Works on RHEL 7 (as per kb) but on RHEL 6 it throws rpm package conflicts. if I try to install."
Oct 18 14:53:09 <lufimtse>	sorry for ambiduity
Oct 18 14:53:17 <lufimtse>	ambiguity*
Oct 18 14:53:19 <dbhole>	gah, sorry this is what I get for reading too fast and not in detail
Oct 18 14:53:39 <lufimtse>	^_^, thanks for getting back to me thou. It helps to have things clarified.
Oct 18 14:54:32 <dbhole>	np! I replied back to my reply clarifying :)
Oct 18 14:55:57 <lufimtse>	thanks. I'm thinking of writing a Red Hat devel blog post on it. In the EAP/java consulting mailing lists there are a lot of questions on Oracle -> OpenJDK migrations.
Oct 18 15:01:44 <dbhole>	oh, thats too bad that most dont get to us.. would be nice if they emailed java-project if possible
Oct 18 15:09:46 <lufimtse>	btw. Do you know if we  prove *some kind of* support for older minor OpenJDK builds on newest RHEL7s?
Oct 18 15:10:05 <lufimtse>	e.g if they have some kind of issue, would support at least point toward right kbs?
Oct 18 15:10:11 <lufimtse>	or should I ping support for this question?
Oct 18 15:10:26 <lufimtse>	by support I mean 'best effort' and not code level
Oct 18 15:10:42 <dbhole>	nope, none whatsoever.. if the issue is replicatable on latest JDK, definitely we can fix and update, but we cannot update an ollder one, we do not branch on each minor release, only tag and continue
Oct 18 15:11:16 <dbhole>	if there is an issue on an older version, the first thing we ask is to try the latest and see if it happens there.. if it does, the issue is vlosed, if it does, we investigate
Oct 18 15:11:47 <dbhole>	s/vlosed/closed
Oct 18 15:11:49 <lufimtse>	I see
Oct 18 15:16:06 <lufimtse>	that's very helpful. Thank you.
Oct 18 15:16:17 <dbhole>	np
