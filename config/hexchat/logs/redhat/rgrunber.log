Aug 16 10:43:12 <rgrunber>	hey
Aug 16 10:43:19 <lufimtse>	Do you use mylyn much?
Aug 16 10:43:28 <rgrunber>	:P
Aug 16 10:43:32 <rgrunber>	depends on the task
Aug 16 10:43:52 <lufimtse>	I'm working on backporting a patch to 4_6
Aug 16 10:44:02 <lufimtse>	so far we've actually been manually copy & pasting lines of code
Aug 16 10:44:09 <lufimtse>	create new commit for 4_^
Aug 16 10:44:11 <lufimtse>	4_6
Aug 16 10:44:14 <lufimtse>	and push as new commit
Aug 16 10:44:20 <lufimtse>	I'm looking for a better way
Aug 16 10:44:34 <rgrunber>	git cherry-pick ${commit}
Aug 16 10:44:49 <rgrunber>	applies a given commit onto the branch you're on.
Aug 16 10:45:40 <lufimtse>	Ah yea...
Aug 16 10:45:44 <lufimtse>	it creates a *new* commit
Aug 16 10:46:01 <lufimtse>	I guess the trouble was that change id was the same in the way we used to do it.
Aug 16 10:46:08 <lufimtse>	let me give that a try, thank you for suggestion. 
Aug 16 10:46:14 <lufimtse>	MyLyn has button for cherry picking.
Aug 16 10:46:33 <rgrunber>	it does ? i would have thought from the git history view
Aug 16 10:46:56 <lufimtse>	oh, I got it mixed up
Aug 16 10:47:01 <lufimtse>	yes, the history view
Aug 16 10:47:02 <lufimtse>	not mylyn
Aug 16 10:47:16 <lufimtse>	I'm mixing mylyn and eclipse git functionality
Aug 16 11:04:43 <lufimtse>	That worked. I just had to fix up the changeID.

Sep 13 10:15:53 <lufimtse>	Hullo, do you know much about how platform.ui deals with blacktheme colours? ex it is set to COLOR_LIST_BACKGROUND|FOREGROUND, but it seems that the black theme overrides it somewhere
Sep 13 10:16:19 <rgrunber>	don't know anything about that :(
Sep 13 10:16:36 <rgrunber>	sopot might be some help.. or maybe eric
Sep 13 10:17:29 <lufimtse>	I haven't seen Sophot on IRC since yesterday, is he out somewhere, do you know?
Sep 13 10:17:39 <rgrunber>	probably pto

Oct 12 16:36:14 <lufimtse>	The demo camp, is there a specific date that it should fall on, or any time in November? (like end of it..)
Oct 12 16:38:02 <rgrunber>	you could have a look here https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_Neon_2016#Upcoming
Oct 12 16:38:07 <rgrunber>	though there aren't that many..
Oct 12 16:39:06 <lufimtse>	I suppose something like Nov24 should be ok.

May 16 14:07:53 <rgrunber>	i would probably get rid of the slide about the "Meetings". nothing that would really be shocking or a deal breaker :P
May 16 14:35:11 <lufimtse>	rgrunber that's Ian's bits
May 16 14:35:14 <lufimtse>	I was thinking that also
May 16 14:41:11 <lufimtse>	feel free to hack on the presentation, change stuff as you see fit. 
May 16 14:41:22 <lufimtse>	A lot of the stuff was just thrown in or copied from Ian's other presentation
May 16 14:41:30 <lufimtse>	E.g add stuff to Platform.ui section,
May 16 14:41:37 <lufimtse>	maybe talk about the docker/container stuff that you were doing.
May 16 14:42:05 <rgrunber>	they won't be getting to work on it anyways.. so it really wouldn't be of value.
May 16 14:42:32 <lufimtse>	It's more about what we do as a team.
May 16 14:42:46 <lufimtse>	Part of it will be devoted to what they'll be doing
May 16 14:42:54 <lufimtse>	but it's good for them to know what the team does in general also.
May 16 14:43:58 <rgrunber>	there's a lot of stuff that we'd have to mention about Sopot, Matt, Nick, etc.. so basically even with our part, there is so much that wouldn't be mentioned.. 
May 16 16:06:06 <rgrunber>	what is meant by the bullet point "Open Source (Apache license), on slide 5 ? if you mean the license for Eclipse, that would be the EPL :P
May 17 10:23:11 <rgrunber>	fyi https://rgrunber.fedorapeople.org/review-pairs/
May 17 11:12:31 <rgrunber>	have you decided which machine will be used for the slides ?

May 29 16:27:22 <lufimtse>	I have one here
May 29 16:32:27 <rgrunber>	i'll probably end up doing the install tomorrow. once i figure out where to place that box i have.
May 29 16:45:41 <lufimtse>	ok
May 30 10:34:45 <rgrunber>	windows is installing. you'll get your usb stick sooon :P
May 30 10:35:16 <lufimtse>	:-). No rush. I haven't used that usb stick in like 6 months.
