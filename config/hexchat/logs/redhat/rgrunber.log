Aug 16 10:43:19 <lufimtse>	Do you use mylyn much?
Aug 16 10:43:28 <rgrunber>	:P
Aug 16 10:43:32 <rgrunber>	depends on the task
Aug 16 10:43:52 <lufimtse>	I'm working on backporting a patch to 4_6
Aug 16 10:44:02 <lufimtse>	so far we've actually been manually copy & pasting lines of code
Aug 16 10:44:09 <lufimtse>	create new commit for 4_^

Aug 16 10:44:14 <lufimtse>	and push as new commit
Aug 16 10:44:20 <lufimtse>	I'm looking for a better way
Aug 16 10:44:34 <rgrunber>	git cherry-pick ${commit}
Aug 16 10:44:49 <rgrunber>	applies a given commit onto the branch you're on.
Aug 16 10:45:40 <lufimtse>	Ah yea...
Aug 16 10:45:44 <lufimtse>	it creates a *new* commit
Aug 16 10:46:01 <lufimtse>	I guess the trouble was that change id was the same in the way we used to do it.
Aug 16 10:46:08 <lufimtse>	let me give that a try, thank you for suggestion. 
Aug 16 10:46:14 <lufimtse>	MyLyn has button for cherry picking.
Aug 16 10:46:33 <rgrunber>	it does ? i would have thought from the git history view
Aug 16 10:46:56 <lufimtse>	oh, I got it mixed up
Aug 16 10:47:01 <lufimtse>	yes, the history view
Aug 16 10:47:02 <lufimtse>	not mylyn
Aug 16 10:47:16 <lufimtse>	I'm mixing mylyn and eclipse git functionality
Aug 16 11:04:43 <lufimtse>	That worked. I just had to fix up the changeID.
