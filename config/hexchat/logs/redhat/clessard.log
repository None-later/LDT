Aug 10 10:48:10 <lufimtse_>	Kinda curious, what tennant issue do you have?
Aug 10 10:53:27 <clessard>	ahh sorry, i should have posted it here :) 
Aug 10 10:53:57 <clessard>	well, as mentioned, i have two new roomates who replaced the ones i signed my current lease with. theyre subleting and planned on continuing on for the comign year
Aug 10 11:00:07 <lufimtse_>	hey
Aug 10 11:00:28 <lufimtse_>	I think the law states 1.5% increase per year without approval from the board.
Aug 10 11:00:41 <lufimtse_>	if more than 1.5%,then she needs approval from the board and justify why the price hike
Aug 10 11:00:50 <lufimtse_>	Let me see if I can find sources.
Aug 10 11:01:54 <lufimtse_>	we have: https://www.ontario.ca/page/rent-increase-guideline
Aug 10 11:02:30 <lufimtse_>	If you have a single lease, then your roommates shouldn't matter (I think?)
Aug 10 11:02:40 <lufimtse_>	how much %% is the 400$ increase?
Aug 10 11:03:01 <lufimtse_>	Btw, where do you live if I may ask? Near the Eglington office or far away?
Aug 10 11:05:08 <clessard>	so im paying 1836 right now, split three ways. my numbers were a bit off. she initially said she wanted 2160 and then (since she mentioned that this is late notice) 2040 was the lowest she woudl go.
Aug 10 11:05:13 <clessard>	i live in kensington market fwiw
Aug 10 11:05:18 <clessard>	so thats quite the hike :p
Aug 10 11:05:34 <clessard>	i thought the roomate thing was strange as well.
Aug 10 11:07:45 <lufimtse_>	I think she can only increase to 1872 at most. (this would be 2%). 
Aug 10 11:07:50 <lufimtse_>	But consider calling: 1-416-645-8080 (in the Toronto area)
Aug 10 11:08:00 <lufimtse_>	or email: ltb@ontario.ca
Aug 10 11:08:42 <lufimtse_>	If she wants to impose higher rent, then you could dispute the hike and request that she get's approval.
Aug 10 11:08:51 <lufimtse_>	but I would first become expert on this before doing so :-)
Aug 10 11:09:01 <clessard>	good call, thanks for your help :)
Aug 10 11:10:51 <lufimtse_>	fwiw, If things go sour and you decide to move out of your current place, I've been thinking of moving into some shared accommodation (like 2 bedroom) near Eglington office. I currently rent a studio one subway station south of office. 
Aug 10 11:12:03 <clessard>	cool, thanks, ill keep it in mind :)
Aug 10 11:12:13 <clessard>	its certainly quite last minute given that my lease ends after this month .. 
Aug 10 12:05:36 <lufimtse_>	Derp.
Aug 10 12:05:56 <lufimtse_>	She does need to give you 90 days notice thou
Aug 10 12:06:02 <lufimtse_>	she can't just hike it.
Aug 10 12:06:16 <lufimtse_>	official notice, like with letter and all.
Aug 10 12:06:23 <lufimtse_>	verbal you can throw out the window.
Aug 10 12:07:11 <clessard>	ill see with her. unfortunately this might be one of those situations where a slightly higher increase is worth avoidign that hassle of being in an argumetn with her .. 
Aug 10 14:28:05 <lufimtse_>	lol, she's probably exploiting htat
