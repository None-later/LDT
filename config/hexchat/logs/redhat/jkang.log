Sep 21 16:17:11 <jkang>	ouch
Sep 21 16:17:14 <jkang>	hahah....
Sep 21 16:18:05 <jkang>	I guess you weren't kidding about lack of linux knowledge?
Sep 21 16:18:24 <lufimtse>	lols
Sep 21 16:19:59 <jkang>	a lot of the reddit posts/comments in /r/UofT are pretty funny though
Sep 21 16:20:07 <lufimtse>	lol
Sep 21 16:20:08 <lufimtse>	yea
Sep 21 16:20:17 <lufimtse>	Yah, her accent is pretty touch to understand
Sep 21 16:20:35 <lufimtse>	She comes from industry, doesn't have that 'young prof' mind set.
Sep 21 16:20:57 <lufimtse>	Who knows, maybe they'll hire you to do csc209 instead lol :-)
Sep 21 16:21:36 <jkang>	ppft
Sep 21 16:21:43 <jkang>	they'd have to pay me quite a bit...
Sep 21 16:21:58 <lufimtse>	I wonder how much a prof actually makes.
Sep 21 16:24:24 <jkang>	well there are many positions
Sep 21 16:24:30 <jkang>	like part-time/full-time
Sep 21 16:24:39 <jkang>	lecturer/prof
Sep 21 16:24:42 <jkang>	senior prof
Sep 21 16:24:49 <jkang>	blah blah
Sep 21 16:24:59 <jkang>	hard to say
Sep 21 16:25:04 <lufimtse>	hmm
Sep 21 16:25:34 <lufimtse>	Maybe sometime down the road we should do a joint thing and teach csc301 or something lol.
Sep 21 16:25:40 <lufimtse>	X-D
Sep 21 16:25:50 <lufimtse>	btw, I have another thing going on with csc301
Sep 21 16:26:00 <jkang>	I would never want to teach 301 though... isn't that software engineering?
Sep 21 16:26:01 <lufimtse>	maybe a guest lecture on testing in industry
Sep 21 16:26:05 <lufimtse>	yea
Sep 21 16:26:12 <jkang>	I'd rather teach 369 or 469 hahah...
Sep 21 16:26:14 <jkang>	way more fun
Sep 21 16:26:19 <lufimtse>	lots of work X-
Sep 21 16:26:22 <lufimtse>	X-D
Sep 21 16:26:45 <jkang>	the assignments are easier to mark...
Sep 21 16:27:01 <jkang>	less people in the course possibly?
