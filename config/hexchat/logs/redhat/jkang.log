Sep 21 16:18:05 <jkang>	I guess you weren't kidding about lack of linux knowledge?
Sep 21 16:18:24 <lufimtse>	lols
Sep 21 16:19:59 <jkang>	a lot of the reddit posts/comments in /r/UofT are pretty funny though

Sep 21 16:20:08 <lufimtse>	yea
Sep 21 16:20:17 <lufimtse>	Yah, her accent is pretty touch to understand
Sep 21 16:20:35 <lufimtse>	She comes from industry, doesn't have that 'young prof' mind set.
Sep 21 16:20:57 <lufimtse>	Who knows, maybe they'll hire you to do csc209 instead lol :-)
Sep 21 16:21:36 <jkang>	ppft
Sep 21 16:21:43 <jkang>	they'd have to pay me quite a bit...
Sep 21 16:21:58 <lufimtse>	I wonder how much a prof actually makes.
Sep 21 16:24:24 <jkang>	well there are many positions
Sep 21 16:24:30 <jkang>	like part-time/full-time
Sep 21 16:24:39 <jkang>	lecturer/prof
Sep 21 16:24:42 <jkang>	senior prof
Sep 21 16:24:49 <jkang>	blah blah
Sep 21 16:24:59 <jkang>	hard to say
Sep 21 16:25:04 <lufimtse>	hmm
Sep 21 16:25:34 <lufimtse>	Maybe sometime down the road we should do a joint thing and teach csc301 or something lol.
Sep 21 16:25:40 <lufimtse>	X-D
Sep 21 16:25:50 <lufimtse>	btw, I have another thing going on with csc301
Sep 21 16:26:00 <jkang>	I would never want to teach 301 though... isn't that software engineering?
Sep 21 16:26:01 <lufimtse>	maybe a guest lecture on testing in industry
Sep 21 16:26:05 <lufimtse>	yea
Sep 21 16:26:12 <jkang>	I'd rather teach 369 or 469 hahah...
Sep 21 16:26:14 <jkang>	way more fun
Sep 21 16:26:19 <lufimtse>	lots of work X-
Sep 21 16:26:22 <lufimtse>	X-D
Sep 21 16:26:45 <jkang>	the assignments are easier to mark...

Nov 07 16:53:07 <jkang>	I searched online about the JNI UTF-8 thing. Seems like a pretty old design choice but kind of funny now. I don't think there's much you can do to change it :\
Nov 07 16:53:23 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Nov 07 16:53:25 <lufimtse>	Life sucks
Nov 07 16:53:39 <jkang>	I think the best way to handle it is not use JNI for passing Strings around. Leave it as bytes and then encode/decode when you need it.
Nov 07 16:54:03 <lufimtse>	Yea, I've been gravitating into that direction. Now I'm fiddling around on how to best convert to bytes and back.
Nov 07 16:54:15 <jkang>	Java side it's pretty easy... C side iunno
Nov 07 16:54:29 <lufimtse>	I found a git repo 
Nov 07 16:54:29 <lufimtse>	https://github.com/crazymaik/bitbrothers-jnistringencoding/blob/master/jni/jnistrings.cpp
Nov 07 16:54:37 <jkang>	I'm sure there's libraries around to handle this hahah
Nov 07 16:54:39 <lufimtse>	The guy talks about it
Nov 07 16:54:39 <lufimtse>	http://bitbrothers.org/blog/2013/08/jni-strings-modified-utf8-oh-my/
Nov 07 16:55:44 <jkang>	It's not too hard to write a few helper methods for this... but I guess it would be nice if JNI didn't use modified utf-8
Nov 07 16:56:40 <lufimtse>	Yea, it's like I've spent a fair bit of time learning how to deal with strings in JNI. then I've found that the modified JNI-UTF-8 screws people over, then I've learned that you have to hack around it via bytes[] etc...
Nov 07 16:56:43 <lufimtse>	like why...
Nov 07 16:57:01 <jkang>	Hahah...
Nov 07 16:57:02 <lufimtse>	there doesn't seem to be a good reason for having a custom utf
Nov 07 16:58:03 <jkang>	here it explains a bit about the format: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni/spec/types.html#wp16542
Nov 07 16:58:26 <jkang>	"This means that modified UTF-8 strings never have embedded nulls."
Nov 07 16:58:39 <jkang>	If normal UTF-8 strings have embedded nulls it would simply not work in C
Nov 07 16:58:53 <jkang>	when using standard libraries that rely on null terminators
Nov 07 16:59:23 <jkang>	Well... Iunno hahah
Nov 07 16:59:39 <lufimtse>	"This means that modified UTF-8 strings never have embedded nulls."  <<<< meh?
Nov 07 16:59:40 <jkang>	I may be misthinking null means null terminator
Nov 07 17:00:56 <jkang>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Modified_UTF-8
Nov 07 17:00:58 <jkang>	yeah I was right
Nov 07 17:01:13 <jkang>	it's also significantly faster
Nov 07 17:03:08 <jkang>	e.g. strlen computes length of string up to but not including first null character
Nov 07 17:03:25 <jkang>	a modified utf-8 string with embedded nulls would not have the correct length output by strlen
Nov 07 17:03:28 <jkang>	er
Nov 07 17:03:32 <jkang>	a standard utf-8 string
Nov 07 17:03:42 <jkang>	a modified utf-8 string doesn't have this issue
Nov 07 17:03:50 <jkang>	there are never null characters in the middle of the string
Nov 07 17:04:17 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Nov 07 17:04:21 <lufimtse>	I c
Nov 07 17:04:29 <lufimtse>	but why not support the 4th byte
Nov 07 17:23:40 <jkang>	Because then there would be the possibility of a String having null inside it.

Dec 05 11:42:32 <jkang>	lufimtse, https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en suggests you can use "" for an exact word or phrase. You sure that doesn't do what you need?
Dec 05 11:42:45 <lufimtse>	hey
Dec 05 11:46:35 <lufimtse>	it's all lies: https://i.imgur.com/JH4rmjn.png
Dec 05 11:46:47 <lufimtse>	quoted stings find in-eact matches.
Dec 05 11:48:35 <lufimtse>	in-exact*
Dec 05 11:49:39 <jkang>	It's exact but not case sensitive...
Dec 05 11:51:51 <jkang>	google search is not case sensitive for ux and performance reasons; I wish they had an option to force case sensitivity but in practice I'd use it maybe once in a million searches
Dec 05 11:52:08 <lufimtse>	not case sensitivity
Dec 05 11:52:18 <lufimtse>	word ordering
Dec 05 11:52:40 <jkang>	in your imgur the word order is correct...
Dec 05 11:52:42 <lufimtse>	sec,
Dec 05 11:52:43 <lufimtse>	derp.
Dec 05 11:52:50 <jkang>	level debug menu == level Debug menu
Dec 05 11:53:03 <jkang>	=~
Dec 05 11:54:50 <lufimtse>	ah,
Dec 05 11:54:59 <lufimtse>	I think it's hard to exclude stuff
Dec 05 11:55:06 <lufimtse>	from certain lists
Dec 05 11:55:08 <lufimtse>	e.g:
Dec 05 11:55:10 <lufimtse>	1) Linux
Dec 05 11:55:12 <lufimtse>	2) Win
Dec 05 11:55:12 <jkang>	some people say it doesn't work for them though
Dec 05 11:55:15 <lufimtse>	3) OS X
Dec 05 11:55:28 <lufimtse>	Now I want Linux list not to contain Win32, Cocoa
Dec 05 11:55:36 <lufimtse>	and simmilar for win32/cocoa.
Dec 05 11:55:52 <lufimtse>	so I have to say linux AND NOT (win OR COCOA)
Dec 05 11:55:55 <lufimtse>	etc...
Dec 05 11:56:04 <lufimtse>	say I have 5 mutually exclusive categories
Dec 05 11:56:07 <lufimtse>	things blow up.
Dec 05 11:56:39 <jkang>	it's still capable, if tedious. They really need a 'don't process additional filters' function
Dec 05 11:56:48 <lufimtse>	yea,
Dec 05 11:57:08 <lufimtse>	the filters are basically processed in parralel. I guess to allow them to do it by different cpu's ...
Dec 05 11:57:39 <jkang>	mm.. testing suggest they are sequential in order of their definition, but will always run no matter what
Dec 05 11:57:56 <jkang>	otherwise you can't filter A: star mail X, filter B: archive starred mail
Dec 05 11:58:07 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Dec 05 11:58:18 <lufimtse>	now try to re-arrange your filters :-)
Dec 05 11:58:26 <jkang>	and people have funny 'hacks' for 'apply label X' -> 'drop label X, apply label Y'
Dec 05 11:58:43 <lufimtse>	there isn't a way to re-arrange filters, or name them for instance.
Dec 05 11:58:43 <lufimtse>	meh
Dec 05 11:58:52 <lufimtse>	I can live with gmail, but it's not optimal :-)
Dec 05 11:58:56 <lufimtse>	imho
Dec 05 11:58:59 <jkang>	I don't think a name would help...
Dec 05 12:00:46 <jkang>	Yeah I don't think it's optimal. I just want to make sure if things are actually 'not possible' versus 'so hard it might as well be not possible'
Dec 05 12:01:19 <lufimtse>	I'd say the limit 9.
Dec 05 12:01:30 <lufimtse>	is*
Dec 05 12:01:35 <lufimtse>	at 10 we start to loose track
Dec 05 12:01:40 <lufimtse>	so 3 * 3 = 9 -> ok.
Dec 05 12:01:48 <lufimtse>	4 mutually exclusive categories -> brain meh.
Dec 05 12:02:10 <lufimtse>	unless u r Jie, then you can probably go to 5 mutually exclusive categories.
Dec 05 12:03:10 <jkang>	I'm curious how many people in that mailing list are interested in 'all' the operating system specific e-mails
Dec 05 12:03:24 <jkang>	versus only one, or only two
Dec 05 12:04:08 <lufimtse>	well, kinda hard to exclude. New bugs are created where users don't report OS. Just against SWT.
Dec 05 12:04:25 <lufimtse>	We then categorize them.
Dec 05 12:04:43 <lufimtse>	but sometimes I get mentioned in a Win bug like "Leo, does it work on Linux"
Dec 05 12:04:53 <jkang>	if it's in bugzilla what's the point of the mailing list...
Dec 05 12:05:06 <lufimtse>	this is bugzilla sending emails for bug updates.
Dec 05 12:05:20 <lufimtse>	bug updates come into my inbox
Dec 05 12:05:47 <jkang>	submit a patch to bugzilla to allow users more settings for the bug update e-mails :D
Dec 05 12:07:15 <jkang>	interesting; I always found the bug update e-mails to be annoying when I used bugzilla, I just turned them off and checked bugzilla itself
Dec 05 12:07:33 <jkang>	the only ones I would 'keep' are ones that mention me directly
Dec 05 12:07:43 <jkang>	anything else was just fluff..
Dec 05 12:09:20 <lufimtse>	doesn't work that well for SWT. I need to be aware of stuff. Like if a user reports a JVM crash, it might be related to my area of work
Dec 05 12:13:27 <jkang>	so... it sounds like you'd then want to read all e-mails... what's the point of categorizing them then?
Dec 05 12:15:28 <lufimtse>	jkang well, I label them so I can see which one are more importand and which are less
Dec 05 12:15:55 <lufimtse>	https://i.imgur.com/lmNjuqi.png
Dec 05 12:16:11 <lufimtse>	team emails are labeled, when I'm mentioned there's a 'Leo' label.
Dec 05 12:16:28 <lufimtse>	which is annoying as there is a "Leo Pong" in our company, which sometimes is categorized as me.
Dec 05 12:16:45 <lufimtse>	if he writes on memo list etc..
Dec 05 12:17:04 <lufimtse>	also, for memo list, I'd like threads to be more visible that i've replied to in.
Dec 05 12:17:10 <lufimtse>	as an example
Dec 05 12:17:15 <lufimtse>	having a label makes it easier to find those.
Dec 05 12:25:18 <jkang>	memo list eh
Dec 05 12:28:17 <lufimtse>	yea.
