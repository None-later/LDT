Sep 21 16:17:11 <jkang>	ouch
Sep 21 16:17:14 <jkang>	hahah....
Sep 21 16:18:05 <jkang>	I guess you weren't kidding about lack of linux knowledge?
Sep 21 16:18:24 <lufimtse>	lols
Sep 21 16:19:59 <jkang>	a lot of the reddit posts/comments in /r/UofT are pretty funny though
Sep 21 16:20:07 <lufimtse>	lol
Sep 21 16:20:08 <lufimtse>	yea
Sep 21 16:20:17 <lufimtse>	Yah, her accent is pretty touch to understand
Sep 21 16:20:35 <lufimtse>	She comes from industry, doesn't have that 'young prof' mind set.
Sep 21 16:20:57 <lufimtse>	Who knows, maybe they'll hire you to do csc209 instead lol :-)
Sep 21 16:21:36 <jkang>	ppft
Sep 21 16:21:43 <jkang>	they'd have to pay me quite a bit...
Sep 21 16:21:58 <lufimtse>	I wonder how much a prof actually makes.
Sep 21 16:24:24 <jkang>	well there are many positions
Sep 21 16:24:30 <jkang>	like part-time/full-time
Sep 21 16:24:39 <jkang>	lecturer/prof
Sep 21 16:24:42 <jkang>	senior prof
Sep 21 16:24:49 <jkang>	blah blah
Sep 21 16:24:59 <jkang>	hard to say
Sep 21 16:25:04 <lufimtse>	hmm
Sep 21 16:25:34 <lufimtse>	Maybe sometime down the road we should do a joint thing and teach csc301 or something lol.
Sep 21 16:25:40 <lufimtse>	X-D
Sep 21 16:25:50 <lufimtse>	btw, I have another thing going on with csc301
Sep 21 16:26:00 <jkang>	I would never want to teach 301 though... isn't that software engineering?
Sep 21 16:26:01 <lufimtse>	maybe a guest lecture on testing in industry
Sep 21 16:26:05 <lufimtse>	yea
Sep 21 16:26:12 <jkang>	I'd rather teach 369 or 469 hahah...
Sep 21 16:26:14 <jkang>	way more fun
Sep 21 16:26:19 <lufimtse>	lots of work X-
Sep 21 16:26:22 <lufimtse>	X-D
Sep 21 16:26:45 <jkang>	the assignments are easier to mark...
Sep 21 16:27:01 <jkang>	less people in the course possibly?

Nov 07 16:53:07 <jkang>	I searched online about the JNI UTF-8 thing. Seems like a pretty old design choice but kind of funny now. I don't think there's much you can do to change it :\
Nov 07 16:53:23 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Nov 07 16:53:25 <lufimtse>	Life sucks
Nov 07 16:53:39 <jkang>	I think the best way to handle it is not use JNI for passing Strings around. Leave it as bytes and then encode/decode when you need it.
Nov 07 16:54:03 <lufimtse>	Yea, I've been gravitating into that direction. Now I'm fiddling around on how to best convert to bytes and back.
Nov 07 16:54:15 <jkang>	Java side it's pretty easy... C side iunno
Nov 07 16:54:29 <lufimtse>	I found a git repo 
Nov 07 16:54:29 <lufimtse>	https://github.com/crazymaik/bitbrothers-jnistringencoding/blob/master/jni/jnistrings.cpp
Nov 07 16:54:37 <jkang>	I'm sure there's libraries around to handle this hahah
Nov 07 16:54:39 <lufimtse>	The guy talks about it
Nov 07 16:54:39 <lufimtse>	http://bitbrothers.org/blog/2013/08/jni-strings-modified-utf8-oh-my/
Nov 07 16:55:44 <jkang>	It's not too hard to write a few helper methods for this... but I guess it would be nice if JNI didn't use modified utf-8
Nov 07 16:56:40 <lufimtse>	Yea, it's like I've spent a fair bit of time learning how to deal with strings in JNI. then I've found that the modified JNI-UTF-8 screws people over, then I've learned that you have to hack around it via bytes[] etc...
Nov 07 16:56:43 <lufimtse>	like why...
Nov 07 16:57:01 <jkang>	Hahah...
Nov 07 16:57:02 <lufimtse>	there doesn't seem to be a good reason for having a custom utf
Nov 07 16:58:03 <jkang>	here it explains a bit about the format: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni/spec/types.html#wp16542
Nov 07 16:58:26 <jkang>	"This means that modified UTF-8 strings never have embedded nulls."
Nov 07 16:58:39 <jkang>	If normal UTF-8 strings have embedded nulls it would simply not work in C
Nov 07 16:58:53 <jkang>	when using standard libraries that rely on null terminators
Nov 07 16:59:23 <jkang>	Well... Iunno hahah
Nov 07 16:59:39 <lufimtse>	"This means that modified UTF-8 strings never have embedded nulls."  <<<< meh?
Nov 07 16:59:40 <jkang>	I may be misthinking null means null terminator
Nov 07 17:00:56 <jkang>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Modified_UTF-8
Nov 07 17:00:58 <jkang>	yeah I was right
Nov 07 17:01:13 <jkang>	it's also significantly faster
Nov 07 17:03:08 <jkang>	e.g. strlen computes length of string up to but not including first null character
Nov 07 17:03:25 <jkang>	a modified utf-8 string with embedded nulls would not have the correct length output by strlen
Nov 07 17:03:28 <jkang>	er
Nov 07 17:03:32 <jkang>	a standard utf-8 string
Nov 07 17:03:42 <jkang>	a modified utf-8 string doesn't have this issue
Nov 07 17:03:50 <jkang>	there are never null characters in the middle of the string
Nov 07 17:04:17 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Nov 07 17:04:21 <lufimtse>	I c
Nov 07 17:04:29 <lufimtse>	but why not support the 4th byte
Nov 07 17:23:40 <jkang>	Because then there would be the possibility of a String having null inside it.
Nov 08 10:27:36 <lufimtse>	hey
