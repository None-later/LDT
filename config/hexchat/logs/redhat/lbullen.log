May 29 10:18:09 <lufimtse>	Ok, gimmmee 20 mins, I just need to do my status report
May 29 10:18:27 <lbullen>	should I also be adding to that email chain?
May 29 10:25:07 <lufimtse>	Status report?
May 29 10:25:07 <lufimtse>	yea
May 29 10:25:18 <lufimtse>	Just mention briefly what you've worked on.
May 29 10:25:22 <lufimtse>	High level, avoid details :-)

May 29 12:25:01 <lufimtse>	kewl
May 29 12:25:16 <lbullen>	Do I say it depends on or blocks the other bug?
May 29 12:25:38 <lufimtse>	blocks. I set it
May 29 12:25:47 <lufimtse>	blocks = it prevents the other bug from being closed
May 29 12:25:53 <lbullen>	Ok thanks
May 29 12:26:01 <lufimtse>	depends on = this bug cannot be fixed until the other bug is fixed
May 29 12:26:11 <lufimtse>	parents -> depend on -> children. 
May 29 12:26:15 <lufimtse>	children -> block> parents
May 29 12:38:08 <lufimtse>	When ever I ask Roland for help, he usually goes into detail. Like I ask him how to tie my shoes, He'll explain the theory of how to make a shoe. I now see why he goes into detail lol. When you have your own intern, you'll see X-D.

Jun 06 15:44:45 <lbullen>	Have you used SWTBot?
Jun 06 15:44:55 <lufimtse>	nein
Jun 06 15:45:06 <lufimtse>	but the intern who taught me did.
Jun 06 15:45:10 <lufimtse>	but he's not here anymore
Jun 06 15:45:20 <lufimtse>	afaik it's a bit unstable
Jun 06 15:45:22 <lufimtse>	but works
Jun 06 15:45:42 <lbullen>	would you have any idea how to install it/set it up?
Jun 06 15:53:36 <lufimtse>	hmmm
Jun 06 15:53:51 <lufimtse>	you can install it from the install software mechanism
Jun 06 15:54:07 <lufimtse>	lbullen and then we have vogell
Jun 06 15:54:08 <lufimtse>	a
Jun 06 15:54:09 <lufimtse>	http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/SWTBot/article.html
Jun 06 15:54:29 <lufimtse>	I would read through that
Jun 06 15:54:43 <lufimtse>	maybe hunt through platform.ui source code to find example usages of swtbot
Jun 06 15:55:09 <lufimtse>	https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/
Jun 06 15:55:15 <lufimtse>	grep for SWTBot
Jun 06 15:56:12 <lbullen>	I did, guess its less of a SWTBot problem, but after I install what it says, I go into the project, add the import lines and they do not resolve. Trying to add them to the project dependencies, they still dont show up
Jun 06 15:56:31 <lufimtse>	try swtbot sdk
Jun 06 15:56:56 <lufimtse>	if there is one
Jun 06 16:00:39 <lufimtse>	any luck?
Jun 06 16:00:45 <lbullen>	no
Jun 06 16:00:51 <lufimtse>	is there an sdk?
Jun 06 16:09:19 <lbullen>	Ok, I just tried a pile of things and was able to get it included in the project, so will have to see which did it
Jun 06 16:10:40 <lufimtse>	okie
Jun 06 16:10:44 <lufimtse>	let me know if you get stuck

Feb 08 15:01:13 <lufimtse>	I reccomend to first watch all the videos, take paper notes as you go along. Then read the book and take more accurate notes. What you'll notice is that in later chapters they explain a lot of stuff that is wtf in earlier chapters and you get a better feel for what's important.
Feb 08 15:01:41 <lufimtse>	with the initial notes, I wouldn't focus so much on the details, just make sure you understand the concepts etc..
Feb 08 15:01:57 <lbullen>	Ok thanks
Feb 08 15:05:29 <lufimtse>	As a note, I think all the interns who failed the exam the first time didn't take the exam again (9/10 failed). I think I was the only one to try again and pass the 2nd time around. I wouldn't get too discouraged if you fail exam first time around, just try again. 2nd time around you have a better understanding of what to do on the exam. It's like drivers test.
Feb 08 15:06:22 <lbullen>	Ya, I intend on getting the certification
