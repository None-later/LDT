Jun 26 17:32:35 <lufimtse>	recently?
Jun 26 17:33:08 <lufimtse>	How did you sign up for it? (Like what's the proceedure for Red Hat employees?)
Jun 26 17:34:59 <nboldt>	https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-181005
Jun 26 17:35:41 <nboldt>	have to log in via that page and link to https://training-lms.redhat.com/Saml/AuthRequest?sitename=redhatint so you can sign up without having to provide a credit card
Jun 26 17:38:40 <nboldt>	hope that helps! not a lot of available in-class options for these courses/exams.
Jun 26 17:38:44 <nboldt>	RHCE is only 2x a year

Nov 28 11:21:51 <lufimtse>	hey
Nov 28 11:22:04 <lufimtse>	we have "Eclipse Release Train" and "Developer Tools" projects
Nov 28 11:22:27 <lufimtse>	Do we have any use for "Developer Tools" project?
Nov 28 11:22:42 <lufimtse>	Or do all our work in "Eclipse Release Train"
Nov 28 11:23:36 <nboldt>	you tell me
Nov 28 11:24:05 <lufimtse>	lol, dunnow. I created my stuff in Developer tools, but Sopot is asking to have it created in Eclipse Release train
Nov 28 11:24:13 <lufimtse>	so I'm like confused
Nov 28 11:24:24 <nboldt>	I think the idea was that we could track items in ERT ~= Eclipse Bugzilla, RHBZ ~= Red Hat Bugzilla... and anything related to devtools which is NOT in those two could be tracked in DevTools
Nov 28 11:24:26 <lufimtse>	if we should work in ERT, why keep dev tools around?
Nov 28 11:24:43 <nboldt>	eg., RCM tickets?
Nov 28 11:24:48 <lufimtse>	RCM?
Nov 28 11:25:03 <nboldt>	yeah like https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/RCM-23773
Nov 28 11:25:29 <nboldt>	"Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 11.1.0.GA RPMs available for push to DevTools channel" >> assigned to Radek Zima
Nov 28 11:26:30 <lufimtse>	no ah
Nov 28 11:26:37 <lufimtse>	ignore "no"
Nov 28 11:26:39 <lufimtse>	ah, <<
Nov 28 11:26:40 <lufimtse>	I see
Nov 28 11:26:56 <nboldt>	:)
Nov 28 11:27:12 <nboldt>	(reason #1 why I hate IRC: no editing of typos)
Nov 28 11:27:19 <nboldt>	(reason #2: requires VPN)
Nov 28 11:27:30 <lufimtse>	yea, irc is meh
Nov 28 11:27:32 <nboldt>	(reason #3: no emojis and gifs)
Nov 28 11:27:44 <lufimtse>	is there a way to move tasks between projects?
Nov 28 11:28:00 <nboldt>	yes, if you're an admin in both I think you can move them
Nov 28 11:28:05 <nboldt>	give me a link 
Nov 28 11:28:27 <lufimtse>	ah, I think I can move them
Nov 28 11:29:12 <nboldt>	ok cool
Nov 28 11:29:56 <nboldt>	in the past ERT issues have simply been dupes of BZ, but if Sopot wants us to start creating ERT issues that don't have equivalencies to Eclipse BZ, then ... well, we prolly don't need devtools 
Nov 28 11:30:25 <nboldt>	meanwhile the python script that scrapes EBZ and RHBZ is still broken - haven't had time yet to investigate
Nov 28 11:36:47 <lufimtse>	nboldt ok
