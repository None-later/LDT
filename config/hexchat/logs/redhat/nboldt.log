Jun 26 17:26:36 <lufimtse>	recently
Jun 26 17:31:40 <nboldt>	nope, I took it a few years ago
Jun 26 17:31:52 <nboldt>	I signed up for RHCE however 
Jun 26 17:32:35 <lufimtse>	recently?
Jun 26 17:33:08 <lufimtse>	How did you sign up for it? (Like what's the proceedure for Red Hat employees?)
Jun 26 17:34:59 <nboldt>	https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-181005
Jun 26 17:35:41 <nboldt>	have to log in via that page and link to https://training-lms.redhat.com/Saml/AuthRequest?sitename=redhatint so you can sign up without having to provide a credit card
Jun 26 17:38:40 <nboldt>	hope that helps! not a lot of available in-class options for these courses/exams.
Jun 26 17:38:44 <nboldt>	RHCE is only 2x a year
Jun 26 17:38:56 <nboldt>	RHCSA is probably more frequent
Jun 27 09:17:43 <lufimtse>	Thank you for links, I was able to enrol :-)

Nov 28 11:21:51 <lufimtse>	hey
Nov 28 11:22:04 <lufimtse>	we have "Eclipse Release Train" and "Developer Tools" projects
Nov 28 11:22:27 <lufimtse>	Do we have any use for "Developer Tools" project?
Nov 28 11:22:42 <lufimtse>	Or do all our work in "Eclipse Release Train"
Nov 28 11:23:36 <nboldt>	you tell me
Nov 28 11:24:05 <lufimtse>	lol, dunnow. I created my stuff in Developer tools, but Sopot is asking to have it created in Eclipse Release train
Nov 28 11:24:13 <lufimtse>	so I'm like confused
Nov 28 11:24:24 <nboldt>	I think the idea was that we could track items in ERT ~= Eclipse Bugzilla, RHBZ ~= Red Hat Bugzilla... and anything related to devtools which is NOT in those two could be tracked in DevTools
Nov 28 11:24:26 <lufimtse>	if we should work in ERT, why keep dev tools around?
Nov 28 11:24:43 <nboldt>	eg., RCM tickets?
Nov 28 11:24:48 <lufimtse>	RCM?
Nov 28 11:25:03 <nboldt>	yeah like https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/RCM-23773
Nov 28 11:25:29 <nboldt>	"Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 11.1.0.GA RPMs available for push to DevTools channel" >> assigned to Radek Zima
Nov 28 11:26:30 <lufimtse>	no ah
Nov 28 11:26:37 <lufimtse>	ignore "no"
Nov 28 11:26:39 <lufimtse>	ah, <<
Nov 28 11:26:40 <lufimtse>	I see
Nov 28 11:26:56 <nboldt>	:)
Nov 28 11:27:12 <nboldt>	(reason #1 why I hate IRC: no editing of typos)
Nov 28 11:27:19 <nboldt>	(reason #2: requires VPN)
Nov 28 11:27:30 <lufimtse>	yea, irc is meh
Nov 28 11:27:32 <nboldt>	(reason #3: no emojis and gifs)
Nov 28 11:27:44 <lufimtse>	is there a way to move tasks between projects?
Nov 28 11:28:00 <nboldt>	yes, if you're an admin in both I think you can move them
Nov 28 11:28:05 <nboldt>	give me a link 
Nov 28 11:28:27 <lufimtse>	ah, I think I can move them
Nov 28 11:29:12 <nboldt>	ok cool
Nov 28 11:29:56 <nboldt>	in the past ERT issues have simply been dupes of BZ, but if Sopot wants us to start creating ERT issues that don't have equivalencies to Eclipse BZ, then ... well, we prolly don't need devtools 
Nov 28 11:30:25 <nboldt>	meanwhile the python script that scrapes EBZ and RHBZ is still broken - haven't had time yet to investigate
Nov 28 11:36:47 <lufimtse>	nboldt ok

Sep 10 09:24:09 <lufimtse>	hey hey
Sep 10 09:24:16 <nboldt>	hey
Sep 10 09:24:20 <lufimtse>	do you know much about JBoss Developer studio :-)
Sep 10 09:24:23 <lufimtse>	?
Sep 10 09:24:31 <nboldt>	never heard of it
Sep 10 09:24:34 <lufimtse>	he he
Sep 10 09:24:43 <nboldt>	is that anything like Red Hat Developer Studio?
Sep 10 09:25:21 <nboldt>	how can I help?
Sep 10 09:25:25 <lufimtse>	I'm taking the jboss courses right now, they're covering "Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio". I'm wondering, is that something we can just run like eclipse or must it be installed?
Sep 10 09:25:43 <lufimtse>	on Fedora
Sep 10 09:26:01 <nboldt>	https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_developer_studio/12.0/html/installation_guide/
Sep 10 09:26:21 <nboldt>	tl;dr: you have to install it on top of Eclipse rpm, or install it from the .jar file
Sep 10 09:26:41 <lufimtse>	So I can't just extract & run like a regular eclipse?
Sep 10 09:26:41 <nboldt>	once installed, yes, you run it like you run eclipse
Sep 10 09:27:01 <nboldt>	no, it's not built like an Eclipse tarball
Sep 10 09:27:13 <lufimtse>	ah ok. 
Sep 10 09:27:19 <nboldt>	it's either an updare site, or a installer.jar that you run w/ java
Sep 10 09:27:23 <lufimtse>	do you run fedora on your system?
Sep 10 09:27:31 <nboldt>	there IS a commandline way to run the installer w/o gui 
Sep 10 09:27:33 <nboldt>	yes
Sep 10 09:27:50 <lufimtse>	how do you recommend installing it, fedora rpm or a different way?
Sep 10 09:28:21 <nboldt>	if you want it self-contained and independent from your other eclipse rpm install
Sep 10 09:28:22 <nboldt>	then...
Sep 10 09:28:23 <nboldt>	https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_developer_studio/12.0/html/installation_guide/proc_installing-devstudio-stand-alone-using-the-installer
Sep 10 09:28:32 <nboldt>	use the installer jar
Sep 10 09:28:56 <nboldt>	but if you want to install it just as a set of features into an existing Eclipse, use Eclipse Marketplace
Sep 10 09:29:09 <nboldt>	https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_developer_studio/12.0/html/installation_guide/assembly_installing-devstudio-in-eclipse#proc_installing-devstudio-in-eclipse-when-online
Sep 10 09:29:11 <lufimtse>	ah, ok.
Sep 10 09:29:18 <nboldt>	both options are valid, just depends on your preference
Sep 10 09:29:34 <nboldt>	installer is a better option for offline (like in RH classrooms and demos)
Sep 10 09:30:47 <nboldt>	marketplace is a better option for online as you get a Devstudio install that also has support for using Eclipse Marketplace; installer does NOT include marketplace support unless you install MPC manually because it's a stripped down Eclipse-based Product 
Sep 10 09:31:12 <lufimtse>	I see.
Sep 10 09:31:28 <lufimtse>	Does dev studio work with latest eclipse or do I need to check out older versions?
Sep 10 09:31:43 <lufimtse>	photon 4.8
Sep 10 09:31:44 <nboldt>	12.latest is built on Photon
Sep 10 09:31:56 <lufimtse>	oki
Sep 10 09:32:00 <nboldt>	12.9.in-progress is built on simrel 4.9
Sep 10 09:32:11 <lufimtse>	ah. Nice.
Sep 10 09:32:45 <lufimtse>	I'll be starting a middlewear project next week with Interac (send money via email). Will be advertising Eclipse/JBoss :-P
Sep 10 09:33:16 <nboldt>	cool
