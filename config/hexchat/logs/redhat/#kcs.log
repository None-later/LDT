Oct 18 10:31:13 <lufimtse>	Hello. A few KB artiles need a few minor updates. Whom do I communicate this to to have the kb's updated? (I'm a consultant on site, I generally can't take the time to edit the kbs myself unfortunatley). 
Oct 18 10:31:21 <lufimtse>	anyone knows?
Oct 18 10:39:26 <jawatts>	sofia++
Oct 18 10:39:26 <robotnik>	sofia has 330 points of karma (rank 923)
Oct 18 10:40:44 <jawatts>	lufimtse you can add a comment or private comment at the bottom of the solution, but that is not a guarenteed response. I would suggest adding a private comment and then emailing the SBR identified in the metadata at the bottom.

Oct 18 10:43:50 <lufimtse>	jawatts, what's an SBR? e.g this articles doesn't seem to list an 'SBR' https://access.redhat.com/articles/1299013 
Oct 18 10:48:19 <sofia>	lufimtse you can contact one of the  authors, if you click on the red pen , you will see manage versions
Oct 18 10:48:35 <lufimtse>	sofia, ah, thank you .
Oct 18 10:49:10 <sofia>	there you can see who last "touch" it and ask him to update it 
Oct 18 10:49:27 <lufimtse>	sofia, btw, do you know what SBR stands for? It looks like some kind of group of people of sort. There seem to be many different SBR's: https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-62473
Oct 18 10:52:01 <sofia>	lufimtse yeah as you can see in that mojo page in support we have different groups of engineers that are working on a specific area/product
Oct 18 10:52:20 <lufimtse>	sofia, do you know what 'SBR' stands for?
Oct 18 10:53:51 <jawatts>	lufimtse specialty based routing I believe. or skills, I can never remember.
Oct 18 10:54:08 <sofia>	lufimtse sbr=specialty based routing 
Oct 18 10:54:26 <sofia>	jawatts was faster :)
Oct 18 10:55:02 <lufimtse>	sofia, jawatts thank you ^_^.   Btw, I was also pointed to #wordnerds that seems to be able to figure out what acronyms means.
Oct 18 10:55:52 <sofia>	lufimtse good luck with this..there are so many out there :)
Oct 18 11:07:29 <lesw>	lufimtse, sofia, jawatts, There is a bot called Doepy on #ccs that spells out acronyms. You can learn more here: https://mojo.redhat.com/groups/ccs/blog/2017/03/24/meet-dopey-your-documentation-conventions-advisor
Oct 18 11:07:49 <lesw>	s/Doepy/Dopey
Oct 18 11:09:47 <jawatts>	lesw lufimtse or Acrobot, because we like re-creating tools.
Oct 18 11:10:01 <jawatts>	(/msg Acrobot !help)
Oct 18 11:10:11 <lufimtse>	jawatts, thanks ^_^
