Jul 25 20:03:37 <Creak>	hi!
Jul 25 20:04:10 <Creak>	I'd like to do this kind of layout, but I don't know what's the best way to achieve this: https://www.reddit.com/r/GTK/comments/4ulncl/gtkdev_best_way_to_achieve_this_layout/
Jul 25 20:05:03 <Creak>	my main problem is the width of the cells. First the Grid has to take the whole window, which doesn't seem to work :/
Jul 25 20:05:16 <Creak>	then the two panes must be of the same width

Jul 25 20:05:34 <Creak>	I simply don't know how to achieve that kind of layout

Jul 25 20:40:37 <Company>	Creak: i assume you're not using a scrolledwindow for managing the scrollbar?
Jul 25 20:42:26 <Company>	Creak: because then the answer is to put the 2 text panes into a grid with column-homogeneous = true and then put the grid and the scrollbar into a box
Jul 25 20:46:10 <Creak>	the problem would be for the headers and footers, they must be respectively above and under each pane, but the scrollbar on the right should be the size of the pane without the header and footer
Jul 25 20:46:45 <Creak>	otherwise the scrollbar would seem to include these components which would be quite strange
Jul 25 20:47:21 <Creak>	I tested with a Gtk.Grid and setting the pane to hexpand
Jul 25 20:48:00 <Creak>	it seems to work, but the problem I'm afraid of is that I don't know if both pane will keep the same width all the time
Jul 25 21:35:53 <Creak>	I've got another question. Say you're doing a special widget that is basically an HBox but with specific buttons for your app. Is it better to derive your class from Gtk.Widget and then add an Gtk.HBox or to derive directly from HBox?
Jul 25 21:48:14 <benwaffle>	Creak: you should use Gtk.Box instead of VBox and HBox
Jul 25 21:50:09 <Creak>	yup, I'm already using it, but it was just the habit ;)
Jul 25 22:06:15 <Creak>	my problem now is that my headerbar is taking too much space when the label in it is too long... how can I fix the label width?
Jul 25 22:07:13 <hergertme>	set max-width-chars to something reasonable and/or ellipsize = PANGO_ELLIPSIZE_*
Jul 25 22:21:08 <Creak>	I set ellipsize to MIDDLE, but it didn't change
Jul 25 22:21:16 <Creak>	I'll try max-width-charws
Jul 25 22:23:44 <Creak>	nope... doesn't work...
Jul 25 22:24:22 <Creak>	urgh that's so frustrating to be that close to something that works exactly how you'd expect!
Jul 25 22:55:38 <Creak>	Should I use the "map" or "map-event" signals to prevent my Grid to allocate too much space to the first row cells?
Jul 25 23:30:04 <Creak>	here is an example: http://pastebin.com/P75agP9T
Jul 25 23:32:58 <Creak>	I'd like button1 and button2 to be the same width, and label1 to be the same width as button1. But there, since label1 is way larger than both button1, label1 wins and it is setting the width for the whole column
Jul 26 00:08:39 <Creak>	Found the solution!!! you were right hergertme, I just didn't know how to use these functions. I just have to call label1.set_max_width_chars(1) and label1.set_ellipsize(Pango.EllipsizeMode.START)
Jul 26 00:09:25 <Creak>	this way the cell doesn't get an impossible width
Jul 26 02:28:25 <rishi>	Shouldn't the example my-app-label.c for a derivable class use G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE instead of G_DEFINE_TYPE?
Jul 26 02:28:34 <rishi>	I mean in https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/SubclassGObject
Jul 26 02:39:35 <rishi>	It is even worse.  G_DECLARE_DERIVABLE_TYPE doesn't generate the typedef for MyAppLabelPrivate.
Jul 26 02:39:43 <rishi>	(Why doesn't it do that?)
Jul 26 02:40:11 <rishi>	That means struct _MyAppLabelPrivate needs to be somehow typedef-ed to MyAppLabelPrivate.
Jul 26 03:00:31 <tristan>	rishi, I think that the standard for some years has become to not include a ->priv pointer on the public struct (since the lookup for private data has since become pointer arithmetic)
Jul 26 03:00:58 <tristan>	so you should not need a private struct typedef in the header (where the G_DECLARE_ stuff goes)
Jul 26 03:24:01 <ricotz>	ebassi, hi, a minor graphene issue https://paste.debian.net/plain/785287
Jul 26 03:41:56 <rishi>	tristan: Ok, but the HowDoI is still wrong.

Jul 26 05:36:09 <ebassi>	rudrab: But, in general, you cannot expect stuff to just be sequential in an event-driven GUI toolkit. This is not a console program.

Jul 26 07:36:29 <feborges>	is there a good reason why gtk_button_set_label always creates a new label instead of checking whether it already has one and gtk_label_set_label (GTK_LABEL (gtk_bin_get_child (GTK_BIN (button)... ?

Jul 26 07:38:55 <mclasen>	if you want to control the label widget, set a label widget, and operate on that
Jul 26 07:38:56 <slaf>	thumbnail: if it's a GObject, it's ref-counted so g_object_unref

Jul 26 08:02:34 <The_gull>	is there a way to remove/add multiple children “at the same time” (not causing redraws) to a container ?
Jul 26 08:04:09 <mclasen>	there is no redraw between two calls of container_remove that you do in a row
Jul 26 08:05:16 <The_gull>	mh, that’s good then, thanks :·)
Jul 26 08:06:35 <rudrab>	or i should just call the function inside the if loop as:

Jul 26 08:48:44 <hotcfoch>	is it just enough with defining a propert with g_value_set_uint64 in C, if I want hat property being read as an int in Python?
Jul 26 08:50:38 <feaneron>	i think so
Jul 26 08:51:04 <feaneron>	if python implicitly knows about the unsigned situation of the int

Jul 26 11:34:03 <feaneron>	hi guys, why am I consistently always receiving a <Meta> key in Wayland?
Jul 26 11:34:35 <feaneron>	whenever I check for the key presses, there's this stray <Meta> modified, and I have no idea where does it come from
Jul 26 11:40:15 <mclasen>	not  a stray key, just a stray modifier
Jul 26 11:40:44 <mclasen>	probably due to the fact that meta is colocated with some other modifier
Jul 26 11:41:02 <mclasen>	if wayland hadn't inherited xkb from X, the world would be a better place...
Jul 26 11:41:15 <feaneron>	shall I fill a bug for that?
Jul 26 11:41:34 <mclasen>	no, why ?
Jul 26 11:44:20 <feaneron>	because that modifier shouldn't be there. Or should it?
Jul 26 11:44:55 *	jjongsma_ is now known as jjongsma
Jul 26 11:45:24 <mclasen>	it being there is a reflection of the xkb configuration, if my assumption is correct
Jul 26 11:45:45 <mclasen>	you could debug this some more, certainly
Jul 26 11:46:09 <jjongsma>	ebassi, any chance you have a little time to talk about a regression we have in spice-gtk caused by https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=2c7b21718f18ab743cd79784ae28cad582f58503
Jul 26 11:46:17 <mclasen>	but I'm a fan of filing bugs only _after_ the debugging, as a holder for the patch that resulted from the debugging
Jul 26 11:47:35 <jjongsma>	or, if ebassi's not around, anyone else? :)
Jul 26 11:49:29 <mclasen>	without seeing more than "regression" hard to say
Jul 26 11:50:22 *	KaL_out is now known as KaL
Jul 26 11:50:34 <jmd>	The documentation for g_simple_action_set_enable says that it should never be called by users.  So why bother putting it in the public API?
Jul 26 11:51:04 <jjongsma>	mclasen, indeed, that's why I want to talk to somebody about it.
Jul 26 11:51:17 <jjongsma>	the regression is that it fails to redraw until we resize the window
Jul 26 11:51:39 <mclasen>	jmd: so other libraries can call it
Jul 26 11:51:47 <jjongsma>	and I'm digging into gtk to figure out what the difference is here and what might have caused the change.
Jul 26 11:51:49 *	mclasen reboots
Jul 26 11:51:57 <rishi>	jmd: In this case, the 'users' of an action are not the users of the GLib API.
Jul 26 11:52:17 <rishi>	The users are those who are proxying or activating the action.
Jul 26 11:52:51 <rishi>	The implementor is the one who actually handles 'activate' and does what the action is supposed to do.
Jul 26 11:54:02 <ebassi>	jjongsma: I'm going to have a couple of meeting in about 10 minutes, so I'll be available only later
Jul 26 11:54:21 <jjongsma>	ebassi, can you ping me when you're avaialble?
Jul 26 11:54:24 <ebassi>	jjongsma: But I remember talking about this with somebody else in the spice team
Jul 26 11:54:32 <jjongsma>	yeah, fidencio 
Jul 26 11:54:37 <ebassi>	jjongsma: Right
Jul 26 11:55:00 <jmd>	rishi: Well I think it is confusing.  I just spent two days trying to figure out how to enable/disable an action - I saw that when I first started looking - but discounted it because of that sentence.
Jul 26 11:55:20 <ebassi>	jjongsma: That commit was partially reverted by the fix for Firefox; if you're tripping up on current master then it means spice-gtk is doing something weird and not guaranteed to work
Jul 26 11:55:52 <rishi>	jmd: Agreed.
Jul 26 11:55:56 <ebassi>	jjongsma: But since I don't know spice-gtk, nor I have time to deal with it, last time I spoke with fidencio I asked for at least understanding what spice-gtk even does
Jul 26 11:56:19 <jjongsma>	ebassi, sure, I'm just trying to figure out what this "something weird" might be and how to fix it.
Jul 26 11:56:47 <jjongsma>	so I'm digging into gtk+ to figure out where we might be violating expectations but haven't come up with anything so far. So I was hoping to just discuss it a bit.
Jul 26 11:57:52 <ebassi>	jjongsma: The commit that you want to look at is: fc569f1ac6ff108afc17f7f439480273826af3a6
Jul 26 11:58:10 <ebassi>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=fc569f1ac6ff108afc17f7f439480273826af3a6
Jul 26 11:59:53 <ebassi>	jjongsma: That commit moves what GtkWidget used to do with double-buffering into GdkWindow — i.e. create a new buffer if the window is a top-level and a native window
Jul 26 12:00:16 <ebassi>	jjongsma: If you've disabled double buffering, everything should be back to normal
Jul 26 12:00:23 <ebassi>	jjongsma: Is spice-gtk double-buffering?
Jul 26 12:00:42 <ebassi>	jjongsma: If it isn't, is it relying on being able to create random cairo_t's on random GdkWindows?
Jul 26 12:00:55 <ebassi>	jjongsma: How does spice-gtk even draw?
Jul 26 12:01:06 <ebassi>	Those are the questions I asked fidencio 
Jul 26 12:01:53 <jjongsma>	double-buffering: yes, creating random cairo_t's: no
Jul 26 12:01:57 <jjongsma>	ebassi, ^
Jul 26 12:02:29 <jjongsma>	ebassi, we draw by connecting to the draw signal and drawing in the provided cairo_t
Jul 26 12:02:55 <jjongsma>	ebassi, the main difference (in gtk+) that I see in the commit that caused the regression is that an expose event previously resulted in a call to gtk_widget_begin_draw_internal(), but after the change, it only calls this function for toplevel GdkWindows.  But I don't know enough to know whether that's relevant to anything.
Jul 26 12:03:31 <ebassi>	jjongsma: Nothing should be relying on expose events in GTK+ 3.x
Jul 26 12:04:00 <ebassi>	jjongsma: In any case, since everything else seems to be working except spice-gtk, I doubt spice-gtk is "just" drawing on the provided cairo_t
Jul 26 12:05:04 <jjongsma>	ebassi, what does "relying on expose events" mean? We don't handle them at all in our application, but they still result in gtk_widget_render() to be called
Jul 26 12:05:51 <ebassi>	Then I fail to understand how spice-gtk is breaking
Jul 26 12:06:23 <jjongsma>	ebassi, for what it's worth, here's our draw function: https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-gtk/tree/src/spice-widget-cairo.c#n65
Jul 26 12:06:23 <ebassi>	The commit I linked added a constraint on what can be double-buffered — top-level, native GdkWindow
Jul 26 12:07:07 <jjongsma>	hmm
Jul 26 12:08:03 <ebassi>	This seems to contradict your "we're double-buffering" statement: https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-gtk/tree/src/spice-widget-cairo.c#n87
Jul 26 12:09:46 <jjongsma>	ebassi, it does seem to contradict it, but the comment is old, I think: https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-gtk/tree/src/spice-widget.c#n605
Jul 26 12:11:05 <baedert>	What's with line 1208 in that file?
Jul 26 12:14:54 <jjongsma>	well, there's a bit of an experimental egl widget as an alternative to the cairo implementation, but that's not being used
Jul 26 12:15:21 <jjongsma>	so enabled is false, which results in double-buffering being enabled.
Jul 26 12:25:48 <mclasen>	jjongsma: sorry, fell off for  a bit
Jul 26 12:25:50 <mclasen>	back now
Jul 26 12:31:44 <jjongsma>	mclasen, well, ebassi showed up briefly
Jul 26 12:34:54 <ebassi>	jjongsma: So, I guess the question is not "stuff fails to draw" but "stuff fails to invalidate the contents of the widget"
Jul 26 12:35:35 <jjongsma>	ebassi, perhaps
Jul 26 12:38:19 <jjongsma>	ebassi, but why would reverting the expose event changes affect that?
Jul 26 12:39:39 <ebassi>	jjongsma: I have no idea
Jul 26 12:41:03 <jjongsma>	ebassi, I must admit that I have a very limited understanding about GdkWindows, and how they relate to GtkWidgets, etc. What makes a GdkWindow a toplevel window?
Jul 26 12:41:20 <ebassi>	jjongsma: The code in gtk_widget_render() is the logical equivalent of what gtkmain.c was doing. What really changed is the code in GdkWindow
Jul 26 12:42:31 <jjongsma>	ebassi, well, it's very very close to the same. But as I said before, there's one difference I can see: the old implementation called gdk_window_begin_paint_region(), which calls gdk_window_begin_paint_internal()
Jul 26 12:42:56 <jjongsma>	ebassi, the new implementation calls gdk-window_begin_draw_frame(), which only calls gdk_window_begin_paint_internal() IF the GdkWindow is a toplevel
Jul 26 12:43:15 <ebassi>	Yes, that's what I said
Jul 26 12:43:37 <jjongsma>	which is why I asked the question above about toplevel GdkWindows
Jul 26 12:45:20 <ebassi>	jjongsma: Right, but, as I said, nothing expects an expose event on a child GdkWindow, these days; that's why I asked if Spice-gtk is using expose events
Jul 26 12:47:15 <ebassi>	Only top-level windows should receive expose events, and trip the redraw; child widgets should draw on the parent's buffer.
Jul 26 12:50:43 <jjongsma>	ebassi, thanks for your patience, I'm slowly getting a better understanding here...
Jul 26 12:53:52 <ebassi>	jjongsma: No problem
Jul 26 12:54:56 <ebassi>	We can tweak the conditions, after all I did that for Firefox; but I want to understand what are the requirements — and if spice-gtk can be changed, in case
Jul 26 12:55:48 <ebassi>	Also because when we break API for 4.0, we're going to pick stricter semantics
Jul 26 12:56:05 <jjongsma>	ebassi, yep. I'll continue to investigate here. I may ask additional questions from time to time
Jul 26 12:56:40 <jjongsma>	at the moment I think I need to try a few things out before I have anything intelligent to say.
Jul 26 12:57:11 <ebassi>	jjongsma: No worries
Jul 26 13:00:59 <jjongsma>	ebassi, another odd thing (in case it triggers any ideas in your mind) is that sometimes after resizing the window, it updates for a few seconds before freezing again...
Jul 26 13:01:47 <jjongsma>	I suspect that's something related to spice-gtk code, but just in case, I thought I'd mention it.
Jul 26 13:05:32 <ebassi>	Doesn't ring a bell
Jul 26 13:06:04 <ebassi>	But, maybe, something is checking the size of the cairo surface used to render the content, and if the size is the same then the widget does not get invalidated
Jul 26 13:06:22 <ebassi>	While you're getting resizing notifications, the surface gets redrawn

Jul 26 13:47:06 <mwleeds>	ebassi: Is there any reason there's not a function json_node_get_path (JsonNode* n) that returns a (unique) JsonPath to the node?
Jul 26 13:54:45 *	dpm-afk is now known as dpm
Jul 26 13:59:18 <ebassi>	mwleeds: If you have the node, why do you need the path?
Jul 26 13:59:30 <ebassi>	JsonPath is pretty much XmlPath - a query API
Jul 26 14:02:15 <mwleeds>	because I want to see if there's a node in another json tree at the same path
Jul 26 14:02:27 <mwleeds>	and if so, replace it
Jul 26 14:10:59 <ebassi>	It would be possible to write a json_path_create_for_node(), but the main reason why it does not exist is we can only guarantee parent-child relationship in a JsonNode tree if it comes from a JsonParser
Jul 26 14:11:18 <ebassi>	i.e. it's not always possible to take a node and retrieve its parent
Jul 26 14:13:13 <iulianradu>	Figured it out
Jul 26 14:13:51 <mwleeds>	we could return NULL in that case
Jul 26 14:14:09 <mwleeds>	but anyway I think I found another way in my situation

Jul 26 15:44:03 <gasuleg>	Hi, I created a GAction and I want know when his state change. Any idea?
Jul 26 15:45:32 <jmd>	gasuleg: Well you created it so you should know!!!
Jul 26 15:46:37 <jmd>	GAction is an interface.
Jul 26 15:47:26 <gasuleg>	jmd, well, I change his state in a class but I want to know when he changes in another
Jul 26 15:48:30 <jmd>	emit a signal, and connect to that signal.
Jul 26 15:50:37 <gasuleg>	jmd, I created this GAction to avoid using an emit signal because I don't know the instance where I change the state of GAction
Jul 26 15:51:20 <jmd>	So how _do_ you change its state?
Jul 26 15:51:50 <jmd>	In the bit of code where its state changes, just emit the signal there.  What is the problem?
Jul 26 15:52:09 <gasuleg>	don't need the instance to change state: g_action_change_state 
Jul 26 15:52:29 <gasuleg>	g_action_change_state (GAction *action,
Jul 26 15:52:29 <gasuleg>	                       GVariant *value);
Jul 26 15:53:58 <jmd>	gasuleg: Right.  .... and what have you got in the implementation of GActionInterface->change_state ??
Jul 26 15:56:08 <gasuleg>	jmd, http://pastebin.com/sV2STDbN
Jul 26 15:56:31 <gasuleg>	display_smartinfo is the name of my GAction
Jul 26 15:56:50 <jmd>	Please answer my question.
Jul 26 15:57:11 <jmd>	What does your GActionInterface->change_state function have ?
Jul 26 15:57:51 <gasuleg>	just boolean
Jul 26 15:58:01 <gasuleg>	(not sure to understand)
Jul 26 15:58:02 <jmd>	Huh?
Jul 26 15:58:08 <jmd>	It should be a function
Jul 26 15:59:04 <jmd>	You said that you created a GAction.  So how did you create it?
Jul 26 15:59:35 <jmd>	If you created it, then you must know when and under what circumstances it changes state.
Jul 26 16:00:14 <jmd>	So, when it changes state, emit a signal.  Then everything which is interested in that state change can connect to the signal.
Jul 26 16:03:33 <gasuleg>	as, I say I change his state in a method of a class where I don't know the instance. I created it like that : http://pastebin.com/EhTkJjim

Jul 26 16:10:45 <jmd>	Right.  See the 5th member of GActionEntry?  It is the change_state function pointer.
Jul 26 16:10:54 <jmd>	Use that pointer to emit a signal.

Jul 26 16:13:23 <jmd>	Actually I don't know what your {0
Jul 26 16:13:41 <jmd>	{0} things are for.  Your code probably crashes?
Jul 26 16:14:30 <gasuleg>	jmd, I work on a free software code, so I just add display_smartinfo line
Jul 26 16:14:50 <gasuleg>	this code work
Jul 26 16:15:03 <gasuleg>	but I don't understand everything
Jul 26 16:15:05 <jmd>	I suggest you got lucky then.
Jul 26 16:15:38 <jmd>	GActionEntry contains 5 pointers.  But you seem to be forcing 6 into it.
Jul 26 16:16:59 <jmd>	Anyway, to answer your original question.  Implement the change_state member.
Jul 26 16:17:29 <jmd>	Note that the documentation says "All stateful actions should provide a handler here".
Jul 26 16:17:42 <jmd>	You have provided no handler.
Jul 26 16:17:56 <gasuleg>	jmd, if I understand its a callback, so i can write the methode i want
Jul 26 16:18:04 <jmd>	sure.
Jul 26 16:18:25 <gasuleg>	ok ok, I see
Jul 26 16:18:27 <gasuleg>	cool
Jul 26 16:18:42 <gasuleg>	thank you jmd for all your help
Jul 26 16:18:47 <gasuleg>	I will try that

Jul 26 16:24:00 <jmd>	gasuleg: Right.  An interesting project. (but I've never yet met anyone who has succeeded building it).
Jul 26 16:25:05 <gasuleg>	jmd, why did you said that?
Jul 26 16:25:42 <jmd>	Most people (including myself) give up in frustration after a few days (weeks) trying.
Jul 26 16:26:40 <gasuleg>	I have an issue again. Can you have a seen on it? http://pastebin.com/axTi6V3y
Jul 26 16:26:56 <gasuleg>	error: �test� was not declared in this scope
Jul 26 16:27:38 <gasuleg>	well, I build it, what is your issue jmd ?
Jul 26 16:28:46 <jmd>	Well you have a symbol 'test'.  The compiler is complaining that there is no such symbol.
Jul 26 16:28:59 <jmd>	line 11
Jul 26 16:29:28 <gasuleg>	yeah, but i creat the method l16
Jul 26 16:29:37 <jmd>	(you still have those {0} there, so I wouldn't expect this code to do anything sensible).
Jul 26 16:29:52 <jmd>	Probably gives lots of compiler warnings?
Jul 26 16:30:12 <gasuleg>	no one or they are hide
Jul 26 16:31:26 <gasuleg>	I will tell the question to the creator about these {0}
Jul 26 16:35:15 <gasuleg>	jmd, we are agree I need to call my method test like that if I have GActionEntry with with elements
Jul 26 16:35:23 <gasuleg>	5 elements*
Jul 26 16:39:33 <gasuleg>	jmd,  ring_actions is an array of GActionEntrys... iirc the compiler gives some warning if you don't put the null at the end of each individual entry
Jul 26 16:40:14 <jmd>	I would expect it to give a warning if you DO put those there.
Jul 26 16:40:34 <jmd>	Even if it doesn't it'll almost certainly crash if you try running it.
Jul 26 16:41:25 <jmd>	That array has 36 pointers in it.
Jul 26 16:41:49 <jmd>	However a GArrayEntry is 5 pointers each.
Jul 26 16:42:17 <jmd>	So what you have there is an array of 5.2 GArrayEntrys.
Jul 26 16:42:28 <jmd>	The .2 is going to cause problems ...

Jul 27 05:54:33 <hramrach>	Hello
Jul 27 05:54:44 <hramrach>	how do I change colors of the default gtk3 theme?
Jul 27 05:55:33 <hramrach>	I tried to copy the gtk-default.css to gtk.css in a theme directory but I lose most 3d appearance of widgets
Jul 27 05:55:57 <hramrach>	My own old theme and themes installed from gnome-look also have this problem
Jul 27 06:06:02 <ebassi>	hramrach: You don't. The only way to change colors is to create a new theme.
Jul 27 06:06:47 <ebassi>	This is not something new: only the Clearlooks engine allowed you to select colors, in gtk2
Jul 27 06:08:34 <hramrach>	so how do you create new theme?
Jul 27 06:09:03 <benzea>	ebassi: that was a GTK+ feature! it worked for all engines except pixmap :)
Jul 27 06:09:05 <hramrach>	presumably copying the get-default.css to gtk.css in a tehme directory creates a new theme but it's missing 3d elements
Jul 27 06:09:22 <hramrach>	*gtk-default
Jul 27 06:09:52 <baedert>	what's get-default.css and what are 3d elements?
Jul 27 06:10:14 <hramrach>	gtk-default
Jul 27 06:10:26 <benzea>	3d elements would be making the base color darker/lighter for gradients, I presume

Jul 27 06:14:07 <hramrach>	there is some difference between the two
Jul 27 06:14:55 <ebassi>	hramrach: So, you're copying Adwaita?
Jul 27 06:15:05 <hramrach>	Raleigh
Jul 27 06:15:31 <hramrach>	but anything goes
Jul 27 06:15:48 <hramrach>	if copying Adwaita is supposed to work I will copy that instead, whatever
Jul 27 06:15:50 <ebassi>	I'm not really sure Raleigh is even up to date
Jul 27 06:16:02 <ebassi>	Anyway, from where are you copying the CSS?
Jul 27 06:16:07 <ebassi>	From the Git repository?
Jul 27 06:16:18 <hramrach>	from Debian package
Jul 27 06:16:24 <heftig>	I think you could use this to get a complete copy of the integrated themes:
Jul 27 06:16:26 <heftig>	gresource list /usr/lib/libgtk-3.so | while read f; do f2=${f#/org/gtk/libgtk/}; [[ $f2 == theme/* ]] || continue; mkdir -p $(dirname $f2); gresource extract /usr/lib/libgtk-3.so $f > $f2; done
Jul 27 06:17:03 <ebassi>	hramrach: CSS files shipped by GTK are part of the shared library; if you look at the files on disk, you'll notice that they are empty
Jul 27 06:17:11 <ebassi>	Unless you're using an ancient version of GTK
Jul 27 06:17:27 <hramrach>	the sauce package
Jul 27 06:17:51 <hramrach>	gresource does not know what to do with libgtk
Jul 27 06:18:30 <hramrach>	it's in arch directory
Jul 27 06:18:42 <hramrach>	will try looking at that
Jul 27 06:20:55 <hramrach>	hm, same
Jul 27 06:20:58 <hramrach>	no change
Jul 27 06:21:18 <heftig>	ebassi: btw, what is the purpose of the gtk-contained*.css files that just get imported?
Jul 27 06:22:00 <hramrach>	there is only gtk.css in Raleigh and using that in place of the gtk-default.css gives the no-3d issue
Jul 27 06:22:35 <ebassi>	heftig: You'll have to ask Lapo
Jul 27 06:22:55 <ebassi>	heftig: I think it's just broken down so that scss can build from different mixins
Jul 27 06:23:09 <heftig>	hramrach: Raleigh is broken
Jul 27 06:24:05 <heftig>	hramrach: it was neglected after Adwaita became the default theme
Jul 27 06:25:24 <baedert>	I somehow remember multiple times where mclasen proposed to drop it
Jul 27 06:33:48 <ebassi>	I honestly thought we already did
Jul 27 08:56:57 <rudrab>	Hi, in a gtk3 application, I am trying to replace titlebar with headerbar
Jul 27 08:57:21 <baedert>	gtk_window_set_titlebar
Jul 27 08:57:27 <rudrab>	the only problem I am facing is I cant drag the window using titlebar
Jul 27 08:57:56 <rudrab>	is there any property I can set for that?
Jul 27 08:58:05 <baedert>	Are you using gtk_window_set_titlebar?
Jul 27 08:58:11 <rudrab>	yes
Jul 27 08:58:50 <baedert>	There is no such property; it just works if the titlebar child widget doesn't consume drags
Jul 27 08:59:36 <rudrab>	actually opposite: I have done Gtk.Window.set_decorated to False. So I dont actually have a titlebar, only headerbar
Jul 27 09:00:10 <baedert>	that's wrong
Jul 27 09:00:16 <ebassi>	rudrab: Use gtk_window_set_titlebar() with a GtkHeaderBar
Jul 27 09:00:24 <ebassi>	Otherwise stuff won't work
Jul 27 09:02:40 <rudrab>	ebassi: will not it display both titlebar and headerbar?
Jul 27 09:02:56 <rudrab>	I guess i have not understood you 
Jul 27 09:02:57 <baedert>	No
Jul 27 09:08:35 <rudrab>	ah...great...thank you both
Jul 27 09:19:30 <heftig>	hm, why is g_unix_signal_source_new limited to a subset of signals?
Jul 27 09:21:41 <hadess>	heftig, probably because it can't safely handle the others
Jul 27 09:22:20 <heftig>	I wonder why. I just need WINCH
Jul 27 09:22:25 <hadess>	catching SIGABRT or SIGSEGV is possible but probably not something you want in your app :)
Jul 27 09:23:04 <hadess>	heftig, probably something that could be added then
Jul 27 09:24:00 <heftig>	(more specifically, i'm trying to use prompt_toolkit + gbulb from python; the former tries to add a handler for SIGWINCH and the latter translates it to g_unix_signal_source_new)
Jul 27 09:32:46 <hramrach>	heftig: I extracted the whole Adwaita theme and moved it to my theme directory. No change. Switched to default theme and back. The theme is still broken in the same way.
Jul 27 09:35:02 <rudrab>	one more thing, in line of my previous question: can I place my menubar (created using Gtk.Builder) inside headerbar as well?
Jul 27 09:36:15 <ebassi>	rudrab: No
Jul 27 09:36:37 <ebassi>	For menus in header bars, you want a GtkMenuButton or similar

Jul 27 10:20:45 <mclasen>	see ebassi's question ^
Jul 27 10:22:07 <Company>	the scale factor is a property of the monitor you're rendering on
Jul 27 10:22:31 <Company>	or the window you're rendering into
Jul 27 10:22:39 <ebassi>	Right
Jul 27 10:23:10 <ebassi>	The issue is that render nodes may have rasterization operations in them, so the need to create a surface (that will then be pushed to GL)
Jul 27 10:23:46 <Company>	but they can query the scale factor for that, no?
Jul 27 10:23:47 <gasuleg>	I try to handle the signal change state (https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GSimpleAction.html#GSimpleAction-change-state) in my GActionEntry (https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GActionMap.html#GActionEntry ) to conect it to a method of an other class. any idea?
Jul 27 10:24:17 <ebassi>	Company: Well, they set the size of the node, which is used to create the surface/drawing context
Jul 27 10:24:31 <gasuleg>	I think it's easy to do but i'm really lost right now
Jul 27 10:24:32 <ebassi>	Company: So the question is
Jul 27 10:24:47 <Company>	i would imagine the scale factor setup happening on the viewport (is that the GL term) level
Jul 27 10:25:15 <ebassi>	Company: Do we add that scaling factor to the node, so that widgets can use the allocation when creating the node; or do we tell widgets to scale the allocation themselves when creating the node
Jul 27 10:25:30 <ebassi>	Company: Not really; you still need to render at a higher scaling factor
Jul 27 10:25:43 <ebassi>	Otherwise the Cairo surface will look like crap
Jul 27 10:25:55 <Company>	yes
Jul 27 10:26:06 <Company>	but the coordinates you use are always in user space
Jul 27 10:26:25 <Company>	ie they will be scaled automatically for you
Jul 27 10:26:38 <ebassi>	If they get scaled up, they will look like arse
Jul 27 10:27:03 <ebassi>	It's not like GL will automatically do things for you
Jul 27 10:27:06 <Company>	well, if you have to upload pixel data, you'll have to look at the scale factor

Jul 27 10:46:31 *	Now talking on #gtk+
Jul 27 10:46:31 *	Topic for #gtk+ is: #gtk+ is proud to announce its selection as the official IRC channel of the Toronto GTK+ Hackfest
Jul 27 10:46:31 *	Topic for #gtk+ set by Company (Mon Jun 13 12:40:28 2016)
Jul 27 10:46:46 <ebassi>	So it would tie it to the drawing operation
Jul 27 10:47:14 <Company>	in GTK, you just cairo_scale() it however you want
Jul 27 10:47:49 <Company>	but that will not cause us to update our textures (or relaod icon pixbufs)
Jul 27 10:48:27 <Company>	no idea if gsk allows any random transform to be applied before rendering
Jul 27 10:51:45 <ebassi>	No; you rasterise into a surface the untransformed contents, and then we apply the transformation when we composite the scene
Jul 27 10:52:04 <ebassi>	Basically, the way a get_render_node() implementation looks like is this: https://paste.gnome.org/pa702plia
Jul 27 10:52:21 <ebassi>	With the option, like alex wants, to save the rasterization across frames if nothing has changed
Jul 27 10:52:38 <ebassi>	If we put a texture cache in the middle
Jul 27 10:53:44 <ebassi>	(That code snippet is basically GtkBox, or any other container with a background)
Jul 27 10:57:34 <Company>	ebassi: so a render node doesn't know what it's rendered to?
Jul 27 10:58:21 <Company>	there doesn't seem to be any association between the node and the GdkDisplay or GdkWindow
Jul 27 10:58:39 <ebassi>	Company: The renderer takes a display, drawing context, and a root node
Jul 27 10:58:57 <ebassi>	Company: That happens at the end of the scene graph build
Jul 27 10:59:11 <Company>	but not the node?
Jul 27 10:59:52 <ebassi>	Not at the node level, no. In theory, you could pass the same tree to two different renderers tied to two different environments
Jul 27 11:00:11 <Company>	that seems bad
Jul 27 11:00:13 <ebassi>	We could turn it inside-out, and have the renderer create nodes
Jul 27 11:00:22 <ebassi>	(I already have a branch that does that)
Jul 27 11:00:29 <Company>	because it makes lots of things more complicated
Jul 27 11:00:39 <Company>	for a flexibility that you almost never use
Jul 27 11:01:06 <ebassi>	Yeah, that's pretty much the same conclusion I came to
Jul 27 11:01:24 <Company>	it's nice if you can render the node to a different renderer
Jul 27 11:01:42 <Company>	but I think a node should always "belong" to one renderer
Jul 27 11:02:01 <Company>	which would be where it gets scale factors etc from
Jul 27 11:02:04 <ebassi>	Yep
Jul 27 11:02:49 <ebassi>	Right, I'll just turn the render node creation inside out, and always ask the renderer to create a node - and it can set up things like scale factors
Jul 27 11:03:00 <Company>	right
Jul 27 11:03:19 <Company>	so there may be a gdk_render_node_get_scale_factor()
Jul 27 11:03:21 <ebassi>	And it makes it easier to create a free-list of render nodes, if the memory profile starts bothering us
Jul 27 11:03:40 <Company>	but all it should do is return gsk_renderer_get_scale_factor (node->priv->renderer);
Jul 27 11:03:46 <ebassi>	Yep
Jul 27 11:04:25 <baedert>	GskRenderNodeFactory!
Jul 27 11:04:32 <ebassi>	baedert: Haha
Jul 27 11:04:39 <ebassi>	Nah, just: gsk_renderer_create_render_node()
Jul 27 11:07:49 <lazka>	is there a way to adjust the pango layout/context of a widget?
Jul 27 11:08:41 <lazka>	I'd like to disable auto bidir in GtkLabel
Jul 27 11:10:17 <heftig>	Cairo is one of GSK's backends?
Jul 27 11:10:30 <mclasen>	garnacho_: hmm; I merged my code to set up all-scroll cursors for when you use the nipple to scroll; but I am occasionally seeing that cursor getting stuck - I guess I'm missing some ways in which the scrolling can end. could you double-check that code in gtkscrolledwindow.c for what I'm missing ?
Jul 27 11:13:24 <garnacho_>	mclasen: wayland?
Jul 27 11:13:40 <mclasen>	now that you mention it, yes
Jul 27 11:14:20 <ebassi>	heftig: Yes; mostly for debugging.
Jul 27 11:14:29 <garnacho_>	aha... that's fishy :)
Jul 27 11:15:01 <ebassi>	heftig: And for macOS, since that GDK backend still does not have OpenGL support
Jul 27 11:16:31 <heftig>	So the actual backends would be OpenGL and pixman?
Jul 27 11:17:34 <heftig>	Or always GL and then software rendering if needed?
Jul 27 11:19:11 <ebassi>	heftig: Always GL, for compositing, and Cairo/pixman for rasterizations
Jul 27 11:19:47 <ebassi>	i.e. widgets draw components on Cairo image surfaces and then we blend them together in a GL scene
Jul 27 11:19:59 <ebassi>	Until we can move more bits to the GPU
Jul 27 11:20:30 <heftig>	So e.g. text rendering is unaffected by the current GSK move?
Jul 27 11:20:41 <ebassi>	Also, for backward compatibility, we still need to allow people to render on Cairo contexts
Jul 27 11:20:59 <ebassi>	heftig: Text rendering is still pretty much a rasterization, so yes: it's not moved to the GPU yet
Jul 27 11:21:55 <ebassi>	We may have a glyph texture cache by copying it from Cogl, but that would still need to rasterize individual glyphs
Jul 27 11:23:37 <rudrab>	Hi, I have just moved to MenuButton from menubar.ui+builder (ebassi, thanks. It looks more gnomic and lot better)
Jul 27 11:24:58 <rudrab>	But I am not getting a way to add keyboard shortcuts. in menubar.ui, I had, say, http://paste.fedoraproject.org/396441/46963308/ to open file.
Jul 27 11:25:23 <rudrab>	how I can add the accel group in menubutton?
Jul 27 11:32:40 <visarion>	Is there a known issue with the Spinner not showing ?  I tried everything, even replacing it with another widget to see if that appears.
Jul 27 11:33:32 <ebassi>	rudrab: https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GAction - https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GMenu

Jul 27 11:47:46 <hramrach>	ebassi: how about widgets that span multiple screens? How do you render those?
Jul 27 11:48:26 <hramrach>	to which screen do you tie it? Or do you redo the binding several times each time you draw a frame?
Jul 27 11:49:59 <baedert>	Depends what the WM does afaik

Jul 27 12:24:16 <jjongsma>	ebassi, btw, we found the issue in spice-gtk, though I don't quite understand the mechanism for failure yet.
Jul 27 12:25:12 <jjongsma>	ebassi, https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-gtk/tree/src/spice-widget-egl.c#n315 <- this function was being called in the 'realize' handler for the widget. 
Jul 27 12:25:41 <jjongsma>	not calling that function resulted in a working widget ...
Jul 27 12:27:12 <hotcfoch>	How can g_async_initable_new_finish can know if there was an error?
Jul 27 12:30:41 <mclasen>	you pass it the async result which contains that information
Jul 27 12:33:55 <ebassi>	jjongsma: Ouch
Jul 27 12:34:30 <ebassi>	You're creating an EGL surface and getting a native window
Jul 27 12:35:31 <ebassi>	This is somewhat similar to what Clutter-GTK does, but Clutter-GTK disables double buffering
Jul 27 12:35:50 <ebassi>	Because that's the only way you're going to be able to draw
Jul 27 12:36:37 <jjongsma>	ebassi, yeah, when egl is enabled, we do disable double-buffering, but this initialization happens even without egl being enabled.
Jul 27 12:36:46 <jjongsma>	I'm not very familiar with this code though, elmarco probably knows better
Jul 27 12:37:13 <ebassi>	Ah, yes.. The rest of the coe in there assumes you can draw on the window surface as if you're the only owner
Jul 27 12:37:58 <ebassi>	jjongsma: It's the GDK_WINDOW_XID call that mucks up everythinge else
Jul 27 12:38:25 <jjongsma>	ebassi, yep, that's what I determined. I commented out everything but that and it still failed. But after commenting that out, it worked ;)
Jul 27 12:39:23 <ebassi>	You are forcing the GdkWindow to have a native surface, which has certain semantics; if you do that then you get to handle a lot of nasty stuff by yourself — including double buffering
Jul 27 12:39:39 <ebassi>	A bunch of stuff will also break, like popovers :-)
Jul 27 12:39:59 <hotcfoch>	mclasen: so the GError is supposed to be in GAsyncResult ?
Jul 27 12:40:01 <jjongsma>	elmarco, ^
Jul 27 12:40:35 <ebassi>	jjongsma: My suggestion would be to use GtkGLArea, if you want to render with GL, not create random EGL context ;-)
Jul 27 12:41:17 <ebassi>	Mostly because GdkGLContext and GtkGLArea will render on the appropriate surface, using the GDK rendering infrastructure, and nothing will break
Jul 27 12:42:26 <elmarco>	ebassi: we use gtkglarea, but we need an egl context, glx won't do
Jul 27 12:42:42 <elmarco>	ebassi: so gtkglarea is only used on wayland so far
Jul 27 12:43:31 <elmarco>	so that egl/x11 stuff is a hack, but we don't have much choice, unless gtk+ start using egl on x11, I wish it would
Jul 27 12:44:01 <hotcfoch>	mclasen: even before calling "g_async_initable_new_finish" ?
Jul 27 12:44:03 <elmarco>	other solution would be to implement the dmabuf import stuff with glx, that's probably harder
Jul 27 12:44:39 <ebassi>	If you use EGL on X11 you're ot going to get a bunch of GLX only extensions — like texture from pixmap; there's an EGL extension for that, but…  meh.
Jul 27 12:45:21 <mclasen>	hotcfoch: no, you have to call finish to get it
Jul 27 12:45:22 <ebassi>	We could let you specify you want an EGL context on X11; then you could create the GdkGLContext yourself
Jul 27 12:46:09 <ebassi>	gdk_x11_gl_context_set_use_egl(); it would need a bunch of silly checks in GdkX11GLContext::realize, but it would be doable
Jul 27 12:46:11 <mwleeds>	ebassi: json_path_match() seems to return already-existing value nodes but newly-allocated object/array nodes. So how can I modify an object node I have the path for?
Jul 27 12:46:36 <ebassi>	mwleeds: You… Don't?
Jul 27 12:47:04 <ebassi>	mwleeds: I'm sorry, it seems you're using json-glib in a way that I didn't think of when I wrote it
Jul 27 12:47:47 <hotcfoch>	mclasen: that's my question? how does it discover there is an error? what kind of information does GAsyncResult provides that can help to that function to find the error?
Jul 27 12:47:51 <ebassi>	The JsonPath API is for generatin "views" or results out of an existing JSON parsed tree
Jul 27 12:48:07 <ebassi>	Sorry, new keyboard. Let's try again.
Jul 27 12:48:12 <elmarco>	ebassi: you could mix egl and glx contexts, or the app using spice-gtk would have to call gdk_x11_gl_context_set_use_egl() ? 
Jul 27 12:48:16 <ebassi>	The JsonPath API is for generating "views" of results out of an existing JSON parsed tree
Jul 27 12:48:31 <ebassi>	elmarco: You cannot mix egl and glx contexts
Jul 27 12:48:36 <ebassi>	You cannot do that even now
Jul 27 12:48:54 <elmarco>	that's what I thought, actually I tried and resulted in weird crashes iirc
Jul 27 12:48:57 <ebassi>	All contexts are shared
Jul 27 12:49:20 <ebassi>	It's like trying to create legacy and core profile contexts at the same time
Jul 27 12:50:04 <mwleeds>	would you be open to a patch changing it to return the already existing nodes?
Jul 27 12:51:30 <ebassi>	mwleeds: No, I would not be open to that. The semantics are documented.
Jul 27 12:51:38 <elmarco>	jjongsma: did you identify the gtk+ commit that broke drawing?
Jul 27 12:52:17 <jjongsma>	elmarco, yeah, sent it to you in email already, but it's https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=2c7b21718f18ab743cd79784ae28cad582f58503
Jul 27 12:52:25 <elmarco>	jjongsma: thanks
Jul 27 12:53:23 <ebassi>	That's the proximal commit; the actual commit is: fc569f1ac6ff108afc17f7f439480273826af3a6
Jul 27 12:53:56 <ebassi>	Since that introduced the rule that double buffering can only occur on top-level native GdkWindow
Jul 27 12:54:03 <mwleeds>	documented where? the json_path_match docs don't say anything about this
Jul 27 12:54:35 <ebassi>	Commit 2c7b21718 just made GTK use those semantics
Jul 27 12:55:28 <feaneron>	mclasen: hey, please, pretend you've never seen that couple of patches I sent before
Jul 27 12:55:38 *	feaneron is absolutely ashamed of that
Jul 27 12:56:40 <ebassi>	mwleeds: It says it creates a new JsonNode of array type. You're right that it doesn't say that the element nodes are new, but I honestly don't want to make it return nodes from another tree
Jul 27 12:56:54 <ebassi>	mwleeds: The memory management model of JsonNode is already a massive fuck up
Jul 27 12:57:23 <ebassi>	It also maps to the behaviour of other JsonPath implementations, which return new nodes
Jul 27 12:58:53 <elmarco>	jjongsma: I guess our easier alternative is to not support switch 2d/3d anymore (or just link older gtk+ statically, /me half-kidding)
Jul 27 12:58:57 <mclasen>	hotcfoch: an async result is mainly a container for ... the result of an operation
Jul 27 12:59:13 <mclasen>	one possible result is an error
Jul 27 12:59:31 <mwleeds>	It already does return nodes from another tree when they are value nodes
Jul 27 13:00:35 <mwleeds>	so maybe the patch should be to make it return all new nodes
Jul 27 13:01:24 <ebassi>	mwleeds: I honestly don't understand what your goal is, then. I thought you wanted to get existing nodes
Jul 27 13:02:17 <mwleeds>	yeah that patch wouldn't help me at all. I just suggested it to make the behavior consistent with what you said about not wanting to return nodes from another tree.
Jul 27 13:03:35 <ebassi>	mwleeds: It copies them, which unsets the parent
Jul 27 13:03:46 <ebassi>	mwleeds: So it always returns new nodes
Jul 27 13:06:43 <mwleeds>	I'm not sure about the implementation but when I called json_node_set_value on a node it returned the original one was modified with the new value. Anyway I'll just figure out another way to do it; don't want to waste any more of your time.

Jul 27 13:22:22 <halfline>	gasuleg: you probably want to use the "notify::property-name" signal
Jul 27 13:22:23 <ebassi>	gasuleg: If you want to know if a property value has changed, there's the "notify" signal on GObject

Jul 27 13:30:17 <ebassi>	The signal signature is the one for GObject::notify — you can check in the GObject API reference for it
Jul 27 13:31:28 <gasuleg>	but... with this line g_signal_connect don't know what GObject i want to check
Jul 27 13:31:52 <gasuleg>	tried something like that but not working : g_signal_connect(view, "notify::smartinfo_action", G_CALLBACK(display_smartinfo_view),NULL);

Jul 28 08:45:43 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769076 gobject, normal, gtkdev, NEW , Fix warning: attempt to override closure->va_marshal with new marshal
Jul 28 08:45:53 <mclasen>	what are you referring to with "the code" ?
Jul 28 08:47:58 <mclasen>	oh, now I get it
Jul 28 09:23:39 <Company>	mclasen: My biggest issue with the code is that I'm not sure what the purpose of the marshaller is
Jul 28 09:24:04 <Company>	mclasen: ie if a marshaller may do extra work or if we expect it to be always the same generic piece of code
Jul 28 09:24:48 <mclasen>	its purpose is to marshal arguments
Jul 28 09:25:28 <Company>	yeah, but is something like the cairo_save/restore we do in GtkWidget::draw intended to be allowed?
Jul 28 09:27:25 <mclasen>	I think questions about intent and purpose are very often futile
Jul 28 09:27:35 <mclasen>	who could even answer that, and why does it matter ?
Jul 28 09:27:46 <Company>	because if it is allowed, then the fix you did would have fixed a real critical bug (because it'd bypass that save/restore)
Jul 28 09:28:19 <mclasen>	you mean the patch I attached to the bug ? or what fix ?
Jul 28 09:28:24 <Company>	and if that wasn't intended, then keeping the va marhsllers would be a good idea (because it improves performance in cases where people pass the default marshaller anyway)
Jul 28 09:28:29 <Company>	yeah, that patch
Jul 28 09:29:45 <mclasen>	one thing is clear: the va marshaller must be functionally equivalent to the marshaller
Jul 28 09:29:46 <Company>	also, it might be useful to write a testcase that checks marshallers get called
Jul 28 09:30:10 <mclasen>	if gobject somehow messes that up by using implicitly set va marshallers, then thats a bug
Jul 28 09:30:41 <Company>	one thing is not clear: Does the marshaller have to be functionally equivalent to the marshaller that glib-genmarshal would have generated?
Jul 28 09:57:06 <mclasen>	they commonly are, but I think that is not a strict requirement
Jul 28 09:57:42 <mclasen>	I would expect it to be documented if they aren't (as we do for ::draw)
Jul 28 10:07:34 <oholy>	mclasen, hey

Jul 28 10:08:45 <oholy>	mclasen, I am afraid that we don't want to add several GtkStacks to workaround this... isn't there another way?

Jul 28 10:14:18 <mclasen>	you can launch your search provider manually with G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all from a terminal
Jul 28 10:14:54 <mclasen>	or you can prefix the commandline the service file with systemd-cat to redirect its output to the journal

Jul 28 10:22:13 <ericwill>	mclasen / Company can we get a comment for https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=768902
Jul 28 10:22:13 <bugbot>	Bug 768902: .General, major, gtk-bugs, NEW , Font too small when using gtk_widget_override_font()
Jul 28 10:22:49 <rishi>	jwendell:  Hard to say without looking at the code and/or XML, I guess.
Jul 28 10:23:49 <baedert>	ericwill: I didn't understand why using css only works for default/initial font size
Jul 28 10:24:04 <mclasen>	ericwill: "There is a font size problem" is not really very concrete, as a problem description
Jul 28 10:24:05 <Company>	ericwill: I think we have patches that change things to multiply with dpi somewhere
Jul 28 10:24:18 <mclasen>	and the the testcase is using override_font
Jul 28 10:24:37 <Company>	ericwill: maybe we need to do that too in the override_font case (actually in the assign vfunc of the font css property)
Jul 28 10:25:06 <baedert>	mclasen: What else would it use?
Jul 28 10:25:09 *	Company no idea, hasn't looked at override_font() in ages
Jul 28 10:25:17 <ericwill>	mclasen Company let me clarify: the change in 3.21.x that calculates font sizes returns a significantly smaller size using the new DPI system
Jul 28 10:25:42 <mclasen>	here is what the docs say: 3.16: This function is not useful in the context of CSS-based
Jul 28 10:25:45 <mclasen>	 *   rendering. If you wish to change the font a widget uses to render its text
Jul 28 10:25:46 <mclasen>	 *   you should use a custom CSS style, through an application-specific
Jul 28 10:25:48 <mclasen>	 *   #GtkStyleProvider and a CSS style class.
Jul 28 10:26:17 <baedert>	I know, but given the bug title, of course it uses override_font
Jul 28 10:26:38 <ebassi>	I thought the issue in Eclipse was that setting the font-size in CSS didn't work
Jul 28 10:26:40 <Company>	ericwill: so we need to do the same math (or the reverse version) in the override_font() case it seems to me?
Jul 28 10:27:14 <ericwill>	Company most likely, using CSS uses the correct sizing but it introduces other issues that would require a lot of work for us
Jul 28 10:27:16 <mclasen>	baedert: but the description of the bug talks about 3.21 changes unrelated to override_font
Jul 28 10:27:25 <ericwill>	it would be easier to continue to use override_font
Jul 28 10:27:33 <mclasen>	as I said, not crisp enough of a bug to incite action
Jul 28 10:29:46 <jwendell>	rishi, I see, thanks. I'll ask for help when the code is on github then :)
Jul 28 10:31:42 <ericwill>	Company mclasen maybe the bug title was a bit vague
Jul 28 10:32:26 <mclasen>	looks like Company has an idea for how to keep override_font limping along a bit better
Jul 28 10:32:49 <ericwill>	okay
Jul 28 10:32:58 <ericwill>	our investigations lead us to gtkcssenumvalue
Jul 28 10:33:12 <Company>	ericwill: I think something like https://paste.fedoraproject.org/396880/14697163/ might work
Jul 28 10:33:13 <ericwill>	where the font size returned by font_size * get_dpi() / 72.0 are too small
Jul 28 10:33:39 <ericwill>	Company yeah that looks promising
Jul 28 10:33:52 <Company>	ericwill: didn't compile that and i might have done the order wrong - could you try it?
Jul 28 10:34:29 <ericwill>	will do
Jul 28 10:34:43 <Company>	the issue is probably that we report font sizes in PX inside css while the pango code uses PT
Jul 28 10:35:11 <Company>	so making sure we transform between them everywhere is an ongoing task
Jul 28 10:38:26 <Company>	ebassi, mclasen: Do we need to talk about the versioning results from the hackfest in some GTK guadec talk?
Jul 28 10:38:54 <mclasen>	we should, probably
Jul 28 10:39:08 <mclasen>	given that I'm talk-less this time (yay!), it'll have to be yours
Jul 28 10:39:41 <Company>	yeah, i guess i'll do that
Jul 28 10:40:11 <Company>	wish there was a schedule so I knew how much time was between my talk and the GTK bof
Jul 28 10:40:21 <Company>	so people have enough time to think about things

Jul 28 11:15:00 <pochu>	Company: ^
Jul 28 11:15:06 <ericwill>	Company the patch is great except for the order
Jul 28 11:15:12 <ericwill>	it should 96.0 / 72.0
Jul 28 11:15:17 <ericwill>	fixes our issue
Jul 28 11:15:20 <ericwill>	*should be

Jul 28 11:16:18 <Company>	pochu: thx for looking at the testsuite! Patches look great
Jul 28 11:17:26 <pochu>	Company: thanks :) both pushed
Jul 28 11:18:24 <Company>	ericwill: which one should be switched? assign or query?
Jul 28 11:18:36 <ericwill>	Company I switched both of them
Jul 28 11:20:31 <Company>	that seems like an awful lot of multiplications...
Jul 28 11:21:01 <Company>	actually, the query func is run everywhere all the time?!
Jul 28 11:23:23 <ericwill>	Company this is the working patch: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/396921/69719353/
Jul 28 11:23:26 <ericwill>	just swapped the numbers
Jul 28 11:24:28 <Company>	ericwill: line 18 of that patch should make all text everywhere 1.3x larger than before
Jul 28 11:24:32 <Company>	I think
Jul 28 11:24:41 <mclasen>	isn't it silly to stuff 100 into number_value_get only to scale the value afterwards ?
Jul 28 11:24:59 <Company>	mclasen: number_value_get() is a stupid function
Jul 28 11:25:19 <Company>	mclasen: because it takes the value for 100% as the 2nd argument - even for numbers that don't support percentages
Jul 28 11:25:33 <ericwill>	Company ah so maybe change it only for the assign function?
Jul 28 11:26:08 <ericwill>	let me try that
Jul 28 11:26:11 <Company>	ericwill: that seems wrong too, becauise then assigning multiplies but querying doesn't...
Jul 28 11:26:46 <Company>	ericwill: but it seems we already convert when querying the "font" property - just not when querying font-size
Jul 28 11:28:21 <Company>	ericwill: I think it might be useful to move the conversion
Jul 28 11:32:50 <Company>	ericwill: can you try https://paste.fedoraproject.org/396929/97199451/ ?
Jul 28 11:34:39 <ericwill>	Company sure
Jul 28 11:35:01 <Company>	without the first patch ofc
Jul 28 11:40:56 <ericwill>	Company yeah that patch works
Jul 28 11:40:58 <ericwill>	fixes the bug
Jul 28 11:41:15 <Company>	then let's go with that one
Jul 28 11:41:56 <ericwill>	Company okay, will you commit it?

Jul 28 14:57:12 <tonyctl>	hey I'm having an issue where I call gtk_widget_show_all() on my widget and it doesn't get mapped
Jul 28 14:57:22 <tonyctl>	can anyone give me some tips on how to debug it?
Jul 28 14:57:50 <baedert>	... is the parent of the widget mapped?
Jul 28 14:58:44 <tonyctl>	it's not showing up on the screen
Jul 28 14:59:26 <baedert>	check the mapped status and allocation of the widget and all parent widgets with the inspector
Jul 28 14:59:45 <tonyctl>	I checked mapped status and it says it's mapped
Jul 28 15:00:49 <tonyctl>	I never get a createnotify from the x server
Jul 28 15:04:04 <swilmet>	tonyctl: gtk_widget_set_no_show_all() ?
Jul 28 15:07:14 <tonyctl>	swilmet: that didn't seem to affect it
Jul 28 15:07:55 <tonyctl>	I'm working on a bug in a complicated application framework called cef so I think it might be a threading issue
Jul 28 15:07:59 <swilmet>	tonyctl: I meant, if it's called somewhere, you should either remove it or call gtk_widget_show()
Jul 28 15:09:08 <swilmet>	tonyctl: gtk functions should be called only from the main thread
Jul 28 15:10:19 <tonyctl>	yeah I looked into that and it seems like everything is running on the main thread
Jul 28 15:11:34 <tonyctl>	also maybe like 1/20 times it works properly
Jul 28 15:12:14 <tonyctl>	here is the bug I filed in cef: https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/issues/1946/linux-cefclient-example-hangs-when-opening
Jul 28 15:56:39 <iulianradu>	there's no way to remove a single item from a GtkListBox?
Jul 28 15:56:56 <iulianradu>	Without binding a model to it
Jul 28 15:57:04 <baedert>	there's always gtk_container_remove
Jul 28 15:57:20 <iulianradu>	Oh, right
Jul 28 16:19:56 <tonyctl>	so cef has some calls that interact with the xwindow of the gtk widget
Jul 28 16:20:17 <tonyctl>	if I set xlib to make all its calls to be synchronous, I don't get that bug
Jul 28 16:21:02 <tonyctl>	I wonder if there was some bad interactions between gtk and xlib

Jul 28 16:47:02 <tonyctl>	I think maybe they are missing a flush somewhere
Jul 28 16:47:05 <halfline>	honestly probably a better bet to move your X calls to the main thread
Jul 28 16:47:18 <halfline>	if possible
Jul 28 16:47:54 <tonyctl>	I haven't checked if all the X calls happen on the main thread, but that would probably be my next move
Jul 28 16:48:57 <halfline>	oh guess i misunderstood you
Jul 28 16:53:12 <bugbot>	New gtk+ bug 769287 filed by lists.ban@herbesfolles.org.
Jul 28 16:53:12 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769287 Widget: Other, normal, gtk-bugs, NEW , GtkMenuToolButton:show-menu is emitted twice and breaks dynamic menus
Jul 28 17:50:04 <rudrab>	anyone please?
Jul 28 21:02:32 <hugomg>	Hello there! I'm working on getting rid of deprecation warnings from an existing gtk program and right now the most common complaint  GTK has is the "use-stock" property in GtkButton
Jul 28 21:03:53 <hugomg>	However, I can't figure out how I'm supposed to change my code to get rid of this warning. The current system with "stock items" puts both a nice icon and a translated label in the button. Am I supposed to try to replicate this by hand using images (with appropriate "icon-name") and a separate label?
Jul 28 21:04:45 <hugomg>	Or should I get rid of one of  the two (the label or the icon)? I heard somewhere that GTK is discouraging developers from putting icons in buttons now.
Jul 28 21:28:08 <mclasen>	hugomg: if you want to keep both icon and label  in buttons without using deprecated api, use gtk_button_set_label and gtk_button_set_image
Jul 28 21:28:44 <hugomg>	the part that confuses me the most is whether I even should
Jul 28 21:29:02 <hugomg>	because in the new api they separated the icon and label, which used to be defined together
Jul 28 21:29:58 <mclasen>	buttons with icons and labels have certainly become unfashionable 
Jul 28 21:30:12 <hugomg>	I mean, whoever originally coded those button only made it have both image and label because thats what "use-stock" did.
Jul 28 21:30:25 <mclasen>	right
Jul 28 21:31:41 <mclasen>	in that case, just using gtk_button_new_with_label will give you a button with a label
Jul 28 21:32:01 <mclasen>	and gtk_button_from_from_icon_name will give you a button with an icon
Jul 28 21:32:42 <hugomg>	if I use a label I need to call some function to translate it don't I?
Jul 28 21:32:50 <hugomg>	The "use-stock" used to do that as well
Jul 28 21:32:56 <mclasen>	yes
Jul 28 21:34:16 <mclasen>	if your application is set up for translations with gettext, then just using _("My label") is enough
Jul 28 21:34:56 <hugomg>	the application is in Lua so I'll need to figure out what is its equivalent to the "_" bit
Jul 28 21:35:15 <hugomg>	but in any case, are there "default" labels for things like "Open" , "Close" and so on?
Jul 28 21:35:26 <hugomg>	and where would I find a list, if so?
Jul 28 21:36:44 <GvP>	hello I had a question regarding the theme for rhythmbox, I believe that it's hard to differentiate whether the shuffle and repeat buttons are selected using the visible indicator
Jul 28 21:37:25 <GvP>	and was thinking that there may be a way to display them better such as inverting or highlighting more
Jul 28 21:37:25 <mclasen>	well, thats what the stock system is
Jul 29 05:43:47 <nacho>	ebassi, hey
Jul 29 05:44:05 <nacho>	ebassi, any chance to release json-glib? :)

Jul 29 08:54:28 <visarion>	Weird problem for me. Whatever I do, even if I view the gtk3-demo, I can't see a Spinner using jhbuild 
Jul 29 09:17:51 <The_gull>	visarion: `jhbuild run gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations true` ?
Jul 29 09:20:05 <visarion>	The_gull: I ran that command, but still I can't view the Spinner in gt3-demo

Jul 29 09:21:22 <ebassi>	visarion: Are you running GNOME inside a VM?
Jul 29 09:21:32 <visarion>	ebassi: No
Jul 29 09:22:03 <ebassi>	visarion: Which desktop environment are you using to build gtk3-demo under jhbuild?
Jul 29 09:22:15 <visarion>	fedora 24
Jul 29 09:22:24 <ebassi>	Running GNOME?
Jul 29 09:22:28 <visarion>	yeah
Jul 29 09:22:36 <ebassi>	Mmh
Jul 29 09:22:52 <The_gull>	visarion: a custom theme ?
Jul 29 09:23:07 <visarion>	the spinner stopped showing while still on fedora23, I don't know why
Jul 29 09:23:18 <visarion>	never saw the spinner after that, under jhbuild
Jul 29 09:23:28 <visarion>	no custom theme
Jul 29 09:24:27 <visarion>	it's not a big problem for me, as I can test what I code regarding the Spinner outside of jhbuild
Jul 29 09:24:52 <baedert>	do you have adwaita-icon-theme built?
Jul 29 09:24:53 <ebassi>	visarion: What does `glxinfo | grep "renderer string"` say?
Jul 29 09:25:37 <visarion>	OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) HD Graphics 5500 (Broadwell GT2) 
Jul 29 09:26:12 <ebassi>	Okay, so the system is not disabling animations because it cannot keep up
Jul 29 09:26:30 <ebassi>	I'm out of ideas
Jul 29 09:26:45 <ebassi>	And I cannot reproduce, here on Fedora 24 and Intel

Jul 29 09:28:49 <visarion>	baedert: I don't think I played with any of that
Jul 29 09:29:05 <visarion>	so they are default I guess
Jul 29 09:30:39 <baedert>	the default was gnome-icon-theme once and then switched to adwaita-icon-theme

Jul 29 12:45:10 <mgorse>	mclasen: I'm not sure if you're the person to ask, but do you know if anyone has looked at bgo#768738? I can't tell because the bug isn't public
Jul 29 12:45:56 <mclasen>	I asked Company to look at it, if thats the one I'm thinking of
Jul 29 12:46:34 <Company>	it isn't
Jul 29 12:46:43 <Company>	because i'm not authorized on that one :)
Jul 29 12:46:56 <mgorse>	Okay. Patch looks okay to me, fwiw. It's against gdk-pixbuf
Jul 29 12:47:05 <mclasen>	try now
Jul 29 12:47:36 <mclasen>	we had some existential questions around security of gdk-pixbuf
Jul 29 12:47:51 <mclasen>	and I think thats where we left things the last time we talked about it

Jul 29 13:54:38 <throwaway849>	does anyone know how to have a gtk program run when linux starts?
Jul 29 14:02:40 <lufimtse>	hullo folks. I have an async function that has a callback. I need to turn that into a syncronous call like "result = my_async_function()". Is there a good way of doing it? (I've looked at GTask, seems kinda complicated? anyone has a snippet?)
Jul 29 14:03:01 <baedert>	GTask is how you make something async, not sync
Jul 29 14:03:07 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 29 14:03:13 <lufimtse>	any good method to go the other way?
Jul 29 14:03:30 <baedert>	you *could* create a new mainloop, but... why do you want to do that?
Jul 29 14:03:53 <lufimtse>	I"m a library developer, our call is syncronous, but underlying call is async
Jul 29 14:04:25 <lufimtse>	spin lock?
Jul 29 14:04:28 <baedert>	that's kind of useless, that sync call might block even undefined amount of time...
Jul 29 14:04:39 <baedert>	yes, essentially
Jul 29 14:04:46 <lufimtse>	it runs in it's own thread, so I guess... 
Jul 29 14:04:56 <lufimtse>	in it's own async thread
Jul 29 14:05:08 <lufimtse>	like an async thread calling another async thread...
Jul 29 14:05:34 <lufimtse>	baedert, do you know of any good spin lock mechanism, does glib have something build in or just regular pthreads?
Jul 29 14:08:57 <baedert>	I have only seen that being done in https://git.gnome.org/browse/librest/tree/rest/rest-proxy-call.c?h=librest-0-7#n1403
Jul 29 14:25:29 <lufimtse>	baedert, I guess go with GMutex instead?
Jul 29 14:25:43 <lufimtse>	considering it'll be run in the context of a single thread
Jul 29 14:26:25 <tonyctl>	hey how do I get a gtk window from a gtk widget?
Jul 29 14:27:15 <baedert>	gtk_widget_get_toplevel

Jul 29 14:28:11 <baedert>	first check if it even is a GtkWindow

Jul 30 07:07:27 <rudrab>	basically I am trying to place a combobox inside a cell
Jul 30 07:12:26 <The_gull>	rudrab: inside a GtkTreeView, you mean ?
Jul 30 07:12:42 <rudrab>	The_gull:yes
Jul 30 07:13:47 <The_gull>	rudrab: there’s GtkCellRendererCombo
Jul 30 07:14:42 <rudrab>	The_gull: Thats what I am trying to do. But I am trying to only get the signal on click, but GtkCellRendererCombo is also replacing the string
Jul 30 07:15:08 <iulianradu>	I'd like to have a GSequence or a GList as a property. Do I need to make register that as a boxed type first?
Jul 30 07:15:30 <rudrab>	The_gull: I am following http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cellrenderers.html#cellrenderercombo
Jul 30 07:16:25 <rudrab>	while I just want to get the on_combo_changed activated, I dont want to replace the string
Jul 30 07:18:33 <The_gull>	rudrab: what are you trying to archive ? a combobox is something that let the user select something between multiple choice, is that really your need ?
Jul 30 07:20:40 <rudrab>	The_gull: yes. I just need to select something, rest will be done on the function
Jul 30 07:21:05 <rudrab>	But, as in the example, the choice is replaced in the string
Jul 30 07:21:11 <rudrab>	which I dont want
Jul 30 07:26:42 <The_gull>	rudrab: how do you want the user to know about the currently selected option ?
Jul 30 07:28:06 <rudrab>	The_gull: user will just click on the combobox option, and no option is selected by default
Jul 30 07:31:52 <The_gull>	rudrab: I’d suggest using a GtkCellRendererCombo with, as a first choice, a « -- Select your option -- » entry ; else, you’re on your own, because what you want is not a standard GtkCellRenederer, and such a design not even exists as a standard GtkWidget…

Jul 30 13:16:50 <Kostic>	Hi everyone. Where can I find the css with which I can turn GtkButtons to blue and red (as in gnome-screenshot and in gnome-sound-recorder)?
Jul 30 13:17:35 <Kostic>	Actually, this one is more for #gnome.
Jul 30 13:18:56 <borschty>	for red, add the "destructive-action" style class to a button
Jul 30 13:19:18 <Kostic>	Really? That's... Simple. :)
Jul 30 13:20:01 <borschty>	and blue is "suggested-action"
Jul 30 13:20:24 <borschty>	(of course the colors you will get depend on the theme)

Jul 30 13:35:10 <ernestask>	shouldn’t it be context.add_class()?
Jul 30 13:36:31 <Kostic>	Yes. You are right. :)

Jul 30 22:52:39 <Rhetorical>	I'm having problems with a dark gtk 3.0 theme and nm-applet. The theme has applied to everything except the background of text boxes (e.g., the whole right-click menu for the icon, the dropdown lists, the connection information box, etc.), so I've ended up with light text on the default light background. I've done some googling, but not had any luck. Where
Jul 30 22:52:39 <Rhetorical>	would be a good place to start looking for a solution?
Jul 30 23:36:07 <Company>	Rhetorical: the easiest solution may be restarting nm-applet and hoping it's a bug resulting from switching the theme that goes away with the restart
Jul 31 05:53:52 <The_gull>	Rhetorical: open a bug against the theme..?

Jul 31 22:05:10 <raymod2>	Is it feasible to compile a GTK application to run on both 32-bit and 64-bit Linux?
Jul 31 22:06:56 <raymod2>	When I compile the GTK application in a 64-bit Fedora VM it won't run on a 32-bit Fedora VM (which makes sense).  But also when I compile the GTK application in a 32-bit Fedora VM it won't ron on a 64-bit VM.  It complains about missing shared libraries (ie. libgtk-3.so.0).
Jul 31 22:09:17 <TingPing>	raymod2, just make two packages..
Jul 31 22:11:19 <raymod2>	I guess that is an option.  I don't think my application benefits from 64-bit, though, so I would rather distribute just one package.  That's my strategy on Windows.
Jul 31 22:12:17 <TingPing>	some distros support multilib, but that is generally only for proprietary things that can't be rebuilt
Jul 31 22:12:54 <raymod2>	OSX doesn't have this problem because they are 64-bit only.
Jul 31 23:34:17 <benwaffle>	OSX has multilib
Jul 31 23:34:35 <benwaffle>	multiple architectures in a single file
Aug 01 00:25:00 <raymod2>	benwaffle - yeah that's for older OSX versions - it's been 64-bit only for awhile

Aug 01 00:27:44 <raymod2>	ooops (July 2011)
Aug 01 00:52:43 <grawity>	distributing "only 32-bit" is going to be a pain in the ass for many people, too

Aug 01 05:48:46 <iulianradu>	baedert: Hi! I'd like to retrieve some data from some widgets inside a dialog when the dialog is being destroyed. Where should I do that?
Aug 01 05:51:17 <baedert>	umm delete-event? dunno
Aug 01 05:55:54 <iulianradu>	baedert: Actually, I was hoping to override/connect to a signal of a child widget of that dialog (which is not a toplevel window) and save that from that widget when that widget is destroyed.
Aug 01 05:57:20 <iulianradu>	save data from it's children*
Aug 01 05:57:42 <iulianradu>	I tried overriding destroy () for that widget but sometimes it's children are destroyed before I can call get_text () and such
Aug 01 05:58:21 <baedert>	get_text on the toplevel?
Aug 01 06:02:49 <ebassi>	iulianradu: You cannot really know the state of the widgets during destruction
Aug 01 06:03:10 <iulianradu>	baedert: On a entry inside the widget whose signal I override.
Aug 01 06:03:50 <iulianradu>	ebassi: Is there a moment when I know their state before destruction?
Aug 01 06:03:58 <ebassi>	iulianradu: What kind of data are you trying to get, and for what purpose?
Aug 01 06:04:41 <ebassi>	iulianradu: In general, you don't gather data when you get to the destruction phase; you update your model whenever the widgets state change
Aug 01 06:05:15 <ebassi>	https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/unstable/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-destroy — as per doc :-)
Aug 01 06:05:47 <iulianradu>	ebassi: Title/uri of a bookmark. I was hoping not to save everything to a file each time I change the text inside an entry
Aug 01 06:06:30 <baedert>	you can save on confirm and/or delete-event of the toplevel I guess?
Aug 01 06:07:06 <ebassi>	iulianradu: You can install a timeout and coalesce multiple changes
Aug 01 06:07:52 <ebassi>	iulianradu: But, in general, you should save to a file when the dialog is closed
Aug 01 06:08:09 <ebassi>	(assuming it's a GtkDialog, then it's a simple case of connecting to the "response" signal)
Aug 01 06:08:34 <ebassi>	iulianradu: You can save to file on destroy; what you cannot do is query the widgets during destruction
Aug 01 06:09:47 <ebassi>	iulianradu: Basically, you update a bunch of stored strings every time the GtkEntry changes; then, on the dialog's destruction you save those strings to a file — or, better yet, you queue an idle that saves to a file
Aug 01 06:09:51 <iulianradu>	baedert, ebassi: I'm also using my widget (a Grid) in a popover. I was hoping to save everything when the grid is destroyed, not it's toplevel
Aug 01 06:09:54 <ebassi>	to avoid blocking the widget destruction
Aug 01 06:10:29 <ebassi>	Or queue a GTask
Aug 01 06:10:35 <ebassi>	(even better)
Aug 01 06:12:13 <iulianradu>	ebassi: That would work
Aug 01 06:12:24 <ebassi>	If you want to get fancy, you could create a small object that holds the title and uri of a bookmark as two properties, and use a property binding to keep those two properties in sync with the GtkEntry:text one
Aug 01 06:12:53 <ebassi>	Then, when the grid gets destroyed, you pass the object to a GTask that saves the contents of the object into a file
Aug 01 06:13:53 <iulianradu>	ebassi: Oh! That's great! I already have the object
Aug 01 06:14:32 <iulianradu>	baedert, ebassi: Thanks for help!

Aug 01 06:34:57 <jaeckel>	I'm using GIOChannel from glib 2.44.1 to read data from a serial port, we just found out that if the serial device outputs a string that ends in ",B\r" the GIO channel seems to eat up the 
Aug 01 06:35:44 <baedert>	the suspense is killing me
Aug 01 06:35:53 <jaeckel>	",B" and it was never seen again... and it happens always... I roughly searched for it, but couldn't find any hint, is that familiar to someone else?
Aug 01 06:36:06 <jaeckel>	sorry for the accidental error in between :D
Aug 01 06:36:12 <jaeckel>	s/error/enter
Aug 01 06:37:13 <jaeckel>	and sorry for the bad grammar...
Aug 01 06:46:34 <mceier>	I assume that you're checking serial device output, by printing it on the console: \r is control code that means to return to the begining of line - if you're outputting ",B\r" to console, anything that follows will overwrite ",B". 
Aug 01 07:00:09 <jaeckel>	well, but that doesn't explain why it does that only for ",B" if I have ",[ACD]" it works fine...
Aug 01 07:15:45 <jaeckel>	what is also weird is that if I use g_io_channel_set_line_term(data_channel, "\r", -1); I receive nothing, if I add "\n" there I receive something... I also do g_io_channel_set_encoding(data_channel, NULL, NULL); ...
Aug 01 07:16:39 <jaeckel>	and just to make it clear, yes the serial device sends \r(0x0d) as line terminator
Aug 01 07:54:21 <jaeckel>	okay, the serial port has the ICRNL option set which explains the \r to \n translation
Aug 01 07:59:54 <jaeckel>	and ICANON

Aug 01 08:02:34 <rudrab>	Hi, how I can add a row index to a treeview? I am currently doing that a bit artificially as https://paste.gnome.org/pamp65exv

Aug 01 08:07:23 <jaeckel>	thx for your help btw
Aug 01 08:07:24 <jaeckel>	bye
Aug 01 08:18:06 <garnacho>	rudrab: sounds like an usecase for Gtk.TreeViewColumn's set_cell_data_func()
Aug 01 08:30:54 <LRN>	what's the vala equivalent of #ifdef G_OS_WIN32 ?
Aug 01 08:32:51 <rudrab>	garnacho: thanks, but the problem is to get the row index itself. When I am editing, I can get the row number from get_selected_rows().get_indices(), but when inserting a new line(like opening from a file), how I will get the row number?
Aug 01 08:41:33 <garnacho>	rudrab: the cell data func is run to set up the cell renderer before doing anything involved with any given row. In the callback you are given the current iter that's being set up, if you pull the index from there and set it as the cell renderer text, you get a self-numbering column/renderer
Aug 01 08:41:41 <garnacho>	rudrab: see https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkTreeViewColumn.html#GtkTreeCellDataFunc

Aug 01 11:08:27 <owen>	I add an action to a GtkApplicationWindow, I put a button in that window, I set the action-name of the button to <action_name> or win.<action-name>, it stays disabled - is there anything else i need to do?

Aug 01 11:10:53 <mclasen>	ah
Aug 01 11:11:01 <owen>	convention seems to be actions are _ but I expected them to use - like signals/props so got confused and used a _ in one place and a - in another

Aug 01 11:13:35 <owen>	Perhaps, not sure that it common
Aug 01 11:13:59 <owen>	Probably would have been good to *forbid* underscores in action names, but too late for that

Aug 01 13:08:51 <hotcfoch>	hi
Aug 01 13:09:02 <hotcfoch>	is it possible to get the list of callback functions for a g_obect?
Aug 01 13:14:51 <swilmet>	hotcfoch: for a certain signal, call g_signal_lookup() and g_signal_handler_find()
Aug 01 13:18:21 <ebassi>	hotcfoch: I cannot think of any non-evil things you may want to do with that information
Aug 01 13:18:29 <ebassi>	hotcfoch: What is it that you're trying to achieve?
Aug 01 13:19:57 <swilmet>	there is a useful use-case: block all signal handlers temporarily
Aug 01 13:21:10 <swilmet>	when we set a certain value to a property temporarily (we re-set back the old value afterwards)
Aug 01 13:21:17 <hotcfoch>	ebassi: I have a attribute foo (gobject), and a method resetFoo that replaces foo by other (gobject) but keeping the connected signal handlers
Aug 01 13:24:02 <halfline>	hotcfoch: icky
Aug 01 13:24:27 <halfline>	hotcfoch: what about g_object_set_data ? what if the code that set up the handlers keeps a reference to the object outside the callback?
Aug 01 13:25:20 <halfline>	it'd be better to provide a way for the first object to subsume the data from the second object, but stick around i think.
Aug 01 13:31:43 <hotcfoch>	halfline: what info does data contain?
Aug 01 13:32:00 <halfline>	anything the user wants to put in it
Aug 01 13:34:48 <swilmet>	hotcfoch: create a property for the foo attribute, and on the notify signal the callbacks need to be connected on the new object (but this is done by the users of the class, not the class itself)
Aug 01 13:36:23 <swilmet>	hotcfoch: but it means that the users of the class need to keep around a pointer to the old object, so instead of notify, you could provide a signal foo-changed(old_foo, new_foo)
Aug 01 13:46:35 <tonyctl>	do I need to do anything special to make gtkglext work on gtk2?
Aug 01 14:02:15 <LRN>	gtk2 is soo-o-o last century
Aug 01 14:02:16 <ebassi>	tonyctl: You'll need lots of hope, most likely
Aug 01 14:02:33 <ebassi>	tonyctl: GtkGLExt hasn't been touched in many moons
Aug 01 14:02:44 <ebassi>	It *should* work
Aug 01 14:02:54 <tonyctl>	it only works in unity
Aug 01 14:03:22 <tonyctl>	I think it has something to do with compiz being an opengl compositor
Aug 01 14:03:45 <ebassi>	To be fair, anything newly written that still uses gtk2 and legacy GL in 2016 is probably not going to go far in terms of reliability and/or testing
Aug 01 14:04:01 <tonyctl>	oh it's not at all
Aug 01 14:04:06 <ebassi>	tonyctl: GL should work (on X11) regardless of the presence of a compositor
Aug 01 14:04:30 <tonyctl>	I'm getting x11 errors and my window isn't opening
Aug 01 14:04:42 <ebassi>	tonyctl: Which X11 errors are you getting?
Aug 01 14:05:14 <tonyctl>	I think they are badwindow
Aug 01 14:06:16 <ebassi>	Care to pastebin them?
Aug 01 14:07:19 <tonyctl>	X error received: type 0, serial 607, error_code 3 (BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)), request_code 1, minor_code 0
Aug 01 14:07:45 <tonyctl>	https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/issues/1946/linux-cefclient-example-hangs-when-opening
Aug 01 14:09:29 <ebassi>	Oh, ugh
Aug 01 14:09:44 <ebassi>	That's on CEF?
Aug 01 14:09:51 *	ebassi is not going to touch that
Aug 01 14:09:52 <tonyctl>	yeah
Aug 01 14:10:15 <tonyctl>	why not?
Aug 01 14:10:57 <ebassi>	Because it's a hell-hole of stuff that likely is using GTK in 20 different wrong ways
Aug 01 14:11:24 <tonyctl>	I think you are right because it doesn't work
Aug 01 14:11:26 <ebassi>	So, sorry; you'll have to debug it yourself :-/
Aug 01 14:12:22 <tonyctl>	can you give me any pointers on fixing that issue at all?
Aug 01 14:12:24 <ebassi>	It's likely something is creating a window with the wrong visual and GLX does not work; or something is passing the wrong window around
Aug 01 14:12:39 <ebassi>	"invalid Window parameter" seems to point to the latter
Aug 01 14:13:16 <ebassi>	You'll have to go around inside the code that creates the widgets and realizes them, and see which windows it creates
Aug 01 14:13:21 <tonyctl>	so the thing is that the call to `gtk_widget_show()` does nothing
Aug 01 14:13:25 <ebassi>	Other than that, I don't know
Aug 01 14:13:48 <ebassi>	tonyctl: gtk_widget_show() "just" causes a realization of the GtkWidget, and marks it as visible
Aug 01 14:14:16 <ebassi>	Look at the realize() implementation, and look at which GdkWindow it creates or uses with GtkGLExt
Aug 01 14:15:00 <ebassi>	Since GtkGLExt expects to have access to a real, native X11 window, you'll have to ensure that the window it uses is the right one
Aug 01 14:15:36 <tonyctl>	it gives me a x11 window back, but I never get a CreateNotify or MapNotify on the root window
Aug 01 14:15:54 <tonyctl>	so it's creating an id, but not the window
Aug 01 14:16:02 <tonyctl>	that id never gets into the tree
Aug 01 14:17:13 <ebassi>	Wait, are you trying to draw on the root X11 window?
Aug 01 14:17:21 <ebassi>	That's… That's not a good idea.
Aug 01 14:17:50 <tonyctl>	no, but you should get the CreateNotify when the window is created
Aug 01 14:18:20 <ebassi>	Why? The root X11 window is created by the X server
Aug 01 14:19:06 <tonyctl>	yeah and it gets notified when windows are created
Aug 01 14:19:26 <tonyctl>	try `xev -root` and then open a window and you will see a CreateNotify
Aug 01 14:19:39 <ebassi>	You need a specific event mask for that
Aug 01 14:19:55 <ebassi>	And I don't understand why you'd be creating children of the root window
Aug 01 14:20:04 <ebassi>	That only happens for top-levels
Aug 01 14:20:26 <tonyctl>	I'm just using that as evidence that the window never gets created or mapped
Aug 01 14:20:28 <ebassi>	And even then, I don't understand why you should track the creation of children of the root window, unless you're a compositor or a toolkit
Aug 01 14:21:24 <tonyctl>	it means that XCreateWindow never happens
Aug 01 14:21:51 <ebassi>	tonyctl: You could check that by looking at what calls XCreateWindow
Aug 01 14:22:02 <ebassi>	I think you're overcomplicating this by a large factor
Aug 01 14:22:31 <tonyctl>	well I'm trying to fix that bug and nothing simple has worked so far
Aug 01 14:22:45 <tonyctl>	isn't gtk supposed to call XCreateWindow behind the scenes?
Aug 01 14:23:00 <ebassi>	It depends, if the window is supposed to be backed by a native surface
Aug 01 14:23:05 <ebassi>	Which isn't the case by default
Aug 01 14:23:44 <tonyctl>	but it needs a window to show up on the screen right?
Aug 01 14:26:11 <ebassi>	Well, the top-level does
Aug 01 14:26:15 <ebassi>	Child widgets don't
Aug 01 14:26:30 <ebassi>	Some do — and GtkGLExt most definitely does
Aug 01 14:26:41 <tonyctl>	the top level is never gettings its window created
Aug 01 14:26:43 <ebassi>	But it's opt in
Aug 01 14:27:03 <tonyctl>	oh ok well maybe they're not opting in
Aug 01 14:27:09 <ebassi>	That I have more issues believing
Aug 01 14:27:15 <ebassi>	You don't see the whole window?
Aug 01 14:27:30 <tonyctl>	the first one is fine
Aug 01 14:27:50 <tonyctl>	the subsequent windows never show up
Aug 01 14:27:54 *	ebassi mutters something about being roped into debugging what he said he wouldn't debug
Aug 01 14:28:10 <tonyctl>	lol I appreciate the help though
Aug 01 14:28:23 <ebassi>	tonyctl: Then you probably want to check inside the code that creates the top levels in CEF and see what happens there
Aug 01 14:28:59 <tonyctl>	yeah I did and it looks fine
Aug 01 14:29:06 <tonyctl>	it even works on unity, but not on any other window manager
Aug 01 14:56:36 <baedert>	Let's say I'm doing a gdk_window_scrol(gtk_widget_get_window(widget), x, y) -- in gtk2 there was apparently a call to gdk_window_process_updates needed to "immediately display the result". Is that still true in gtk3?

Aug 02 00:25:30 <raymod2>	I don't see how it would matter unless the calling convention for the APIs was different.  I guess pointer arguments that are pushed onto the stack occupy 64-bits instead of 32-bits?

Aug 02 09:52:19 <baedert>	gasuleg: What do you want to display exactly? just multiline text?
Aug 02 09:55:24 <gasuleg>	I want to display some technical information in a video like the nerd stats on youtube ( you can found them in the right click menu) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkkDvKGcNSo
Aug 02 09:56:27 <baedert>	looks lik a GtkGrid and a few labels?
Aug 02 09:56:37 <gasuleg>	so basicly I want to display some text + variables 
Aug 02 09:58:06 <gasuleg>	yeah, that what I did but that not really easy to add some new element in my architecture ( add new gtklabel, add to the clutter, add to the ui file and finally set text and that for all the label
Aug 02 09:58:28 <gasuleg>	i'm think we can do that in only one widget, no?
Aug 02 09:59:17 <baedert>	You can always just draw things using cairo if you want. But you don't want to do that.
Aug 02 09:59:41 <rrika>	what is the preferrable way of spawning a process from a program with glib main loop? running g_spawn_sync on a new thread, or running g_spawn_async_with_pipes(), and putting an IO channel on its stdout?
Aug 02 10:00:08 <gasuleg>	baedert, why I don't want to? difficult?
Aug 02 10:00:48 <gasuleg>	so, the GtkTextView is not the best widget to do what I want to do?
Aug 02 10:00:59 <baedert>	gasuleg: well now you have to do layout and measuring yourself, possibly ellipsize the labels, etc.
Aug 02 10:01:15 <rudrab>	Hi, Can I have a little bit of help? I am trying to populate a treeview from a list(either parsed from file, or other source). like, https://paste.gnome.org/pz2j2bueb
Aug 02 10:03:05 <gasuleg>	baedert, I'm ok with the label. I actually display all my information with it. I just wanted to know if some widget are better for what I want to do
Aug 02 10:03:24 <rudrab>	I am not sure how to index the row properly. This method is ok if I just read from a single source. If I am trying to append the treeview, the index is 0 again.
Aug 02 10:03:33 <xjuan>	gasuleg: GtkLabel + g_strdup_printf() should do the trick
Aug 02 10:04:09 <gasuleg>	xjuan, that what I do but can you do some carriage return?
Aug 02 10:04:34 <baedert>	what do you mean by carriage return?
Aug 02 10:04:35 <xjuan>	sure why not
Aug 02 10:04:40 <xjuan>	\n
Aug 02 10:04:49 <baedert>	so still a wrapping label?
Aug 02 10:05:14 <ernestask>	\r
Aug 02 10:05:17 <ernestask>	not \n
Aug 02 10:06:00 <gasuleg>	that what I doing actually: http://pastebin.com/UgpSUjbE
Aug 02 10:06:29 <gasuleg>	to much label for what I'm doing, isn't it?
Aug 02 10:07:31 <xjuan>	hmm
Aug 02 10:07:43 <xjuan>	you are leaking memory
Aug 02 10:08:16 <xjuan>	you have to free the string returned by g_strdup_printf() once you are done with it
Aug 02 10:08:19 <xjuan>	str = g_strdup_printf ("Value one: %d\nAnother value: %d\netc", v1, v2);
Aug 02 10:08:20 <xjuan>	gtk_label_set_text (label, str);
Aug 02 10:08:22 <xjuan>	g_free (srt);
Aug 02 10:09:15 <gasuleg>	hooo, that how we use g_free, thx for that
Aug 02 10:09:43 <gasuleg>	well, I will try \n and \r
Aug 02 10:09:51 <xjuan>	you could split the format string in multiple lines to make it look better
Aug 02 10:10:08 <xjuan>	gasuleg: you do not need \r
Aug 02 10:10:22 <xjuan>	new line is enough
Aug 02 10:11:03 <gasuleg>	but.... it's not better to use only one label?
Aug 02 10:11:42 <xjuan>	no i mean something like
Aug 02 10:12:19 <xjuan>	str = g_strdup_printf ("Value one: %d\n"
Aug 02 10:12:21 <xjuan>	                       "Another value: %d\n"
Aug 02 10:12:22 <xjuan>	                       "etc", v1, v2);
Aug 02 10:13:01 <gasuleg>	yeah yeah, ok, I see
Aug 02 10:13:18 <gasuleg>	I will try that, thx for you help guys!!!
Aug 02 10:13:18 <xjuan>	btw make sure you do not have to free the string returned by SmartInfoHub::instance().callID().toStdString().c_str()
Aug 02 10:13:36 <xjuan>	you might be leaking memory there too
Aug 02 10:16:29 <gasuleg>	xjuan, you said that cause it's a string? (sorry, I'm just... noob XD)
Aug 02 10:19:54 <xjuan>	just saying you need to check the docs
Aug 02 10:20:09 <gasuleg>	ok, thx xjuan 
Aug 02 10:20:10 <xjuan>	and see what SmartInfoHub::instance().callID().toStdString().c_str() returns
Aug 02 10:20:36 <gasuleg>	well... I program it... XD he return string
Aug 02 10:20:54 <gasuleg>	and I free nothing
Aug 02 10:23:38 <xjuan>	yeah if toStdString() returns what it says it does (a std:string) then c_str() should be a pointer to the internal buffer
Aug 02 10:23:47 <xjuan>	so you do not have to free it
Aug 02 10:25:48 <rudrab>	any help please?
Aug 02 10:26:09 <gasuleg>	so with g_free (srt); what I free exactly?
Aug 02 10:33:27 <xjuan>	gasuleg: the memory allocated by g_strdup_printf() in the str pointer
Aug 02 10:34:13 <xjuan>	gasuleg: you really need to read about memory
Aug 02 10:34:48 <xjuan>	specially if you want to program in C/C++

Aug 02 13:45:47 <ebassi>	mclasen: If you want to have a look at wip/ebassi/gsk-renderer, I just landed the port of GtkBox from ::draw to ::get_render_node(), alongside with a first stab at gtk_css_gadget_get_render_node()
Aug 02 13:46:06 <mclasen>	I will, certainly!
Aug 02 13:46:19 <ebassi>	I have a small rendering artefact on the headerbar — likely some offset
Aug 02 13:46:22 <mclasen>	anything is better than poking at pixbuf loader crashes
Aug 02 13:46:26 <ebassi>	And popovers are popunders
Aug 02 13:46:51 <ebassi>	Because I need to sort them at the end of the GtkWindow get_render_node()

Aug 02 14:21:53 <baedert>	wtf
Aug 02 14:24:08 <mclasen>	ebassi: so, running GSK_DEBUG=opengl gtk3-widget-factory, I see ~13 nodes getting rendered
Aug 02 14:24:17 <mclasen>	I was expecting much more, am I missing something ?
Aug 02 14:25:06 <ebassi>	mclasen: Nope; it's just that not every widget that overrides ::draw has been ported
Aug 02 14:25:28 <ebassi>	A bunch of containers decide to chain up which is interpreted as a fallback
Aug 02 14:25:36 <mclasen>	but with GtkBox ported, shouldn't most of the widget tree be reflected in render nodes ?
Aug 02 14:26:04 <mclasen>	ah
Aug 02 14:26:12 <mclasen>	so if I see something that says Fallback<GtkFrame>
Aug 02 14:26:33 <mclasen>	that means the entire widget tree inside the frame won't show up as render nodes ?
Aug 02 14:26:35 <ebassi>	It means that everything contained inside GtkFrame is drawn to a single node
Aug 02 14:26:38 <ebassi>	Yep
Aug 02 14:27:05 <ebassi>	Working my way through the containers right now; Box was the obvious first choice because of the GtkCssGadget use
Aug 02 14:28:05 <mclasen>	I'm not sure I've seen a render node coming out of a gadget yet
Aug 02 14:28:53 <ebassi>	GtkHeaderBar should output a background and a border node
Aug 02 14:29:09 <mclasen>	right, I've seen those
Aug 02 14:29:09 <ebassi>	The log is a bit noisy with the matrices
Aug 02 14:29:17 <ebassi>	I'll split it up
Aug 02 14:30:08 <ebassi>	Bin is where things choke up because it inherits the GtkContainer::draw implementation
Aug 02 14:38:52 <mclasen>	can't it then also inherit the get_render_node implementation ?
Aug 02 14:43:23 <ebassi>	I cannot give GtkContainer a get_render_node() implementation, otherwise all GtkContainers will have it, and the fallback code that lets non-ported containers draw something will not be called
Aug 02 14:44:04 <ebassi>	But I can implement GtkBin::get_render_node()
Aug 02 14:45:26 <mclasen>	ah, ok
Aug 02 14:45:46 <mclasen>	so you're adding get_render_node implementations from the leaves of the class hierarchy upwards ?
Aug 02 14:47:33 <ebassi>	Pretty much; I'm ignoring leaf widgets right now because they would end up rendering to a texture anyway, so we can use the fallback code; I'm mostly trying to figure out a way to port containers and gadgets without adding special cases in the public API, which seems to be working

Aug 03 07:15:31 <mclasen>	the button and frame patches need more work, but the grid one is good
Aug 03 07:18:11 <ebassi>	mclasen: Yeah, I saw them; I'm going to merge the branch into mine
Aug 03 07:18:16 <ebassi>	Thanks!
Aug 03 07:18:30 <ebassi>	Any early feedback on the API?
Aug 03 07:19:55 <mclasen>	didn't really use much of it
Aug 03 07:20:42 <mclasen>	I need to sit down and actually understand the relationships between widget coordinates (allocation), gadgets, and render nodes
Aug 03 07:21:20 <ebassi>	Yeah, that's tricky; I need to write down some thought on that, and try to make it a bit more automatic
Aug 03 07:21:53 <ebassi>	There's also the whole clip != allocation thing to consider
Aug 03 07:22:24 <ebassi>	I was actually thinking of adding a function called gtk_widget_create_render_node() that set up the transformation and bounds
Aug 03 07:22:55 <mclasen>	I noticed that the 'trivial'  case basically has the same get_render_node implementation
Aug 03 07:23:14 <mclasen>	ie simple containers - you just need the gadget, and then you add the children
Aug 03 07:23:33 <mclasen>	the implementation that 'should be' gtk_container_get_render_node
Aug 03 07:24:26 <ebassi>	Yeah, we should add a gtk_container_get_render_node() that did that
Aug 03 07:24:45 <ebassi>	Or gtk_container_get_simple_render_node() :-)
Aug 03 07:25:57 <samtoday_>	Is there an idiomatic way to unfocus an entry?
Aug 03 07:26:23 <mclasen>	you can't unfocus widgets; you can only focus something else
Aug 03 07:26:50 <mclasen>	hmm
Aug 03 07:27:21 <mclasen>	jadahl: it appears we have menu placement regressions in master on wayland - is that because your part hasn't landed yet ?

Aug 03 07:28:25 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Company
Aug 03 07:30:30 <mclasen>	ebassi: the only part of that simple implementation that varies is finding the gadget
Aug 03 07:34:40 <ebassi>	Yeah, that kind of complicates things a bit
Aug 03 07:35:08 <ebassi>	Especially if we want to make that function public
Aug 03 07:55:55 <andlabs>	baedert: on Windows yes, since you have to decide what a single scrolling increment means
Aug 03 07:56:09 <andlabs>	in fact the native list box and list view controls already work like this
Aug 03 07:56:29 <andlabs>	OS X I don't think you can do it unless you effectively reimplement NSScrollView itself
Aug 03 07:56:35 <andlabs>	it works like GtkScrolledWindow
Aug 03 08:03:49 <baedert>	andlabs: How does it work on windows? Is there a GtkAdjustment equivalent? Can the increment change during scrolling does it have to stay the same?
Aug 03 08:07:12 <andlabs>	each window handle can have horizontal and vertical scrollbars provided by the system; you use the function SetScrollInfo() to set the scrolling information and actually perform scrolling in your WM_HSCROLL and WM_VSCROLL handlers
Aug 03 08:07:21 <andlabs>	the first few articles on The Old New Thing talk about it
Aug 03 08:08:14 <andlabs>	afk
Aug 03 08:11:40 <mclasen>	Company: have you looked at reftests recently ? I can't figure out why box-shadow-changes-modify-clip fails
Aug 03 08:49:20 <LRN>	something changed in latest versions of gtk?
Aug 03 08:49:47 <LRN>	it seems that gtk somehow picks up my system locale
Aug 03 08:49:56 <LRN>	that's new
Aug 03 09:09:52 <LRN>	If i create a dialog and then do "g_signal_connect (dialog, "delete-event", G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_destroy), NULL);", would it leak?
Aug 03 09:11:01 <ebassi>	LRN: Well, it would not be correct, since gtk_widget_destroy() does not have a return value and delete-event handlers expect it
Aug 03 09:11:16 <ebassi>	Also, the default delete-event handler is gtk_widget_destroy() already
Aug 03 09:22:38 <andlabs>	baedert: need any more help?
Aug 03 09:29:09 <jadahl>	mclasen: wayland uses the same method as x11, so there shouldn't be more regessions on wayland than x11 (in theory)
Aug 03 09:30:28 <baedert>	jadahl: the other day you told me that there was some private protocol that's not merged yet?
Aug 03 09:31:01 <baedert>	andlabs: I didn't really understand how that (row-based scrolling) would work from a GtkScrollable implementation
Aug 03 09:31:03 <jadahl>	baedert: indeed. except its not private
Aug 03 09:31:13 <mclasen>	jadahl: then it is probably just a regression
Aug 03 09:31:20 <jadahl>	when that has landed, and we have ported over the shell protocol to that version, we should have proper manu placement
Aug 03 09:31:29 <mclasen>	looking at widget-factory page 2, the menus pop up way too far the left
Aug 03 09:31:32 <jadahl>	now, we get "as good" as before (except there seems to be a regression)
Aug 03 09:31:42 <andlabs>	baedert: I don't know either
Aug 03 09:31:46 <andlabs>	I know I did it once, somehow
Aug 03 09:32:01 <andlabs>	I could try to dig out the code if you want
Aug 03 09:32:14 <jadahl>	mclasen: well, there was some bug olivier looked on that made thing funny on wayland but not x11, maybe its related
Aug 03 09:32:48 <jadahl>	mclasen: does it reproduce on any of the menus on testpopupat?
Aug 03 09:32:59 <mclasen>	lets try that
Aug 03 09:33:23 <jadahl>	hmm. tried it now, there seems to be some kind of regression
Aug 03 09:33:52 <jadahl>	they pop up to far to the left and to far up
Aug 03 09:34:13 <baedert>	sub menus are worse :P
Aug 03 09:34:20 <jadahl>	indeed
Aug 03 09:34:22 <mclasen>	all the menus in testpopupat seem somewhat broken
Aug 03 09:34:34 <mclasen>	the menubuttons mostly work
Aug 03 09:35:33 <jadahl>	the application menu page does not however
Aug 03 09:36:02 <mclasen>	works fine under X, afaics
Aug 03 09:36:24 <jadahl>	will take a look
Aug 03 09:36:24 <mclasen>	uh, there's more tabs
Aug 03 09:36:33 <mclasen>	this thing tests _all the menus_!
Aug 03 09:36:44 <jadahl>	yea its awesome
Aug 03 09:36:51 <jadahl>	it even has the super tall menu
Aug 03 09:36:53 <jadahl>	and super deep
Aug 03 09:38:09 <mclasen>	there's something fishy with the filechooser sidebar - don't get the context menu popover there
Aug 03 09:38:24 <jadahl>	on x11?
Aug 03 09:38:29 <mclasen>	both
Aug 03 09:38:42 <mclasen>	instead, I get something that looks like a notebook tab menu

Aug 03 09:41:26 <visarion>	I have a box with to objects in it. One of it is always shown and the other's visibility is toggled on/off. How do I make sure that the first one doesn't move when the other one is shown/not shown ?
Aug 03 09:42:29 <baedert>	you can put the second in a stack and control the visibility using that
Aug 03 10:35:19 <andlabs>	baedert: if you're still interested here's a shell archive with the code I had for line-based scrolling http://sprunge.us/QfAR but you'll have to figure it out at this point, sorry

Aug 03 12:41:19 <pmike>	Hi, not sure if this is the right place but can i make question regarding GIO (Sockets) in here?
Aug 03 12:44:06 <fmuellner>	yup
Aug 03 12:44:32 <pmike>	Ok @fmueliner, thanks.
Aug 03 12:44:53 <pmike>	I'm working on a App that runs ok on GTK3.18 but it fails on 3.20
Aug 03 12:45:38 <pmike>	been following the problem and it comes to attaching a source, or a SocketSource more precisely on to a socket
Aug 03 12:47:07 <pmike>	went to github to check gsocket.c and it seems that the g_socket_create_source has started to return null if the socket is a TCP (stream) socket instead of a UDP (Datagram)
Aug 03 12:48:53 <pmike>	i'm trying to read any document suggestion how to handle this but cannot find anything
Aug 03 12:50:02 <pmike>	the idea is, after connecting to a server, get the socket, create a source and set a callback to the IOCondition.IN
Aug 03 12:50:44 <pmike>	but the create_source will return NULL if the Socket type is TCP... Is this normal?
Aug 03 12:52:09 <pmike>	well, it wasn't but it is now. And the documentation says that the DatagramBased interface will work on both (connection oriented and connection-less) kind of streams
Aug 03 12:58:29 <pmike>	i can get more detailed if needed... my first time on IRC, *blush*
Aug 03 12:59:43 <mclasen>	I think the datagrambased stuff was done by pwithnall 
Aug 03 12:59:49 <mclasen>	maybe he can chime in
Aug 03 13:00:14 <pwithnall>	hello
Aug 03 13:00:18 <pmike>	Hi
Aug 03 13:01:10 *	pwithnall takes a look at the code
Aug 03 13:01:20 <pmike>	thanks @mclasen and @pwithnall
Aug 03 13:03:14 <nicknameitis>	is it possible to invoke gtk-inspector from my code with already specific object selected?
Aug 03 13:03:26 <pwithnall>	pmike: I don’t see how it’s possible for g_socket_create_source() to return NULL
Aug 03 13:03:50 <pwithnall>	unless you’re violating one of its preconditions, in which case you should get a critical warning
Aug 03 13:05:33 <pmike>	pwithnall: thanks for your time. What i'm doing it's simple, use g_socket_client to connect and get a g_socket_connection
Aug 03 13:05:52 <pmike>	from the g_socket_connection, get the g_socket
Aug 03 13:06:30 <baedert>	nicknameitis: no
Aug 03 13:06:55 <pmike>	then i try to create a source, from the socket, g_socket_create_source with IOCondition IN
Aug 03 13:07:07 <pmike>	but it return null
Aug 03 13:07:53 <pwithnall>	pmike: have you checked that the GSocket is non-NULL?
Aug 03 13:07:55 <nicknameitis>	baedert: this sucks, i'll have to reinvent whole thing. thanks
Aug 03 13:08:07 <pwithnall>	because that’s the only reason I can see for g_socket_create_source() to return NULL
Aug 03 13:08:14 <pmike>	yes, it's non-null
Aug 03 13:09:05 <pmike>	with gtk 3.18 (fedora 23) it's working but fails on gtk 3.20 (fedora 24)
Aug 03 13:10:47 <pmike>	on gsocket.c has a condition now "if (!check_datagram_based (self, null)) return NULL;
Aug 03 13:11:45 <pmike>	and this function will return false on: case G_SOCKET_TYPE_STREAM
Aug 03 13:12:25 <pwithnall>	pmike: You’re calling g_datagram_based_create_source(), not g_socket_create_source()?
Aug 03 13:12:31 <pmike>	pwithnall: i'm not sure, i was just trying to figure out why... i may be wrong on my assumptions
Aug 03 13:13:43 <pmike>	well, i'm using Vala, let me check which one is being called on thec generated file
Aug 03 13:14:19 <pwithnall>	g_datagram_based_create_source() is what’s being called
Aug 03 13:14:48 <pwithnall>	The code is correct, and the documentation which says GDatagramBased works for connection-oriented and connection-less objects is also correct, although not especially helpful
Aug 03 13:15:08 <pwithnall>	GDatagramBased explicitly does not work with stream-based objects, such as TCP connections
Aug 03 13:15:35 <pmike>	yes and i understand the logic
Aug 03 13:15:40 <pwithnall>	Note that you can have a connection-oriented, non-stream-based connection: SCTP is an example
Aug 03 13:15:46 <pwithnall>	I’ll clarify that documentation
Aug 03 13:16:34 <pmike>	yes, i know but i'm using TCP and the set_callback on a socket seems to appear only on the GDatagramBased interface
Aug 03 13:17:25 <pwithnall>	You mean the create_source() only seems to appear on the GDatagramBased interface?
Aug 03 13:18:04 <pwithnall>	My Vala is rusty, but I think the following should work:
Aug 03 13:18:17 <pwithnall>	(my_socket_variable as GLib.Socket).create_source(…)
Aug 03 13:19:02 <pmike>	http://www.valadate.org:8000/#!api=gio-2.0/GLib.Socket
Aug 03 13:19:34 <pmike>	the create_source method moved to the DatagramBased interface
Aug 03 13:19:45 <pmike>	maybe it's a vala/valac problem
Aug 03 13:19:58 <smcv>	if a class C implements an interface I
Aug 03 13:20:08 <smcv>	and both C and I have a create_source() method
Aug 03 13:20:22 <smcv>	I would expect my_C_instance.create_source() to mean C.create_source, not I.create_source
Aug 03 13:20:41 <smcv>	just from a general argument of "interfaces are a bit like base classes"
Aug 03 13:20:49 <smcv>	but perhaps Vala doesn't follow that rule
Aug 03 13:21:33 <pwithnall>	it might require an override
Aug 03 13:21:40 <smcv>	if Vala doesn't do that, it seems like a recipe for accidental API changes - implementing a new interface shouldn't make your Vala API magically change
Aug 03 13:21:52 <smcv>	surely?
Aug 03 13:22:19 <pwithnall>	pmike: I think you need to file a bug against Vala; this definitely looks like a Vala bug to me
Aug 03 13:22:44 <pmike>	i also come from gtk/glib on C but i'm on a project, alone, and i needed to speedup the coding so i turned to vala
Aug 03 13:23:08 <smcv>	you had a problem, you solved it with vala, and now you have a different problem
Aug 03 13:23:17 <smcv>	not an unfamiliar story tbh
Aug 03 13:23:43 <pmike>	ok, just check the 3.18 c and 3.20
Aug 03 13:24:02 <pmike>	the 3.20 it's using g_datagram_based_create_cource
Aug 03 13:24:07 <pmike>	*source
Aug 03 13:25:19 <pmike>	i must check with the vala guys then, thanks pwithnall and smcv
Aug 03 13:25:26 <pwithnall>	np
Aug 03 13:25:29 <pmike>	sorry fot the time taken
Aug 03 13:25:30 <pwithnall>	Good luck
Aug 03 13:25:39 <pmike>	thanks ;) keep up the good work 
Aug 03 14:21:01 <LRN>	when is the next gtk release?
Aug 03 14:21:39 <mclasen>	you mean the next devel snapshot, or the next stable release ?
Aug 03 14:21:49 <LRN>	stable
Aug 03 14:22:02 <LRN>	roadmap doesn't seem to have any dates anymore
Aug 03 14:23:12 <mclasen>	not sure it ever had forward-looking dates
Aug 03 14:23:22 <mclasen>	anyway, Sep 21
Aug 03 14:24:02 <LRN>	okay
Aug 03 14:30:20 <jmd>	How do I define accelerators in a GMenuModel ?
Aug 03 14:47:27 <jmd>	I have tried to set a keyboard accelerator in my app like this:    const gchar *xx[]={"<Ctrl>Q", 0};
Aug 03 14:47:27 <jmd>	  gtk_application_set_accels_for_action (GTK_APPLICATION (app), "quit", xx);
Aug 03 14:47:27 <jmd>	 
Aug 03 14:47:42 <jmd>	But it doesn't seem to do anything.  What have I missed?
Aug 03 14:51:56 <mclasen>	impossible to answer that. compare https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/examples/bp/bloatpad.c for a working example

Aug 04 01:41:32 <kung>	I have a GtkVBox, which has a statusbar, which is always at bottom, tho I wanna add a widget after it, but the new widget is always added before
Aug 04 01:41:41 <kung>	is this a pack-type "issue"?
Aug 04 01:41:49 <kung>	I tried: gtk_container_child_set(GTK_CONTAINER(gtk_widget_get_parent(statusbar)), statusbar, "pack-type", GTK_PACK_START, NULL);

Aug 04 01:47:31 <kung>	LRN, oh thanks for the glade tip, I just realized in glade that pack-type means something different what I thought xD
Aug 04 01:48:18 <kung>	I thought it's forcing a widget to be always "last" in box, but it actually just means it located at bottom 
Aug 04 01:49:37 <kung>	oh or not

Aug 04 06:43:47 <mclasen>	ebassi: I tracked down the headerbar positioning
Aug 04 06:44:37 <ebassi>	mclasen: Oh, thanks; was going over the coordinate space issues today — spent some time in the profiler yesterday
Aug 04 06:46:57 <mclasen>	pushed a possible fix in my branch
Aug 04 06:47:35 <ebassi>	Cool, I'm looking at it right now
Aug 04 06:48:58 <ebassi>	I wonder if we shouldn't just add the offset to the transformation matrix when setting it up
Aug 04 06:49:24 <ebassi>	But I'll have a got at it
Aug 04 06:49:26 <ebassi>	Thanks again!
Aug 04 06:51:04 *	ebassi needs to figure out why the first frame on hidpi is painted correctly and every other frame is not
Aug 04 06:51:36 <mclasen>	there may be other places where we need to handle the clip / allocation discrepancy
Aug 04 06:52:26 <mclasen>	I haven't looked at what the css render nodes do wrt to outer shadows, e.g
Aug 04 06:56:08 <ebassi>	In theory, that's what the bounds.origin should do — an additional translation applied when rendering. I'm likely not applying it correctly, especially when it's negative.
Aug 04 06:56:48 <mclasen>	the problem I found is that gtk_widget_get_render_node sets it right
Aug 04 06:57:01 <mclasen>	and gtk_container_propagate_render_nodes overrides it wrong
Aug 04 06:58:04 <mclasen>	splitting out that offset was a way to avoid that interference
Aug 04 06:58:20 <ebassi>	Likely something I misunderstood from the code in gtk_container_propagate_draw()
Aug 04 06:59:04 <mclasen>	no, I think the code is right
Aug 04 06:59:24 <mclasen>	it positions children according to their allocation
Aug 04 06:59:56 <mclasen>	just that when you have a nontrivial clip, the top left corner of the allocation can not be where you position your surface, in must extend beyond that
Aug 04 07:04:17 <ebassi>	The "bounds" of a GskRenderNode are the equivalent of the clip - the renderable area, including an eventual offset to be applied on top of the transformation of the top-left corner. Render nodes also have a child transform, which is applied to children only, on top of their own transformation.
Aug 04 07:04:31 <ebassi>	Containers should undo the clip offset as part of the child transformation
Aug 04 07:04:59 <ebassi>	So that children get drawn where their allocation is, but their renderable area can have a different offset
Aug 04 07:05:43 <ebassi>	Would that make sense?
Aug 04 07:07:25 <mclasen>	I briefly looked at the child transform, but couldn't see any use of it; I guess that would work fine
Aug 04 07:07:42 <mclasen>	although I'm not sure in what sense one of these transform is 'child' and the other isn't
Aug 04 08:41:16 <rrika>	Is it acceptable to call XGetWindowProperty on the UI thread?
Aug 04 08:41:39 <rrika>	I was wondering if there was an asynchronous version of this
Aug 04 08:55:39 <baedert>	Does the GtkCssValue redefinition in all the c files also confuse gdb?
Aug 04 09:06:48 <ebassi>	rrika: You can only call it inside the GUI thread; any other use is undefined behaviour
Aug 04 09:06:58 <ebassi>	rrika: XCB has asynchronous variants
Aug 04 09:07:39 <rrika>	gtk/gdk uses xlib, right? so I can't use xcb on the same connection, right?
Aug 04 09:10:35 <mclasen>	why are you worried about XGetWindowProperty being sync ?
Aug 04 09:12:00 <rrika>	I'm just generally wary about everything that's sync on a UI thread. I didn't bench anything.
Aug 04 09:12:08 <rrika>	If it's not a problem in practice then that's fine too.
Aug 04 09:14:03 <mclasen>	its not something I would worry about

Aug 04 09:16:08 <rrika>	okay
Aug 04 09:20:10 <Redfoxmoon>	...
Aug 04 09:20:41 <Redfoxmoon>	Is there anything in glib's build system with regards to libtool causing race conditions?
Aug 04 09:21:32 *	mclasen not sure how anyone would answer that
Aug 04 09:23:18 <xjuan>	fmuellner: hola!, how are you? did you have time to take a look at the issue I mention the other day?
Aug 04 09:23:23 <andlabs>	question for others I guess http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38765080/delete-the-automatic-popover-shown-on-gtk-entry
Aug 04 09:23:34 <andlabs>	never heard of this before
Aug 04 09:23:35 <fmuellner>	xjuan: no, sorry
Aug 04 09:23:48 <xjuan>	no problem, do you have any pointers?
Aug 04 09:24:17 <baedert>	andlabs: that should only appear if a touchscreen is in use and in that case can't be deleted.
Aug 04 09:28:25 <mclasen>	more precisely, it should only appear if the entry sees touch events
Aug 04 09:28:38 <mclasen>	I don't think we show it on focus-in
Aug 04 09:30:30 <Redfoxmoon>	mclasen, was that /me for me? :p
Aug 04 09:30:39 <mclasen>	yes
Aug 04 09:30:54 <Redfoxmoon>	right, so...asking because there's a new C implementation of libtool
Aug 04 09:31:09 <Redfoxmoon>	which, when used with glib causes race conditions
Aug 04 09:31:12 <mclasen>	first time I hear about it, have a pointer ?
Aug 04 09:31:19 <Redfoxmoon>	*only* glib, no other packages
Aug 04 09:31:22 <Redfoxmoon>	Oh, right, yes, sec
Aug 04 09:31:51 <Redfoxmoon>	mclasen, http://midipix.org/ http://git.midipix.org/cgit.cgi/slibtool
Aug 04 09:31:53 <mclasen>	but my basic take on that would be: you replaced one piece in a very complicated puzzle, and now there's a problem... I would start by looking at the new piece
Aug 04 09:31:53 <Redfoxmoon>	:-)
Aug 04 09:32:05 <Redfoxmoon>	oh, it's been looked into a lot..
Aug 04 09:32:31 <Redfoxmoon>	a bunch of race conditions have been fixed, but glib remains
Aug 04 09:33:43 <mclasen>	on a meta-level I think replacing libtool with a new implementation is missing the larger picture...
Aug 04 09:34:01 <mclasen>	the problem with libtool is not so much that it is written in shell
Aug 04 09:34:07 <bugbot>	bugzilla@tecnocode.co.uk changed the Status on bug 769507 from NEW --- to RESOLVED FIXED.

Aug 04 09:34:08 <mclasen>	but that it shouldn't really exist in the first place
Aug 04 09:40:41 <Redfoxmoon>	mclasen, it does exist, and has limitations
Aug 04 09:40:59 <Redfoxmoon>	like being unable to make shared libraries when cross compiling, slibtool doesn't care about that
Aug 04 09:41:02 <Redfoxmoon>	speed, etc
Aug 04 09:41:18 <Redfoxmoon>	of course if we COULD remove libtool from existence, that would be the best solution; but we can't
Aug 04 09:44:32 <smcv>	"unable to make shared libraries when cross compiling" [citation needed]
Aug 04 09:44:54 <Redfoxmoon>	smcv, just try building a library with libtool for midipix by cross compilation.
Aug 04 09:44:58 <Redfoxmoon>	you will not get a shared library :-)
Aug 04 09:45:05 <smcv>	I have no idea what midipix is
Aug 04 09:45:17 <smcv>	but every libdbus commit builds shared libraries for Windows on travis-ci
Aug 04 09:45:25 <Redfoxmoon>	libtool goes "hmmm....I don't know this platform, therefore no shared libraries!"
Aug 04 09:45:35 <Redfoxmoon>	midipix is a POSIX layer for windows
Aug 04 09:45:44 <Redfoxmoon>	unlike cygwin, it doesn't suck :-)
Aug 04 09:46:02 <smcv>	if you take a tool that contains knowledge of platform-specific quirks
Aug 04 09:46:12 <smcv>	and try to use it for a platform it doesn't know about
Aug 04 09:46:18 <Redfoxmoon>	it shouldn't matter
Aug 04 09:46:19 <smcv>	you are not going to have a good time
Aug 04 09:46:25 <Redfoxmoon>	uhm.
Aug 04 09:46:37 <Redfoxmoon>	libtool shouldn't go to a "known list for shared libraries"
Aug 04 09:46:53 <smcv>	knowing which hoops you need to jump through to get a shared library, on which platforms, is exactly the point of libtool
Aug 04 09:46:53 <Redfoxmoon>	it COULD check against a list of broken platforms, sure
Aug 04 09:47:09 <Redfoxmoon>	normal PE target
Aug 04 09:47:23 <Redfoxmoon>	"libtool: different triplet, therefore NOPE."
Aug 04 09:47:26 <Redfoxmoon>	uh.
Aug 04 09:47:27 <smcv>	now, perhaps the world has got better since libtool started, and "most" relevant platforms can be lumped into equivalence classes
Aug 04 09:47:39 <Redfoxmoon>	it has AFAIK
Aug 04 09:47:45 <Redfoxmoon>	most platforms are sane :(
Aug 04 09:50:15 <andlabs>	what do you mean
Aug 04 09:50:20 <andlabs>	we still need to support xenix and 2.2BSD
Aug 04 09:50:32 <Redfoxmoon>	:-)
Aug 04 09:50:44 <Redfoxmoon>	trololo
Aug 04 09:51:32 <andlabs>	when will gtk3 for amiga workbench be out =P
Aug 04 09:51:41 <mclasen>	anyway, to get back to the beginning of this discussion, I think showing the failure you see might be more productive than asking about race conditions in general
Aug 04 09:59:49 <gnunn>	I've got a user complaining about huge icons in GTK 3.16 when using my app. The app uses custom SVG icons and only my custom icons are showing up huge, the icons taken from the theme are the correct size. Any chance this is a known issue in GTK 3.16? Here's my bug report: https://github.com/gnunn1/terminix/issues/428
Aug 04 10:01:01 <gnunn>	I went through bugzilla and while there are some bug reports for huge icons they all seem to be all or nothing, i.e. all icons are huge, whereas in my case some icons are huge some are normal
Aug 04 10:01:47 <baedert>	gnunn: are you storing symbolic icons in scalable/?
Aug 04 10:02:30 <gnunn>	baedert: They are in a scaleable folder in my resource file yes. It works fine in other GTK versions as far as I can tell
Aug 04 10:03:13 <baedert>	gnunn: opensuse sets the min size of scalable/ to 64px
Aug 04 10:03:30 <baedert>	you have to use symbolic/ for symbolics
Aug 04 10:03:49 <baedert>	which increases the icon theme spec whatever package version you need because symbolic/ only exists in the latest version
Aug 04 10:04:07 <baedert>	... which you can work around by using symbolic pngs
Aug 04 10:04:22 <gnunn>	baedert: I think mine are smaller then that
Aug 04 10:04:47 <baedert>	then 32, doesn't matter
Aug 04 10:05:02 <baedert>	https://github.com/baedert/corebird/issues/451
Aug 04 10:05:52 <gnunn>	baedert: Thanks very much for that link, this saves me a ton of time in trying to figure out the problem!
Aug 04 10:07:48 <baedert>	gnunn: The end result was https://github.com/baedert/corebird/commit/84a11623e24ac3bd58a86847b7262d373005eb53 ...
Aug 04 10:10:06 <gnunn>	baedert: OK, that seems pretty reasonable. Thanks again for this, saves me a ton of time
Aug 04 10:17:44 <Redfoxmoon>	mclasen, will try do that later and post the log
Aug 04 10:42:50 <al>	can a GSocket of type G_SOCKET_TYPE_STREAM be used with g_dtls_server_connection_new ?

Aug 04 11:41:17 <baedert>	Company: Also, totally unrelated, but do you want to look into bug 763517? :)
Aug 04 11:41:18 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=763517 .General, normal, gtk-bugs, NEEDINFO , Selected sidebar item in file chooser briefly has wrong color on cursor leave
Aug 04 11:43:58 <al>	thanks pmike, i dont' think GSocket should implement GDatagramBased interface. Not all sockets are DatagramBased, e.g. TCP.
Aug 04 11:44:00 <al>	There should be a new object GDatagramBasedSocket that inherits from GSocket and implements GDatagramBased. This will GError if try to create TCP socket with it. The changes to GSocket are causing problems with Vala. The idea of a conditional interface based on constructor argument is dubious in my view
Aug 04 11:52:11 <pwithnall>	al: It’s not a conditional interface, it’s an interface which will return an error if you call its methods on a stream-based socket
Aug 04 11:52:29 <pwithnall>	It’s no worse than socket() being a gateway to all sorts of different types of connections with totally different semantics
Aug 04 11:53:04 <pwithnall>	and I suspect less painful than having a DatagramBased and StreamBased copy of a lot of classes and interfaces
Aug 04 11:53:54 <pwithnall>	But to answer your original question, as pmike said: you cannot use a stream-based socket with GDtlsServerConnection
Aug 04 11:54:03 <pwithnall>	It will throw errors as soon as you try sending or receiving data
Aug 04 11:54:21 <al>	hmm, if it errors then it doesn't implement the method so it is not implementing the interface. my understanding was that GObject brought OOP methods to C. this seems like a corruption of that
Aug 04 11:55:25 <al>	and makes it difficult for bindings
Aug 04 11:55:56 <al>	what purpose does the interface serve?
Aug 04 11:57:55 <DimStar>	Hi all. the fresh 3.20.7 tarball is 'broken' insofar that it requires an unstable glib2 version due to https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/configure.ac?h=gtk-3-20&id=a01ee5a7b0a9a7170d4be3c64314ee51dd502cab
Aug 04 12:47:01 <nacho_>	LRN, sorry for the late response

Aug 04 12:48:49 <mclasen>	DimStar: arr, I meant to skip that
Aug 04 12:49:17 <DimStar>	mclasen: I was pretty sure you did not mean to require an unstale glib in stable gtk
Aug 04 12:50:29 <mclasen>	reverted
Aug 04 12:51:05 <DimStar>	will you do a new release tarball or shall I just revert it in the packages too?
Aug 04 12:51:21 <mclasen>	let me do that quickly
Aug 04 13:15:47 <heftig>	mclasen: gtk 3.20.7 depends on glib 2.29.1
Aug 04 13:15:56 <heftig>	er, 2.49.1

Aug 04 15:19:27 <tobias47n9e>	What is the GTK locale for Dari language? fa_AF does not seem to work.
Aug 04 15:21:32 <mclasen>	we do have a fa.po
Aug 04 15:24:07 <tobias47n9e>	mclasen, fa starts with RTL but fa_AF not. Is that maybe a bug?
Aug 04 15:25:08 <mclasen>	both fa and fa_AF come up in rtl here
Aug 04 15:26:14 <tobias47n9e>	mclasen, Thanks. I guess then it is an issue on my side
Aug 04 15:27:02 <mclasen>	how are you setting it ? my guess would be that setlocale fails for one of your two tries
Aug 04 15:34:38 <jmd>	What's the shift key called in Variant speak?
Aug 04 15:37:03 <tobias47n9e>	mclasen, Now I know what the problem is. fa_AF in Windows 7 is prs_AF
Aug 04 15:37:39 <tobias47n9e>	I will have to catch all of these differing local labels
Aug 04 15:37:55 <mclasen>	ugh

Aug 04 16:06:31 <tonyctl>	is it possible to hide a gtk window with css?
Aug 04 16:27:34 <hergertme>	tonyctl: no
Aug 04 16:28:13 <tonyctl>	can I make it transparent enough to be invisible?
Aug 04 16:28:42 <hergertme>	you might need to make sure it has an rgba visual (although maybe that is default by now?)
Aug 04 16:29:54 <hergertme>	hrmm, setting the opacity property works for me, but not window { opacity: 0.3 }
Aug 04 16:30:07 <hergertme>	probably due to visuals

Aug 04 17:42:58 <garnacho>	b4n: yeah, I'll push to gtk-3-20 too, not sure the previous will get that much further attention
Aug 04 17:43:38 <b4n>	well, I would hope for things like Ubuntu to update to a newer 3.18 if it happened
Aug 04 17:44:02 <b4n>	maybe I'm too optimistic about them, but well
Aug 04 17:50:07 <rudrab>	Do I must have a liststore defined for this?
Aug 04 17:53:19 <b4n>	rudrab: if you don't have a liststore how do you use the renderer?  but no, you can g_object_set(renderer, "pixbuf", pixbuf, NULL);
Aug 04 18:11:49 <rudrab>	b4n: like this: https://paste.gnome.org/pdxowpffm

Aug 05 02:38:55 <rudrab>	I am trying https://paste.gnome.org/pps9ccnwe
Aug 05 02:40:19 <TingPing>	rudrab, just make two renderers and pack them both in
Aug 05 02:40:40 <TingPing>	rudrab, an example: https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/treeview.html#the-view
Aug 05 02:41:54 <rudrab>	TingPing: I am trying to do that ...the problem is, is it possible to load data to cellrenderer without a liststore? e.g. set_property?
Aug 05 02:42:20 <rudrab>	see the code please
Aug 05 02:43:50 <TingPing>	rudrab, sure, but the property you want is probably "icon-name"

Aug 05 02:50:28 <rudrab>	https://paste.gnome.org/phmomfmiv is what I am trying to do....a cellrenderercombo. The icons is working great, but that is not clickable
Aug 05 02:51:33 <rudrab>	I am trying to get the icon clickable, not the text (both is ok)
Aug 05 02:51:54 <TingPing>	is the text clickable?
Aug 05 02:52:51 <rudrab>	yes
Aug 05 02:53:32 <rudrab>	when i click the text, the on_combo_changed works
Aug 05 02:53:35 <TingPing>	hmm, well im not certain the best solution, but you could probably just connect to the clicked signal of the treeview and if its the icon activate the combo instead
Aug 05 02:56:53 <rudrab>	hmm...already did that...unfortunately CellRendererPixbuf does not have a clicled/edited signal
Aug 05 02:57:08 <TingPing>	that is why i sad the treeview
Aug 05 03:00:28 <rudrab>	Actually it should open a cellrenderercombo

Aug 05 07:17:51 <mclasen>	I may look at it a bit
Aug 05 07:18:00 <mclasen>	we may just be clipping them away
Aug 05 07:18:16 <ebassi>	Yeah, it's probably a case of missing clip
Aug 05 07:18:31 <ebassi>	i.e. using the allocation instead of the clip to determine the size of the node
Aug 05 07:18:52 <ebassi>	The frame rendering is also a bit bust: the label is drawn over the frame border

Aug 05 22:56:42 <jmd>	Where is the format for the attribute name="accel" properties of GMenuModel documented ?
Aug 06 03:00:59 <rudrab>	Hi, given the CellRendererCombo remains almost hidden (no visual for presence of a combo, eg. dropdown arrow of a normal combobox), I am trying to add a pixbuf in the same cell
Aug 06 03:01:28 <rudrab>	e.g. https://paste.gnome.org/ptnqluhzf
Aug 06 03:02:09 <rudrab>	problem is the cellrendererpixbuf is not clickable. any idea how to use it?
Aug 06 03:05:25 <rudrab>	http://picpaste.com/Screenshot_from_2016-08-06_09-02-41-kxfR8zgu.png is how my corresponding treeviewcolumn is. 
Aug 06 03:05:59 <TingPing>	rudrab, the index is what has a combo?
Aug 06 03:06:11 <rudrab>	yes
Aug 06 03:06:32 <TingPing>	rudrab, seems like drag n drop is a better way to set an order than a combobox
Aug 06 03:07:02 <TingPing>	though i suppose it might be resortable
Aug 06 03:08:47 <rudrab>	so, you mean there is no easy way to make the pixbuf clickable (or the full TreeViewColumn)?
Aug 06 03:09:39 <TingPing>	well i told you an option yesterday
Aug 06 03:11:29 <rudrab>	TingPing:True, but was not very clear to me..as you can see, I am still fighting
Aug 06 03:14:42 <rudrab>	I have tried making the column clickable. as column_combo.connect("clicked", self.on_combo_changed)
Aug 06 03:14:49 <rudrab>	but no effect
Aug 06 03:15:38 <TingPing>	rudrab, well, at a glance the rough details is, 'button-press-event' of the view, then get_path_at_pos(), somehow get that to a cellrenderer, and call activate() on the combo
Aug 06 03:16:48 <TingPing>	if i were you i just wouldn't shove an icon there, i don't think it makes it much more clear
Aug 06 03:17:10 <TingPing>	if the view isn't sortable, just enable drag n drop and that solves that
Aug 06 03:24:59 <rudrab>	TingPing: tell me one thing, plz
Aug 06 03:26:00 <rudrab>	The TreeViewColumn is clickable; and I have added one more widget(the cellpixbuf) to the column. 
Aug 06 03:26:28 <rudrab>	So, should it not have the properties of the treeviewcolumn?
Aug 06 03:27:19 <TingPing>	clickability of columns refers to the header
Aug 06 03:28:09 <TingPing>	as the docs say: http://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/index.html#Gtk-3.0/classes/TreeViewColumn.html#Gtk.TreeViewColumn.props.clickable
Aug 06 03:34:31 <rudrab>	one last help: is it possible to make the pixbuf clickable, not the int itself?
Aug 06 06:19:21 <heftig>	qt5, chrome and firefox can all display colored emoji, now just gtk seems be missing here
Aug 06 06:45:55 <jmd>	heftig: Gtk+ copes well with colours for me.
Aug 06 06:46:10 <heftig>	jmd: perhaps that is new in 3.21
Aug 06 06:46:34 <jmd>	Err.  I think it's been like that at least since 2.0
Aug 06 06:46:47 <jmd>	Maybe you have a configuration issue.
Aug 06 06:47:17 <heftig>	wat
Aug 06 06:48:00 <heftig>	jmd: i'm pretty sure this is a problem that goes deep down the stack into cairo, which can't load colored glyphs
Aug 06 06:48:12 <heftig>	that is, colored glyphs are converted to grayscale
Aug 06 06:48:52 <jmd>	I don't know about that.  There are so many different standards for fonts.
Aug 06 06:49:27 <heftig>	i'm having that behavior with both "Noto Color Emoji" and "Apple Color Emoji"
Aug 06 06:49:42 <jmd>	I don't know what they are.
Aug 06 06:52:04 <heftig>	jmd: emoji fonts
Aug 06 06:53:33 <jmd>	Again, I'm not a font expert.  But I know there are so many "standards" and non-standards for fonts, so you could be right.  Perhaps this particular class of font is not fully supported.
Aug 06 06:53:56 <TingPing>	heftig, behdad has certainly mentioned it, no clue if anything came from that
Aug 06 06:54:48 <heftig>	jmd: you do know what i'm talking about?
Aug 06 06:55:29 <jmd>	I guess the thing is, if some random person suddenly announces "Hey! I have invented a new standard for fonts", it is unreasonable to expect the Gtk devs to drop everything and suddenly implement that standard.
Aug 06 06:55:32 <TingPing>	heftig, https://lists.cairographics.org/archives/cairo/2016-April/027357.html
Aug 06 06:56:34 <heftig>	jmd: no, the colored glyph loading is implemented in freetype
Aug 06 06:56:45 <heftig>	TingPing: thanks
Aug 06 07:42:11 <hadess>	heftig, you should read my blog post, which explains the different font standards, and how to get colour emojis in gtk+
Aug 06 10:24:33 *	ChanServ sets mode +q on #gtk+ Company
Aug 06 10:24:33 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Company
Aug 06 11:55:40 <ic2000>	ah found the right channel. i've just got a little question; how is the performance of gtk applications on windows? i've heard it has a bad reputation and i'm just here to confirm if it's as slow as people say
Aug 06 12:55:01 <pmike>	ic2000: not sure what you mean by slow, just try, for example, gimp on windows and take your conclusions
Aug 06 13:00:49 <ic2000>	pmike, yeah i've used it quite a lot. the loading times are quite slow, i'm not sure if this is gtks fault or the application design itself
Aug 06 13:01:27 <pmike>	is your pc old somehow? other software runs good quit?
Aug 06 13:02:22 <baedert>	gimp startup times are long because of all the plugins etc.
Aug 06 13:02:24 <pmike>	in my experiencie i see no difference but there are many variables that can change ones experience
Aug 06 13:04:30 <ic2000>	pmike, nah my pc is definitely not old lol - another thing is photoshop loads twice as fast. but i think baedert's conclusion could be the case
Aug 06 13:05:25 <pmike>	indeed, instead of the loading, check how the application performs while working, does it seems slow? slow rendering?, slow mouse and high cpu?
Aug 06 13:05:41 <baedert>	... and then remember that gimp is gtk2
Aug 06 13:05:48 <pmike>	exactly
Aug 06 13:06:42 <ic2000>	pmike, apart from the loading and some certain art options (like cubify) it works fine
Aug 06 13:06:53 <ic2000>	i was also told to use gtk2 over gtk3 as it's less bloated?
Aug 06 13:07:39 <baedert>	mitch: ... which reminds me that I have a rebased version of the gtk3-port branch (with a few additional commits). The rebase is not perfect and needed a fixup later but not sure how important that is to you
Aug 06 13:07:42 <pmike>	some plugins are cpu intensive, it's normal. Also, dont forget that gimp, unlike photoshop, it's not a commercial grade software, there are differences
Aug 06 13:08:39 <baedert>	ic2000: if you never ever want to change your codebase, gtk2 is perfect
Aug 06 13:09:26 <ic2000>	baedert, i don't have a codebase :) i'm looking for a gui lib to use. it's either learn C++ and use Qt, or use gtk and C
Aug 06 13:09:31 <ic2000>	i really don't want to learn C++ atm
Aug 06 13:09:41 <pmike>	ic2000: depends on your goals with gtk
Aug 06 13:10:04 <pmike>	ic2000: gtk has bindings to a lot of languages
Aug 06 13:10:30 <pmike>	dont need to go to gtkmm
Aug 06 13:10:53 <baedert>	if less "bloat" is you only goal you might as well just use ncurses.
Aug 06 13:11:05 <pmike>	xD
Aug 06 13:44:36 <mitch>	baedert: i meant to rebase it soon, too, dunno what is "not perfect", but maybe you can drop me the additional commits?
Aug 06 13:46:04 <mitch>	ic2000: when somebody says "bloat", stop listening to them
Aug 06 13:58:22 <baedert>	mitch: well there's one "Fix build" commit after the rebase :)
Aug 06 13:58:49 <mitch>	baedert: i guess i'll hit that myself
Aug 06 14:13:21 <baedert>	mitch: https://paste.xinu.at/m-OeLL/ Some of those are silly but 0252 was particularly tricky to track down.
Aug 06 14:18:40 <arun>	Hi, I'm usig a flowbox and am backaging a boxes in it, each box has itself several boxes again. When I use the cursors to move around, I would like it to only iterate over the flowbox children, but it also goes a level deeper and iterates over the box children... how do I disable this?

Aug 07 15:17:14 <fahrvergnugen>	In C, I'd make a greasources.xml file to put gtk/menus-appmenu.ui and gtk/menus-traditional.ui to choose the menus intelligently depending on whether we're in GNOME 3 or some other GUI.  How do you do the same in a dynamic-language binding like PyGObject?
Aug 07 15:28:09 <fahrvergnugen>	hmm; looks like you can compile to a gresource file instead of a .c and .h file ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30308748/what-is-a-resource-path-that-have-to-be-used-with-gtk-builder-new-from-resource )
Aug 07 15:29:06 <fahrvergnugen>	It would be even better if you could just have it as a constant string in your program; any way to do that, but still have it intelligently choose which one based on desktop environment?

Aug 07 17:05:20 <Creak>	*its
Aug 07 17:08:00 <kung>	Creak, does the label or box expand? Maybe set padding to 0
Aug 07 17:09:39 <Creak>	kung: the box expand for sure, I suppose it's because of the content of the label. I'll try to make a small test to understand the problem
Aug 07 17:10:22 <kung>	What often helps is to to rebuild the layout in Glade and play with the options
Aug 07 17:11:18 <Creak>	yeah, I'm forking an existing project that didn't use Glade to do the layout (I plan to do that in a later improvement ;))

Aug 08 05:22:59 <rudrab>	Hi, I am trying to update the HeaderBar when a file is opened,  with the filename, as https://paste.gnome.org/p55uziash
Aug 08 05:24:02 <rudrab>	But it seems, I cant access the headerbar from the calling function, though it is defined global. Is it possible to update the headerbar dynamically?
Aug 08 05:39:45 <TingPing>	rudrab, sure you could, i think even window.set_title() still works
Aug 08 05:41:27 <TingPing>	rudrab, using globals is a poor way to pass around information though, i think it is just a question of a cleaner design. your MenuManager class sounds like an oddity
Aug 08 05:43:50 <rudrab>	TingPing: I guess, that is the problem. my Window class imports MenuManager. So, I can't find a way to get the window/headerbar variable from Window to MenuManager
Aug 08 05:45:01 <TingPing>	rudrab, the 'modern' way to do menus is with GAction and GMenu, so i think you should probably look into that for a cleaner design
Aug 08 05:46:00 <rudrab>	TingPing: thats true, and I have done this way. The MenuManager is actually the filechooserdialogs
Aug 08 05:46:39 <TingPing>	is your project hosted anywhere so i could have useful context?
Aug 08 05:47:24 <rudrab>	a older version is in github, but i can commit it now
Aug 08 05:47:35 <rudrab>	just give me few second
Aug 08 05:49:13 <rudrab>	TingPing: https://github.com/rudrab/mkbib
Aug 08 05:51:30 <TingPing>	very weird design
Aug 08 05:53:42 <rudrab>	TingPing: Thats might be true. I am from fortran background, and possibly that reflects in my python, too
Aug 08 05:54:43 <TingPing>	rudrab, the actions apply to the window.. so the actions should be within the context of the window
Aug 08 05:55:05 <TingPing>	rudrab, MenuManager 1) has nothing to do with menus, 2) is a subclass of Gtk.Window.. for no reason
Aug 08 05:55:17 <TingPing>	it just moves window logic to another file to complicate things
Aug 08 05:55:33 <TingPing>	rudrab, also in general i think Gtk lends itself better to inheritance than composition
Aug 08 05:56:38 <TingPing>	rudrab, also random note gi.require_version() has to be called before importing.. otherwise its meaningless
Aug 08 05:57:16 <rudrab>	TingPing: so, you think, contents of  MenuManager should be inside Window class?
Aug 08 05:57:38 <TingPing>	its a window action, yes it should be within the window class
Aug 08 05:58:16 <rudrab>	ah..ok. I guess, that will solve a lots of problems
Aug 08 06:00:04 <TingPing>	rudrab, also blocking IO on the main thread is no good, check out Gio for async reading files and whatnot
Aug 08 06:01:52 <rudrab>	blocking IO on the main? you mean the Gtk.events_pending?
Aug 08 06:02:48 <TingPing>	with open(...): read()
Aug 08 06:02:59 <TingPing>	that blocks the UI thread freezing the application
Aug 08 06:05:23 <TingPing>	rudrab, also if you are fiddling with events_pending() you are probably doing something wrong in the first place
Aug 08 06:06:08 <TingPing>	ah yea http
Aug 08 06:06:28 <TingPing>	you can either use libsoup for http which integrates with the mainloop, or do threading yourself
Aug 08 06:08:15 <TingPing>	rudrab, here is an example of libsoup, https://github.com/TingPing/transmission-remote-gnome/blob/master/trg/client.py

Aug 08 06:18:10 <rudrab>	TingPing: so I don't need urllib at all. 
Aug 08 06:18:32 <TingPing>	libsoup would replace urllib, yes
Aug 08 06:19:03 <TingPing>	rudrab, did you get my example link?
Aug 08 06:19:09 <rudrab>	yes
Aug 08 08:16:31 <mclasen>	ebassi: around ?
Aug 08 08:17:57 <ebassi>	mclasen: Yes
Aug 08 08:18:10 <ebassi>	Got your emails
Aug 08 08:18:25 <mclasen>	would love ot hear your opinion on transforms
Aug 08 08:19:22 <ebassi>	I thought about it, this morning, and I think adding non-drawing nodes to deal with clip != allocation cases makes the most sense to me
Aug 08 08:20:20 <mclasen>	I get some 'texture doesn't exist' warning currently for non-drawing nodes
Aug 08 08:20:25 <ebassi>	Non-drawing nodes will be skipped when rendering, and each node has its own world coordinates matrix
Aug 08 08:20:32 <ebassi>	Mmh, that's a bug :-)
Aug 08 08:21:25 <mclasen>	in general, the conversions are surprisingly easy
Aug 08 08:22:50 <ebassi>	As for fallbacks, yes: dropping into a CairoRenderer should be a quick stop gap solution
Aug 08 08:23:05 <mclasen>	needs some new gsk api
Aug 08 08:23:34 <ebassi>	gsk_renderer_get_fallback() :-)
Aug 08 08:23:56 <mclasen>	also need a render() api that takes a cairo_t instead of a GdkDrawingContext
Aug 08 08:24:07 <mclasen>	or a way to create 'freestanding' drawing contexts
Aug 08 08:25:50 <mclasen>	the big outstanding conversions are scrolled window, notebook and stack - after those, most of gtk3-demo should turn into render nodes
Aug 08 08:26:54 <ebassi>	mclasen: Sounds good
Aug 08 08:27:13 <ebassi>	Then we can start porting leaf widgets like TextView and TreeView
Aug 08 08:27:38 <mclasen>	do you have a plan to fix the 'excessive invalidation' problem in widget-factory ?
Aug 08 08:27:53 <mclasen>	I couldn't really find a way to cache any textures or nodes across frames
Aug 08 08:28:57 <ebassi>	mclasen: Yeah, nodes should not be cached; ideally, like alex said on the mailing list, we should have a "surface cache" between GTK and GSK to keep rasterizations around between frames, and invalidate them only when the widget changes
Aug 08 08:29:10 <alex>	not only surfaces
Aug 08 08:29:16 <alex>	any buffers
Aug 08 08:29:28 <alex>	i.e. vertex buffers or whatever
Aug 08 08:30:03 <ebassi>	alex: Texture ids are cached across frames, if they have the same size; just the content is different
Aug 08 08:30:22 <ebassi>	I can also easily cache the VAOs if the quads are the same
Aug 08 08:30:28 <alex>	good
Aug 08 08:30:38 <ebassi>	The main issue is invalidations need to come from GTK
Aug 08 08:30:41 <alex>	yeah
Aug 08 08:30:52 <alex>	need new invalidation model for gtk
Aug 08 08:30:57 <alex>	(like in my mail)
Aug 08 08:31:15 <alex>	sorry for not replying to you btw
Aug 08 08:31:16 <mclasen>	ebassi: there's a bunch more conversions in my gsk-renderer branch, btw
Aug 08 08:31:19 <alex>	been offline mostly
Aug 08 08:31:25 <ebassi>	alex: No worries
Aug 08 08:31:46 <alex>	i'm hoping to be wowed at guadec though
Aug 08 08:31:47 <alex>	NO PRESSURE!
Aug 08 08:32:05 <ebassi>	heh
Aug 08 08:32:32 *	ebassi still has to write his talk, as usual
Aug 08 08:32:39 <alex>	do you do anything of css using custom shaders atm, or is it all texuturing from cairo drawn stuff?
Aug 08 08:33:06 <ebassi>	Nope, texturing; though there is the beginning of a CSS blend mode shader
Aug 08 08:33:24 <ebassi>	Untangling Cairo from GTK is going to take another cycle
Aug 08 08:33:47 <ebassi>	Too much stuff passes around a cairo_t, including the public API
Aug 08 08:34:12 <ebassi>	Gadgets already create different nodes for different bits — like border, background, and focus
Aug 08 08:36:17 *	mclasen was thinking of creating one node per css background
Aug 08 08:38:35 <alex>	ebassi: But will we not be creating assloads of textures?
Aug 08 08:39:10 <alex>	i.e. full size of widget surface/texture for everything that has a border
Aug 08 08:39:21 <alex>	or background
Aug 08 08:40:30 *	mclasen opens a color chooser and counts 124 textures
Aug 08 08:40:39 <alex>	at what sizes?
Aug 08 08:41:07 <mclasen>	most of them are for the individual color swatches, I think
Aug 08 08:41:19 <alex>	I mean, a 100x100 widget with a 1px black background and solid white bg, is that 2 100x100 textures?
Aug 08 08:41:51 <ebassi>	Currently, yes
Aug 08 08:41:58 <alex>	not ideal...
Aug 08 08:42:03 <ebassi>	We'd need a 9-slice texture node
Aug 08 08:42:10 <ebassi>	Or a border-specific node
Aug 08 08:42:26 <alex>	or 4 surfaces for the border
Aug 08 08:42:37 <alex>	+ wrapping 1x1 texture for solid bgs
Aug 08 08:42:48 <alex>	eh, repeating i mean
Aug 08 08:43:42 <ebassi>	To be fair, we don't have many solid colors
Aug 08 08:44:20 <ebassi>	Even borders have gradients :-/
Aug 08 08:44:52 <alex>	ebassi: Every toplevel has a solid bg, plus viewports
Aug 08 08:45:00 <alex>	ebassi: not a *lot* but often large
Aug 08 08:45:20 <mclasen>	do we plan on using gl for gradients ?
Aug 08 08:45:31 <mclasen>	as opposed to textures
Aug 08 08:45:45 <ebassi>	mclasen: AFAIR, Cairo has some code there, but it's pretty nasty
Aug 08 08:46:24 <ebassi>	For large textures I was thinking of adopting Cogl's sliced textures, but those make things like mipmapping much harder to achieve
Aug 08 08:46:25 *	mclasen would envision just sampling at a few points and letting gl do the interpolation as it sees fit
Aug 08 08:47:11 <ebassi>	mclasen: Should work mostly fine for small linear gradients, but it gets hairy for large/radial ones
Aug 08 08:47:28 <alex>	I think having a general textured fallback for things is fine
Aug 08 08:47:32 <mclasen>	right, radial won't work easily that way
Aug 08 08:48:08 <alex>	but for super common cases, like white bg for a textview bg, or the grey window bg, or a simple square black border 1/2px, we should do better
Aug 08 08:48:48 <ebassi>	alex: We could have a GskRenderNode.set_solid_color()
Aug 08 08:48:58 <alex>	yeah
Aug 08 08:49:02 <ebassi>	That would create a 1x1 texture with a repeat
Aug 08 08:49:15 <alex>	simple hack that probably helps bandwidth a lot
Aug 08 08:49:32 <alex>	as well as memory use
Aug 08 08:50:59 *	ChanServ sets mode +q on #gtk+ Company
Aug 08 08:50:59 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Company
Aug 08 08:51:20 <mclasen>	another question: whats the fate of the pixelcache with indirect rendering ?
Aug 08 08:51:36 <alex>	i also described that in my mail :)
Aug 08 08:52:02 <mclasen>	ah, great
Aug 08 08:52:18 <alex>	i.e. we want the system to do something similar but at the buffer level
Aug 08 08:52:23 <mclasen>	thats the 'gsk review' on -devel ?
Aug 08 08:52:35 <alex>	and track invalidation inside subwidgets
Aug 08 08:53:36 <alex>	https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2016-July/msg00002.html and follow up which i think never hit the list, but ebassis reply has most of it: https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2016-July/msg00024.html
Aug 08 09:00:41 <mclasen>	Company: any idea about this ? bug 769611
Aug 08 09:00:42 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769611 .General, normal, gtk-bugs, NEW , CSS text transitions are not smooth
Aug 08 09:02:29 <Company>	ugh
Aug 08 09:02:44 <Company>	* transitions transition everything, so I wouldn't even know what's going on there
Aug 08 09:03:06 <Company>	plus, i have no idea what happens when themes change
Aug 08 09:03:07 <mclasen>	but some of the text pretty clearly changes after the other stuff
Aug 08 09:04:09 <Company>	yeah, that probably shouldn't happen
Aug 08 09:04:27 <Company>	but from the test I have no idea why that's happening
Aug 08 09:05:01 <Company>	text is also changing color twice, which probably shouldn't happen either
Aug 08 09:05:39 <Company>	but I know stuff that looks like that can happen if opacity changes
Aug 08 09:06:34 <Company>	ie if you transition from white to transparent (which is transparent black), 50% means semi-transparent gray
Aug 08 09:07:28 <Company>	so it might in the end just be some bug about transitions in the parent widget causing transitions in the children to run (which they shouldn't but so far do)
Aug 08 09:07:51 <Company>	and the labels just being the ones where those are nested most deeply
Aug 08 09:08:28 <mclasen>	hmm
Aug 08 09:08:33 <Company>	because the label color transition runs after the button color transition runs after the box color transition runs after...
Aug 08 09:08:48 <mclasen>	shouldn
Aug 08 09:08:55 <mclasen>	t all transitions run at the same time ?
Aug 08 09:09:23 <Company>	a transition is started if a value changes
Aug 08 09:09:54 <mclasen>	and in this case some inherited value changes due to the 'parent transition' ?
Aug 08 09:10:02 <Company>	yes
Aug 08 09:10:15 <Company>	and we have color: inherit; transition: *
Aug 08 09:10:24 <mclasen>	but that would still make the child transition start as soon as the parent one gets ot changing values ?
Aug 08 09:10:33 <Company>	yes
Aug 08 09:10:38 <mclasen>	or does it continuously get restarted while the parent one runs ?
Aug 08 09:10:45 <Company>	and we'd start new ones all the time until the parent transition has finished
Aug 08 09:11:00 <mclasen>	thats...suboptimal
Aug 08 09:11:03 <mclasen>	does the spec require that ?
Aug 08 09:11:07 <Company>	no
Aug 08 09:11:28 <Company>	the specs require you to not start transitions if the change was caused by a transition
Aug 08 09:12:00 <Company>	but for that you need a framework that tracks why some value changed
Aug 08 09:12:27 <Company>	box-shadow: currentColor 1em 1em;
Aug 08 09:12:45 <Company>	that one shoudln't start transitions if the parent runs a transition for font-size or color
Aug 08 09:13:17 <Company>	so tracking that properly is hard
Aug 08 09:13:37 <Company>	and it's not been necessary because themes don't nest transitions
Aug 08 09:14:21 <Company>	ie we transition the button color, but not the color of it's label or the color of the box containing it
Aug 08 09:14:25 <Company>	so it works out in the end
Aug 08 09:14:47 <Company>	as long as you don't demo things in the inspector ;)
Aug 08 09:14:55 <mclasen>	I see
Aug 08 09:15:19 <Company>	it might of course be something else
Aug 08 09:15:54 <Company>	but we're not doing anything specific to fonts that I can think of in the CSS machinery
Aug 08 09:22:14 <iulianradu>	What are the steps to follow if I want to add some .svg files to an application?
Aug 08 09:22:43 <iulianradu>	I need to add them as gresources then use gtk_icon_theme_add_resource_path ()?
Aug 08 09:40:03 <bugbot>	New glib bug 769629 filed by msanchez@gnome.org.
Aug 08 09:40:03 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769629 general, normal, gtkdev, NEW , Re-enable libmount support by default
Aug 08 09:45:51 <Company>	iulianradu: you mean like https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/ThemedIcons ?
Aug 08 09:46:20 <mclasen>	ebassi: oh, one question I pondered: what do you envision child-transform to be useful for ? the problem with using it to go clip->allocation is that it applies equally to all child nodes (widget ones and css ones)
Aug 08 09:48:06 <ebassi>	mclasen: I added child-transform from ClutterActor; actors use it to do things like "scrollable actors". You set the child transform on the parent with the scrolling offset, and then children are all automatically transformed, instead of changing the transformations on each child
Aug 08 09:49:06 <mclasen>	does that imply that there's some parent-child clipping then ?
Aug 08 09:49:55 <ebassi>	mclasen: Ideally, yes, there should be; right now there isn't.
Aug 08 09:50:05 <ebassi>	So I guess I should remove it
Aug 08 09:50:07 <iulianradu>	Company: Thanks! It seems don't have to call add_resource_path () at all if I add them in the right directory. If I use something like gtk_image_set_from_icon_name () do I have to also add the extension to the name parameter (e.g. my-icon.svg or my-icon)? 
Aug 08 09:50:15 <ebassi>	And add a note on adding stencil-based clipping
Aug 08 09:51:17 <Company>	iulianradu: just my-icon - treat it like any other system icon
Aug 08 09:51:27 <iulianradu>	Thanks
Aug 08 09:52:48 <mclasen>	ebassi: and another question: who is reponsible for setting up a widget node's transform ? the code seems a bit confused about that, currently - the widget functions set transforms, and the propagate_render_node function overrides them
Aug 08 09:55:59 <bugbot>	New glib bug 769630 filed by damien.lespiau@gmail.com.
Aug 08 09:55:59 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769630 gio, normal, gtkdev, NEW , gfile: G_FILE_MONITOR_WATCH_MOVES was actually introduced in 2.46
Aug 08 09:58:42 <ebassi>	mclasen: Yes, that's definitely suboptimal; ideally, the widget should do that, but now that the GtkContainer is allowed to override them it's a bit of a mess.
Aug 08 09:59:18 <ebassi>	mclasen: We have to solutions: one is to add a `gsk_render_node_get_transform()` and let the container modify the transform of the widget node
Aug 08 09:59:35 <ebassi>	mclasen: The other is to add a non-drawing node with the additional translation imposed by the container
Aug 08 10:02:04 <mclasen>	imo, the main thing we need is a definition of what get_render_node returns: does the node assume it is placed at the allocation, or at the clip
Aug 08 10:05:32 <mclasen>	this is somewhat related to clipping too: if we place the widget node at the allocation, we need to be able to add a larger node for the widget clip, without having the parent node clip it away
Aug 08 10:07:07 <ebassi>	mclasen: I would expect the parent node to be set to the clip, and then widget node to be set to the allocation
Aug 08 10:07:25 <ebassi>	[clip [allocation [children… ] ] ]
Aug 08 10:08:18 <fahrvergnugen>	I found a bug in the GIR; the second argument to g_regex_match_full is flagged as an array rather than a string, and I can't find any way to use it from lgi (Lua binding), even if I expand the string into an array of ASCII code points.
Aug 08 10:08:23 <mclasen>	that conflicts with what you said earlier (about having a non-drawing node at the allocation)...
Aug 08 10:09:09 <mclasen>	the 'widget node' in this terminology is what get_render_node returns, and what propagate_render_node places
Aug 08 10:10:17 <ebassi>	mclasen: Mmh, right
Aug 08 10:13:14 *	mclasen has to go do some trip preparation
Aug 08 10:13:29 <ebassi>	mclasen: Will think about it some more
Aug 08 10:14:28 <mclasen>	thanks
Aug 08 10:22:29 <garnacho>	fahrvergnugen: that's not too different from other places in API where string+length is given. Given there's no hitch in other languages (afaik), I'd think first that lgi is involved
Aug 08 10:22:42 <garnacho>	other places specify "element-type: guint8" though
Aug 08 10:24:03 <feborges>	after the changes in GtkScrolledWindow (bgo#766569), how should we approach scrolled windows which are unexpectedly expanding? by setting an arbitrary max-height-request?
Aug 08 10:25:41 <feborges>	for context: the g-c-c Printers panel is expanding because of the ScrolledWindow at the left listing the printers
Aug 08 10:25:43 <nacho_>	hey guys
Aug 08 10:26:23 <feborges>	http://i.imgur.com/345Gf5f.png
Aug 08 10:26:25 <nacho_>	for the gsettings macro how about having a gsettings_ENUM_PATH?
Aug 08 10:26:59 <nacho_>	so on non recursive makefiles I can provide a proper path for the generated file

Aug 08 10:43:44 <ebassi>	nacho_: I'd like to understand the issue, though
Aug 08 10:44:16 <ebassi>	nacho_: Why is it an issue if it's in the builddir?
Aug 08 10:45:04 <nacho_>	ebassi, in a non recursive makefile if I do NAMESPACE = pipo/my-namespace I want the generated enums.xml in pipo/ but I do not want pipo to be part of the namespace
Aug 08 10:45:08 <ebassi>	jjardon: Hey; last week I asked you if you remember why you had to add build-aux/config.rpath to the EXTRA_DIST
Aug 08 10:45:31 <jjardon>	ebassi: sorry, completely missed that; I was on holidays
Aug 08 10:45:38 <ebassi>	jjardon: No worries
Aug 08 10:45:45 <jjardon>	ebassi: its added automatically by gettextize
Aug 08 10:45:58 <ebassi>	jjardon: How?
Aug 08 10:46:19 <ebassi>	jjardon: You added it to Makefile.am/EXTRA_DIST
Aug 08 10:46:28 <ebassi>	It's a generated file, it should not be added to the dist
Aug 08 10:47:09 <jjardon>	ebassi: what module is this? gettextize modify the Makefile.am when you run it
Aug 08 10:47:19 <ebassi>	jjardon: gtk+

Aug 08 10:48:37 <ebassi>	If gettextize is adding config.rpath to the EXTRA_DIST then gettextize is doing something dumb
Aug 08 10:49:00 <jjardon>	ah, yeah; that was gettextize; should we submit a bug report?
Aug 08 10:49:07 <ebassi>	Yes, please
Aug 08 10:49:56 <jjardon>	I will send it to gettext when I finish work if you don't beat me on it :)
Aug 08 10:50:55 <ebassi>	I don't even know where the gettextize bug tracker is
Aug 08 10:52:07 <jjardon>	ebassi: AFAIK is a mailing list: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gettext/
Aug 08 10:52:20 <ebassi>	Yey!

Aug 08 11:21:27 <throwaway574>	3.14.15, Windows.  I'm more curious as to whether or not there is anything in GTK itself that can ignore the DPI settings in any version/environment.  Just knowing if it is possible in any context is what I'm looking for.
Aug 08 11:25:34 <pmike>	g_data_input_stream_readline is supposed to block or return NULL if there is no more data left in the receiving buffer?

Aug 08 11:29:53 <throwaway574>	that's okay.  i've been looking and i don't think there's anything either.
Aug 08 11:30:27 <pmike>	imo, i think there might be a bug there, at least when working with sockets (DataInputStreams) but would like to consult with you guys first
Aug 08 11:35:11 <aruiz>	throwaway574, I'd be curious to see a screenshot, can you file a bug?
Aug 08 11:35:53 <aruiz>	throwaway574, in any case, 3.14 is kind of dated atm...

Aug 08 11:55:09 <pmike>	the callback will be "fired up" a few times but not for all the lines that were really received (i've wireshark on and the device sent more lines than the ones displayed)
Aug 08 11:56:19 <pmike>	if i somehow trigger another message to the device, then the callback will be invoked for the remainder of the lines (the missing ones and the new ones, some or all...)

Aug 08 12:03:17 <throwaway574>	I probably could update GTK to a newer version.  I'm using PyGObject for Windows, and I believe that's been updated to 3.18.  I also create an executable with Py2exe to run the program on non-dev machines.
Aug 08 12:04:18 <throwaway574>	If I right-click on the exe and click 'Disable display scaling on high DPI settings', it almost works.  The text is still too large, but the widgets look better, so there's a solution in there somewhere.
Aug 08 12:30:30 <pmike>	it seems to work ok on non-presistent socket connection as the callback will be called an undetermined number of times after the other end closes the connection forcing the data to be received but on persistent socket connection it will not work the same way

Aug 09 10:36:52 <jadahl>	garnacho: popovers should use the new menu positioning system. but I guess they shouldn't grab, thus won't be dismissed when clicking outside anything
Aug 09 10:37:10 <jadahl>	i.e. they'll be xdg_popups, but not part of a menu popup grab chain
Aug 09 10:42:36 <garnacho>	jadahl: I maybe should have a closer look to v6 :)
Aug 09 10:42:48 <garnacho>	baedert: looks good :)
Aug 09 10:42:59 <rudrab>	Hi, in most of the Gtk apps, e.g. epiphany, statusbar is shown as a slide, drawn over other existing widgets, and disappears after remove_all. i.e. it does not need a special place in grid
Aug 09 10:44:28 <rudrab>	is there any small example that shows this behaviour? I have tried to get it from epiphany, but thats too complex for my present understanding
Aug 09 10:46:34 <jadahl>	garnacho: i will hopefully nag you about gtk and mutter patches shortly
Aug 09 10:46:43 <jadahl>	review of that is

Aug 09 13:50:55 <rudrab>	Hi, is there any container with its own window that can pack the statusbar? (like epiphany)
Aug 09 13:54:21 <jmd>	rudrab: All containers can pack any widget.
Aug 09 13:56:09 <Hussam>	a gnome-terminal fix causes a crash. should I post a backtrace in the bug report whose fix introduced the crash or do I file a brand new report?
Aug 09 13:57:52 <rudrab>	jmd: yes...but they dont have their own window. e.g. I have tried to pack statusbar inside a Gtk.Box...but since it does not has its own window, the text remains transparent to the main window
Aug 09 13:58:23 <jmd>	The only GtkContainer with its own window, so far as I'm aware is GtkLayout.
Aug 09 13:58:59 <baedert>	rudrab: transparent?
Aug 09 13:59:03 <jmd>	But that should not have any bearing on the effect you describe.
Aug 09 13:59:24 <baedert>	Hussam: Doesn't really matter
Aug 09 13:59:38 <Hussam>	baedert: ok, I'll post in the same bug.
Aug 09 14:00:08 <rudrab>	https://paste.gnome.org/plmdvdvw5 is what i am doing
Aug 09 14:00:45 <rudrab>	since it is overlayed to another, statusbar writes over scroll
Aug 09 14:01:36 <rudrab>	so, if scroll also has text on the same coordinate, its a mess
Aug 09 14:02:00 <rudrab>	I am trying to achieve the statusbar like its sone in epiphany
Aug 09 14:02:21 <baedert>	But how do you want to fix that? Give the text a background?
Aug 09 14:02:56 <jmd>	rudrab: Typically you would pack a status bar into a GtkBox
Aug 09 14:03:22 <rudrab>	thats what I have doen
Aug 09 14:03:27 <rudrab>	isnt it?
Aug 09 14:03:36 <jmd>	I have no idea.
Aug 09 14:04:59 <rudrab>	https://paste.gnome.org/pdk3mwt3q is the code...plz have a look...6line only
Aug 09 14:06:07 <jmd>	You're using GtkOverlay.  That always complicates things.   Do you really need it?
Aug 09 14:08:07 <rudrab>	yes...actually, I don't want to waste space only for occasional status messages
Aug 09 14:08:58 <baedert>	"widget drawn without current allocation" is just the most useless warning ever :(
Aug 09 14:09:12 <rudrab>	but, actually there comes the problem. And thats why, I am looking for a container with its own window
Aug 09 14:09:39 <jmd>	You could always write one yourself.
Aug 09 14:14:11 <rudrab>	I have also tried GtkEventBox...
Aug 09 14:14:47 <baedert>	I still don't understand what you mean by container with its own window or why that would fix your issue.
Aug 09 14:15:07 <baedert>	Your problem so far is just that you have text overlayd over other text, which is unreadable?
Aug 09 14:16:39 <rudrab>	baedert: yes
Aug 09 14:17:02 <baedert>	rudrab: So you just want a background for your text?
Aug 09 14:17:44 <rudrab>	baedert: yes...i guess.
Aug 09 14:18:04 <baedert>	rudrab: you guess?
Aug 09 14:18:52 <rudrab>	I want a background to the text, sure. 
Aug 09 14:19:20 <baedert>	you get that by adding a style class to a widget and styling the class appropiately
Aug 09 14:21:29 <rudrab>	baedert: you mean css?
Aug 09 14:21:40 <baedert>	yep
Aug 09 14:21:53 <baedert>	or, well, in that case adding .background to the label might even work.

Aug 09 21:40:33 <raymod2>	I'm having trouble with HiDPI on a Windows laptop.  The change I made for OSX doesn't seem to be working on Windows 10.
Aug 09 21:40:51 <raymod2>	I used this:  scale = gtk_widget_get_scale_factor(widget);
Aug 09 21:41:42 <raymod2>	Then I multiplied my width and height by the scale factor when creating the image surface.
Aug 09 21:41:59 <raymod2>	And this: cairo_surface_set_device_scale(surface, scale, scale);
Aug 09 21:43:04 <raymod2>	So why doesn't this work on Windows 10?  My application is getting zoomed by the OS.  In other words I am rendering at 100x100 for example and it is displaying in a window that is 250x250.

Aug 09 21:47:15 <raymod2>	Oh, wow.  I thought this would have been implemented years ago.
Aug 09 21:54:33 <raymod2>	I read through the bug history.  When do you expect this work will be pulled in?
Aug 09 21:55:51 <raymod2>	Also, is HiDPI working on Linux?  Fedora and Ubuntu for example?
Aug 09 22:01:56 <raymod2>	Finally, is it possible to work around this missing support in the near term?  Can my application report to Windows that it is HiDPI capable to prevent the OS from scaling it, then check the screen resolution to see if it is HiDPI, and finally apply a manual scale factor to everything in GTK+?
Aug 09 22:04:06 <LRN>	HiDPI works on X11
Aug 09 22:04:23 <LRN>	no idea about workarounds or when this is going to be merged in
Aug 09 22:04:35 <LRN>	so far only fanc works on this

Aug 10 08:22:47 <rudrab>	Hi, yesterday, I was talking about statusbar, which is yet to solve

Aug 10 08:30:55 <rudrab>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38866053/epiphany-chrome-like-statusbar-with-its-own-background
Aug 10 08:31:10 <rudrab>	may I request you a kindl look?
Aug 10 08:33:59 <TingPing>	rudrab, basically want this - https://github.com/GNOME/nautilus/blob/master/src/nautilus-floating-bar.c
Aug 10 08:35:58 <TingPing>	rudrab, here is the css - https://github.com/GNOME/nautilus/blob/master/src/resources/css/Adwaita.css#L64-L90
Aug 10 08:36:17 <TingPing>	rudrab, really it should be as simple as just apply that css to the box
Aug 10 08:38:06 <TingPing>	i swore i had a python example using that but i can't find it
Aug 10 08:39:00 <rudrab>	TingPing: thanks. I will try it. But, what I am thinking of is how the box will disappear with the statusbar message. May be I need to create it every time, and destroy. But I will check
Aug 10 08:39:15 <TingPing>	rudrab, just call hide()
Aug 10 08:39:39 <rudrab>	ah..ok
Aug 10 08:40:10 <csoriano___>	rudrab: that code has that handling too
Aug 10 08:40:44 <baedert>	garnacho: Um yes, is the important part here the modality or the input shape?
Aug 10 08:47:21 <nicknameitis>	i asked this yesterday and no answer. i'm trying to figure out how gtk-inspector gets the widget name as it is specified in glade. i looked at its sources, but failed to find it
Aug 10 08:47:43 <baedert>	nicknameitis: With the name you mean the name or the id?
Aug 10 08:50:00 <nicknameitis>	baedert: had to reopen glade, darn thing just crashed on me for the first time in 2 weeks. in glade it is ID
Aug 10 08:50:47 <baedert>	gtk_buildable_get_name?
Aug 10 08:51:11 <nicknameitis>	thanks, i'll try asap
Aug 10 08:51:33 <baedert>	object-tree.c:1089 fwiw
Aug 10 08:59:37 <garnacho>	baedert: both, removing modality makes the rest of the app responsive asap, the empty input shape prevents you from clicking again on the popover before it disappears
Aug 10 09:08:22 <nicknameitis>	baedert: thanks a ton, that works
Aug 10 09:08:54 <andlabs>	someone here should probably respond to this because I'm at a loss http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38871450/how-can-i-get-the-default-colors-in-gtk
Aug 10 09:12:35 <baedert>	Why? For a sufficiently complex widget, you'll have to style it yourself (or the theme has to), and that's it.
Aug 10 09:15:04 <nicknameitis>	andlabs: i asked this question quite a while ago and answers i got were: "you can't since move on css, at best you can do is draw it" and from more useful to me from lapoc "you can use @theme_selected_bg_color"
Aug 10 09:15:38 <nicknameitis>	i needed color of selected item when i asked this
Aug 10 09:16:05 <rudrab>	may be I am doing something very stupid, but statusbar.connect("text-pushed") is not working
Aug 10 09:17:27 <rudrab>	https://paste.gnome.org/pjd1pabiw
Aug 10 09:19:01 <andlabs>	nicknameitis: yeah, I'm at a loss of how to explain this in a convincing way
Aug 10 09:19:20 <andlabs>	I think the model that GTK+ devs want you to follow is use composite widgets unless absolutely necesary
Aug 10 09:19:24 <andlabs>	but
Aug 10 09:19:40 <visarion>	glib related, I try to open a file two times using g_open (path, O_RDWR)
Aug 10 09:20:16 <nicknameitis>	andlabs: truth is that with css really is nothing like color as you might specify gradient between two colors or bitmap for value
Aug 10 09:20:20 <visarion>	The second time I get -1 as a result. Isn't g_open suppose to behave like POSIX open and provide two fd to the same file ?
Aug 10 09:20:58 <TingPing>	visarion, on unix it literally is calling open()
Aug 10 09:21:16 <visarion>	Oh, ok
Aug 10 09:21:18 <visarion>	:)
Aug 10 09:22:24 <andlabs>	what OS
Aug 10 09:22:37 <andlabs>	and what's the full call
Aug 10 09:25:50 <baedert>	garnacho: https://paste.xinu.at/RivxH/
Aug 10 09:26:04 <baedert>	garnacho: Any ideas about naming? Pop*over*, pop*down* and pop*up*? :)
Aug 10 09:32:02 <garnacho>	baedert: not offhead... at least this one is consistent with GtkComboBox/Menu
Aug 10 09:32:08 <garnacho>	baedert: looks good IMO :)
Aug 10 09:37:17 <garnacho>	andlabs: the rationale is more or less that there's no "default colors", background might be a gradient/image, colors are animatable... you ideally just gtk_render_*() stuff and trust css, or get colors from the GtkStyleContext in a rather limited way
Aug 10 09:38:16 <garnacho>	andlabs: themes obviously want a base palette, but they can name those colors however they want, certainly not limited to background/foreground
Aug 10 09:48:03 <baedert>	garnacho: The other problem is that if the popover uses a subsurface, that still causes the toplevel to be drawn without an allocation (if the popover resizes)
Aug 10 09:48:48 <andlabs>	ah yes I forgot gtk_render_layout()
Aug 10 09:48:59 <andlabs>	even though I literally just used it the last time I wrote GTK+ a month or so ago
Aug 10 09:49:33 <andlabs>	but it's more that last comment there that irks me and that makes me unsure how to properly answer the question
Aug 10 09:49:34 <andlabs>	"Moreover, how would you react if you crashed a program just because you dared removing a single label somewhere? How would you react if changing the color of a label actually changed the color of other, completely unrelated, widgets? "
Aug 10 09:50:08 <andlabs>	like don't we *want* text to be the same color regardless of what widget it is?

Aug 10 09:50:51 <baedert>	I don't want my .destructive-action buttons to have the same color as normal buttons

Aug 10 09:51:31 <baedert>	freudian caps
Aug 10 09:51:54 <Company>	no, i have an app where i use caps to look at a dashboard temporarily
Aug 10 09:52:52 <Company>	andlabs: the correct answer to that question is "there are no colors apart from the foreground color for your widget that you can query via gtk_style_context_get_color()
Aug 10 09:53:16 <Company>	andlabs: everything else is done via gtk_render_*() functions
Aug 10 09:53:44 <Company>	and whether those things use colors or not is none of your business
Aug 10 09:54:07 <Company>	(not colors = they use images most likely)
Aug 10 09:58:24 <andlabs>	yeah
Aug 10 09:58:26 <andlabs>	I figured
Aug 10 09:58:40 <andlabs>	and right, I know widgets that are supposed to stand out should have different colors
Aug 10 09:58:42 <andlabs>	I mean in general
Aug 10 09:58:55 <andlabs>	it'd be jarring if every button had rainbow text
Aug 10 09:59:08 <garnacho>	baedert: hmm, I think that'd hint a bug somewhere else...
Aug 10 09:59:29 <baedert>	garnacho: Yeah, but it was the bug I was initially trying to fix :)
Aug 10 09:59:48 <baedert>	garnacho: i.e. even if you apply that patch, you'll still get those warnings on wayland

Aug 10 10:25:23 <sumustinis>	Hi there, I have a treeview and signal button-release-event connected to it. I pass coordinates to get_path_at_pos to get path and column. But if click in celleditable within treeview I can not know anymore is it coordinates of celleditable area or treeview area any suggestions?
Aug 10 10:47:35 <sumustinis>	Ok found a solution myself ... have to connect same signal to editable with connect_after and return true so it does not propagate to a treeview ...

Aug 10 13:40:33 <kalkin->	baedert: thanks 
Aug 10 13:52:14 <kalkin->	Actually I don't want to have it left. I want to have it right next to the network/profile/shutdown menu
Aug 10 13:52:36 <baedert>	Then you have to write a shell extension
Aug 10 13:53:17 <kalkin->	But a shell extension only works if I'm using Gnome DE. The app should also work in KDE & XFCE. 
Aug 10 13:54:02 <baedert>	But neither of those have a bar at the top you could put your menu in.
Aug 10 13:54:27 <kalkin->	baedert: Currently I use AppIndicator3 for that

Aug 12 03:56:23 <rudrab>	https://paste.gnome.org/ps9enne9r is what I am trying
Aug 12 04:12:35 <rudrab>	anyone please?
Aug 12 04:15:09 <LRN>	"close a method"?
Aug 12 04:15:16 <LRN>	must be something pythonic
Aug 12 04:15:49 <rudrab>	LRN yes. actually I want to kill the function itself when the window is closed
Aug 12 04:16:05 <LRN>	how do you normally kill a function?
Aug 12 04:16:35 <rudrab>	with a `return`
Aug 12 04:17:15 <LRN>	are threads involved?
Aug 12 04:17:21 <rudrab>	no
Aug 12 04:17:58 <LRN>	then i do not quite understand the control flow in your hypothetical program
Aug 12 04:18:33 <LRN>	gtk is, by itself, single-threaded and event-based, with a main loop running the app
Aug 12 04:19:49 <LRN>	what does the function (the one you want to kill) do?
Aug 12 04:20:29 <rudrab>	will it be helpful if I paste the complete function?
Aug 12 04:20:44 <LRN>	you can just explain in your own words
Aug 12 04:21:28 <rudrab>	it creates a a window and a treeview, and populate the treeview through a loop
Aug 12 04:22:04 <LRN>	and then?
Aug 12 04:22:33 <rudrab>	say, if I close the window, before the loop (and any other job) finished, I want the loop and the rest of the code to exit
Aug 12 04:23:03 <LRN>	how long does it take for the loop to populate the treeview?
Aug 12 04:24:08 <rudrab>	~20sec
Aug 12 04:24:51 <LRN>	is the window with the treeview the only window you have?
Aug 12 04:25:34 <rudrab>	no...its a side job. If its the main window I could have done Gtk.main_quit()
Aug 12 04:25:42 <LRN>	i see
Aug 12 04:26:00 <LRN>	do you understand the concept of a main loop and event processing in GUI applications?
Aug 12 04:27:59 <rudrab>	I have read that, but..
Aug 12 04:28:08 <LRN>	but what?
Aug 12 04:29:43 <rudrab>	i mean not sure abt ubderstanding
Aug 12 04:31:02 <LRN>	a GUI application (a GTK+-based GUI application, at least) works by running a main loop. Main loop does 3 things: 1) waits for something to happen, 2) turns that "something" into an event, 3) passes the event to the application
Aug 12 04:32:02 <LRN>	GTK+ handles many events internally, but some of them are turned into signals that *your* code can handle (such as button being pressed or a window being closed)
Aug 12 04:32:56 <LRN>	GTK+ is single-threaded internally. When an event is passed from the main loop to GTK+, the main loop stops fetching new events and waits for GTK+ to handle the event it already has
Aug 12 04:33:29 <LRN>	If that event causes a signal in your code to be sent, then while your signal handler is working, the main loop is still stopped
Aug 12 04:34:20 <LRN>	that is why any GUI code you have must work quickly. It absolutely cannot take 20 seconds to complete, because your application will freeze for these 20 seconds
Aug 12 04:34:57 <LRN>	there are three ways to get around that.
Aug 12 04:35:31 <LRN>	One is to split the work you need to do into small chunks and do it one chunk at a time
Aug 12 04:36:45 <LRN>	when a chunk is done, you queue a continuation (something like g_idle_add() or somesuch), telling the toolkit to go back to its thing and call your worker function again once it doesn't have anything better to do, so that you can do the next chunk
Aug 12 04:37:06 <LRN>	The second way is to do your work in a thread.
Aug 12 04:37:44 <LRN>	However, there are subtle difficulties in invoking GTK+ functions from another thread and passing data from your worker thread to GTK+ main thread
Aug 12 04:38:06 <LRN>	There are guides and code examples for doing this somewhere
Aug 12 04:39:12 <LRN>	The third way is to use asynchronous APIs to do your work. If such APIs exist. For example, most filesystem-related functions have asynchronous variants.
Aug 12 04:39:48 <LRN>	this is the same as using threads, but the OS (usually it's the OS) will hide the ugly details from you
Aug 12 04:40:21 <LRN>	obviously, complex mathematical functions or anything you write on your own will not be asynchronous
Aug 12 04:41:13 <LRN>	The fourth way is...um...i forgot what it is
Aug 12 04:41:22 *	LRN tries to remember
Aug 12 04:42:16 <LRN>	damn
Aug 12 04:42:33 <LRN>	anyway, back to your application
Aug 12 04:43:03 <LRN>	if you need examples, GTK has something similar - filechooser dialog search functionality
Aug 12 04:43:25 <LRN>	it has a treeview that is, over time, populated by the results of filesystem search (which is, by definition, a slow-ish process)
Aug 12 04:44:56 <The_gull>	baedert: not that I know
Aug 12 04:45:59 <LRN>	ah, i remembered the fourth way. The fourth way is to just do your work in a loop and have it regularly explicitly nudge the main loop
Aug 12 04:47:14 <LRN>	i think the function is g_main_context_iteration ()
Aug 12 04:47:30 <LRN>	i wouldn't recommend that though
Aug 12 04:50:36 <LRN>	anyway, your "kill the function" functionality will be done differently, depending on how you do your work
Aug 12 04:50:48 <LRN>	if it's a thread, you can cancel it like any other thread
Aug 12 04:51:26 <LRN>	if it's async API, you can cancel it like any other async API (glib async APIs are usually cancellable)
Aug 12 04:52:47 <LRN>	if it's split into chunks, you don't queue the next chunk
Aug 12 04:53:26 <LRN>	if you're manually cranking the main loop, you just check whether you should stop, and don't go on if you should
Aug 12 04:56:01 <LRN>	caveat emptor: in Python threads do not run in parallel, so the threaded way won't work for you
Aug 12 04:59:46 <rudrab>	LRN:thanks...looking for async threads
Aug 12 05:04:00 <rudrab>	*async & threads

Aug 12 08:46:21 <The_gull>	is there a way to know at what position a popover is drawn ? (not what its favorite position is)
Aug 12 08:48:05 <The_gull>	or : I’m trying to attach a popover to a row at the left-right position where the mouse has right-click, but I want it to be attach at the top of the row when the popover will be drawn on top, and at the bottom of the row when the popover will be drawn on bottom ; how should I do ?
Aug 12 10:31:26 <tomtix>	i'm currently trying to make a popover searchbar that pop under the mouse when you press space (like in blender ui, or in glade ui when you double click on central pane); currently i just show the popover when the key-press-event is emitted on the window (top level) object but when the popover fades I get this error: (osux_editor:3431): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: gsignal.c:2635: instance '0x1fae350' has no handler with id '1101' (the adr

Aug 12 10:32:42 <tomtix>	the popover is currently relative to some button in the window, and this error does not happen when it is shown by the clicked event on this button

Aug 12 11:38:45 <baedert>	tomtix: what gtk version?
Aug 12 11:39:46 <tomtix>	gtk3
Aug 12 11:40:27 <baedert>	tomtix: what gtk3 version?
Aug 12 11:40:37 <tomtix>	the precise version is 3.20.8-1
Aug 12 11:41:22 <tomtix>	from the archlinux package
Aug 12 11:53:47 <jmd>	How does one "register" a GApplication ?
Aug 12 11:56:03 <TingPing>	just a guess, g_application_register()
Aug 12 11:56:36 <TingPing>	i think that all normally happens under the hood
Aug 12 12:26:10 <pgrunt>	hi, what is proper way to get HWND from GdkWindow? gdk_win32_window_get_impl_hwnd / GDK_WINDOW_HWND ?
Aug 12 12:26:52 <pgrunt>	spice-gtk uses GDK_WINDOW_HWND but has rendering issues with CSD enabled
Aug 12 12:39:07 <LRN>	anyone interested in having colored structured logging output on Windows?
Aug 12 12:39:50 <LRN>	pgrunt, why do you need HWND?
Aug 12 12:40:13 <LRN>	also, which version of GTK+ does spice-gtk use?
Aug 12 12:40:28 <pgrunt>	the problems started with 3.20
Aug 12 12:41:21 <pgrunt>	LRN: we need it in some winapi https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-gtk/tree/src/spice-widget.c#n715
Aug 12 12:44:22 <LRN>	gdk_win32_window_get_impl_hwnd() internally just calls GDK_WINDOW_HWND() after checking that the window is indeed a WIN32 one
Aug 12 12:44:35 <pgrunt>	LRN: it is different GDK_WINDOW_HWND
Aug 12 12:45:00 <pgrunt>	see gdkwin32misc.h
Aug 12 12:45:00 <LRN>	ah, yes, the internal one
Aug 12 12:45:34 <LRN>	anyway, it should work
Aug 12 12:45:50 <LRN>	why would spice-gtk have rendering issues if it doesn't render anything using that HWND?
Aug 12 12:45:57 <pgrunt>	yeah, my concern is that both are not very documented
Aug 12 12:46:04 <pgrunt>	LRN: it is because gdk_window_ensure_native
Aug 12 12:46:57 <LRN>	gdk_win32_window_get_handle() seems pretty reasonable
Aug 12 12:47:23 <LRN>	or not
Aug 12 12:47:45 <LRN>	yeah, definitely not
Aug 12 12:48:04 <LRN>	does it work better with gdk_win32_window_get_impl_hwnd()?
Aug 12 12:48:22 <pgrunt>	yes, it seems to work
Aug 12 12:48:39 <pgrunt>	we had the same issues with linux implementation
Aug 12 12:49:07 <pgrunt>	no rendering, because gdk_window_ensure_native steals the window, or something like that
Aug 12 12:49:13 <LRN>	creating new impl for each GdkWindow is definitely not a good idea, so do use gdk_win32_window_get_impl_hwnd()
Aug 12 12:49:52 <pgrunt>	LRN: thanks!
Aug 12 12:50:03 <LRN>	that's what gdk_window_ensure_native() does - it creates an impl for the window, unless it already has one tied to itself
Aug 12 12:50:34 <LRN>	normally only the toplevel has its own impl, all its children just use the one they get from their toplevel
Aug 12 12:51:20 <LRN>	you can probably work around this in user code by first doing gdk_window_get_toplevel() on the window, then getting its HWND
Aug 12 12:51:45 <LRN>	gdk_win32_window_get_impl_hwnd() is probably better though
Aug 12 12:53:09 <pgrunt>	and for me it is just s/GDK_WINDOW_HWND/gdk_win32_window_get_impl_hwnd/g ;)
Aug 12 12:54:57 <pgrunt>	LRN: thanks for explanation 
Aug 12 12:55:28 <LRN>	NP-complete
Aug 12 13:00:24 <pgrunt>	fidencio: the key part is: "creating new impl for each GdkWindow is definitely not a good idea, so do use gdk_win32_window_get_impl_hwnd()"
Aug 12 14:33:16 <norbert>	hey folks, which function will I use to get the text_length of a gtk_editable?
Aug 12 14:33:27 <norbert>	gtk_entry used to have gtk_entry_get_text_length()
Aug 12 14:33:58 <TingPing>	norbert, still does
Aug 12 14:34:04 <norbert>	I can do a conversion "gtk_entry_get_text_length (GTK_ENTRY (...))" but I'm not sure if that's the best solution
Aug 12 14:34:09 <norbert>	ok
Aug 12 14:34:38 <TingPing>	norbert, if you have an editable that IS an entry, it is safe to cast up yes
Aug 12 14:36:02 <norbert>	actually, now that I'm here, I have another question
Aug 12 14:36:46 <norbert>	when I change a gtk_table_attach to a gtk_grid_attach, the last 4 parameters disappear, including the padding; how can I bring back the padding?
Aug 12 14:38:53 <norbert>	I guess maybe the _spacing() functions? although from what I'm reading they don't function on a per-'cell' basis
Aug 12 14:39:09 <norbert>	they probably go for all columns or all rows
Aug 12 14:39:19 <TingPing>	norbert, the widgets margin property?
Aug 12 14:40:02 <norbert>	I don't know, how would I use the widget's margin property? can it have a different distance left/right versus top/bottom?
Aug 12 14:40:25 <TingPing>	yes, margin-top, margin-left, etc
Aug 12 14:40:29 <norbert>	oh, never mind the last question, I see margin-bottom, etc.
Aug 12 14:41:26 <norbert>	gtk_widget_set_margin_left() seems to be one of the functions I can use
Aug 12 14:41:33 <norbert>	alrighty, thanks
Aug 12 14:51:48 <norbert>	warning: implicit declaration of function ‘gtk_widget_set_margin’
Aug 12 14:52:07 <norbert>	is a bit weird though, you'd think if everything is, for example, 2, you could just use one function
Aug 12 14:52:44 <norbert>	similar to what css can do with margin in addition to margin-top etc.
Aug 12 14:53:11 <norbert>	I can of course put together my own function for this - probably will
Aug 12 14:53:39 <ernestask>	you could just set the “margin” property
Aug 12 14:54:01 <norbert>	ernestask, how can I do that?
Aug 12 14:54:03 <TingPing>	norbert, i mean, you could probably use css for this too
Aug 12 14:54:44 <norbert>	ernestask, I haven't touched GTK+ in 16 years :)
Aug 12 14:54:52 <norbert>	17, actually
Aug 12 14:55:45 <ernestask>	norbert, you could look into using CSS, as TingPing suggested, or use g_object_set (widget, "margin", margin, NULL)
Aug 12 14:56:47 <norbert>	thanks
Aug 12 14:59:34 <norbert>	the GTK+ documentation is pretty good, better than the SDL documentation; one thing that's a bit unfortunate is that occasionally it just says "... has been deprecated since version ... and should not be used in newly-written code" without mentioning alternatives
Aug 12 15:00:01 <baedert>	there are not always replacements
Aug 12 15:00:34 <norbert>	true, but I've been able to find them several times when they weren't mentioned
Aug 12 15:54:25 <norbert>	should I always be able to use "$ GTK_DEBUG=interactive ./application" and then Ctrl+Shift+i on any window to bring up something?
Aug 12 15:54:41 <grawity>	for apps which do not use dbus-activation
Aug 12 15:54:42 <norbert>	I'm trying to find out why there's space around images
Aug 12 15:55:13 <norbert>	I don't think I'm using dbus-activation, because I don't know what that is :)
Aug 12 15:55:18 <norbert>	but the debug window is not showing up
Aug 12 15:55:39 <norbert>	I'm on Linux, if that makes any difference
Aug 12 15:55:54 <grawity>	normally GTK_DEBUG=interactive makes the inspector visible by default
Aug 12 15:56:30 <TingPing>	norbert, also i presume you have gtk >= 3.14
Aug 12 15:56:53 <norbert>	I'm not sure how to check
Aug 12 15:56:59 <TingPing>	what distro
Aug 12 15:57:02 <norbert>	I tried "pkg-config gtk+-3.0 --version" but it says 0.26 for, I'm guessing, pkg-config
Aug 12 15:57:04 <norbert>	Mint
Aug 12 15:57:57 <norbert>	apt just says "libgtk-3-dev - development files for the GTK+ library" although.. lemme look up the apt command to see more info
Aug 12 15:58:08 <slaf>	pkg-config --modversion gtk+-3.0
Aug 12 15:58:11 <TingPing>	norbert, mint 17 is ancient with 3.10
Aug 12 15:58:20 <TingPing>	mint 18 is recent enough
Aug 12 15:58:38 <norbert>	ok, I'm using Mint 17.3
Aug 12 15:58:53 <norbert>	oh, I see 18 arrived 43 days ago
Aug 12 15:58:59 <norbert>	I guess I can dist-upgrade
Aug 12 15:59:02 <norbert>	I'll do that
Aug 12 15:59:10 <TingPing>	i thought mint doesn't support dist upgrades
Aug 12 15:59:19 <norbert>	it does
Aug 12 16:05:12 <norbert>	usually the Update Manager has something like https://www.linuxmint.com/pictures/screenshots/rosa/thumb_mintupgrade1.png

Aug 12 19:24:27 <norbert>	I've upgraded to Mint 18 and GTK_DEBUG=interactive now works, the GtkImage seems to be the right size, but the GtkButton is larger than the image
Aug 12 19:25:31 <norbert>	on the button, there are about 6 pixels of gray around the image
Aug 12 19:26:12 <norbert>	the buttons also appear to be slightly rounded, but they should be as the square image
Aug 12 19:26:22 <norbert>	I really want 0 pixels around the image
Aug 12 19:26:33 <norbert>	any suggestions how I could tackle this issue?
Aug 12 19:30:30 <norbert>	the button says allocated size 42x37, clip area 42x38; the image on it is 24x24
Aug 12 19:32:15 <norbert>	very nice by the way that interactive tool
Aug 12 19:35:58 <norbert>	I do use gtk_widget_set_size_request() to pick 24
Aug 12 19:36:06 <norbert>	don't get why it's larger
Aug 12 19:40:29 <The_gull>	norbert: set CSS padding/border/margin to 0 ?
Aug 12 19:43:45 <norbert>	The_gull: I can just paste "padding:0px; border:0px; margin:0px;" in the CSS field of Objects to test?
Aug 12 19:46:26 <The_gull>	norbert: what version of GNOME / gtk+ are you using ?
Aug 12 19:46:55 <norbert>	I wish there was an easy gtk3-config --version
Aug 12 19:47:15 <norbert>	GTK+ 3.18.9
Aug 12 19:47:28 <The_gull>	in 3.20+, “headerbar button { padding:0; border:none;  margin:0; background:transparent; }” does some quite complete things
Aug 12 19:48:03 <grim>	like "pkg-config --modversion gtk+-3.0" ?
Aug 12 19:48:08 <The_gull>	in 3.18.n, it should be different (and there’s not anymore a “CSS field of Objects”, there’s just the generic CSS thing)
Aug 12 19:48:30 <The_gull>	.titlebar .button { … }, IIRC, should work
Aug 12 19:48:48 <norbert>	The_gull: yes, now it does something
Aug 12 19:50:17 <norbert>	when I use ".button { padding:0; margin:0; border:0; }" it removes a lot of space, but still not all
Aug 12 19:51:17 <The_gull>	there could be some margin around the image, also
Aug 12 19:51:18 <norbert>	but I should be able to figure things out this way, thanks
Aug 12 20:02:18 <norbert>	can status bars have newlines? \n doesn't work
Aug 12 21:58:17 <norbert>	it says gdk_cursor_new() is deprecated; I see the replacement gdk_cursor_new_for_display() but that requires a display parameter; can I just use gdk_display_open() with NULL to get/create one, and then pass that to this new function?
Aug 12 21:59:55 <The_gull>	norbert: IIRC there’s a gdk_display_get_default(), could help
Aug 12 22:00:31 <norbert>	I did see that function, but it returns a GdkDisplay
Aug 12 22:00:48 <norbert>	and gdk_display_open() needs a const gchar *display_name
Aug 12 22:01:23 <norbert>	oh, wait, you mean I can just use that one
Aug 12 22:02:54 <norbert>	yeah, thanks
Aug 12 22:02:59 <The_gull>	I think this has a chance to be the correct way to do that :·)
Aug 12 22:03:51 <norbert>	any thought on whether status bars can have newlines?
Aug 12 22:04:33 <norbert>	I'm porting a super old GTK+ application and back in the day \n worked, but it now displays a 000A block

Aug 13 04:03:55 <rudrab>	Hi, how can I set preferences for future sessions? like, say, my project will save pdf file to some place. Currently, it is hard coded to Downloads dir. Can i give user a choice to reset it? 
Aug 13 04:14:44 <jmd>	What is the likelihood of GValue getting deprecated in the foreseeable future?
Aug 13 04:28:33 <baedert>	1.3%
Aug 13 04:29:22 <baedert>	rudrab: yes? you can always just save a path your user selected?
Aug 13 04:38:17 <jmd>	How can I define my own GVariantType ?
Aug 13 06:18:11 <jmd>	Why is it that the argument to g_variant_print is non const ?
Aug 13 06:33:43 <jmd>	According to the documentation for g_variant_bytestring:
Aug 13 06:33:49 <jmd>	If the array does not end with a nul terminator character, the empty string is returned. For this reason, you can always trust that a non-NULL nul-terminated string will be returned by this function.
Aug 13 06:34:03 <jmd>	This is self-contradictory.
Aug 13 06:34:23 <jmd>	The empty string IS null terminated.
Aug 13 07:01:07 <tomtix>	this means that if the the byte array contained in the gvariant is not a well formed string, the empty string is return instead, isn't it?
Aug 13 07:02:01 <jmd>	tomtix: Yes. I think that is what it means.
Aug 13 07:02:28 <jmd>	But like I say, the text of the documentation contradicts itself.
Aug 13 07:02:49 <tomtix>	why?
Aug 13 07:03:15 <jmd>	If the first sentence is true, the the second CANNOT be true.
Aug 13 07:04:37 <tomtix>	if the gvariant hold a well formed string, this string is returned, otherwise empty (well formed) string is return; In both case a well formed string is return. And NULL is never returned. This is what is means. I don't see where the contradiction is
Aug 13 07:05:06 <jmd>	You must be reading  a different text to me.
Aug 13 07:06:38 <tomtix>	I'm reading this: https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-GVariant.html#g-variant-get-bytestring
Aug 13 07:07:11 <jmd>	Right.  It contradicts itself severly.
Aug 13 07:07:35 <tomtix>	can you explain more
Aug 13 07:07:40 <tomtix>	?
Aug 13 07:09:20 <jmd>	The empty string is null terminated.
Aug 13 07:09:30 <tomtix>	yes
Aug 13 07:09:48 <tomtix>	and?
Aug 13 07:10:15 <jmd>	I give up.
Aug 13 07:11:56 <tomtix>	the doc says this function must return only well formed (null terminated) strings, so if the byte array is not a well formed string, the empty string which is well formed and null terminated is returned instead of the byte array content.
Aug 13 07:12:19 <tomtix>	this is not a contradiction
Aug 13 07:13:24 <ork>	hey folks
Aug 13 07:14:29 <ork>	I'm subclassing Gtk.Image to display a resource image whil attempting to asynchronously loading with HTTP a remote image, and caching it
Aug 13 07:14:57 <ork>	Do you know of any existing implementation? That would be grand if I can skip that
Aug 13 07:17:30 <ork>	(I'm doing a Gtk3 Steam client http://ork.olol.eu/public/2016-08-13_13-17-00__wip-steam.png)
Aug 13 07:21:21 <TingPing>	ork, Lutris provides a launcher to steam games too
Aug 13 07:28:01 <rudrab>	baedert: sorry for awfully late response. So, basically, I need a .config file, where the user selected data will be stored and will be read from?
Aug 13 07:31:13 <TingPing>	rudrab, ideally you use GSettings
Aug 13 07:35:40 <rudrab>	TingPing: ok
Aug 13 07:46:19 <rudrab>	TingPing: do you have any idea of what contains GSettings in python? I am getting many things lke Gtk.Settings/GioSettings etc but not Gsettings
Aug 13 07:46:44 <rudrab>	https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject?
Aug 13 07:47:17 <TingPing>	rudrab, G prefix means GLib, which does have multiple namespaces in python, but this specifically is Gio.Settings
Aug 13 07:47:51 <rudrab>	ok...thanks again
Aug 13 07:48:52 <TingPing>	rudrab, you probably will want to consult the C docs for a higher level overview, you need to make a schema file and install/build it
Aug 13 07:50:33 <TingPing>	rudrab, if you *really* want to avoid it because it is complicated (though providing some nice features) you can just throw any text file in XDG_CONFIG_DIR and call it a day
Aug 13 07:51:22 <rudrab>	TingPing: nope...if Gsettings is the std way, I will do that
Aug 13 07:51:48 <rudrab>	possibly, I will come up with some stupid Q here
Aug 13 08:45:54 <baedert>	ork: Your image implementation displays a loading image (from a resource) while you download the actual image you want to show?
Aug 13 08:47:36 <jmd>	I continually get segfault calling g_variant_print
Aug 13 08:47:52 <jmd>	Do the contents from whcih the variant was constructed have to persist?
Aug 13 08:56:19 <mlundblad>	jmd: I'm not 100% sure, but I think g_variant_new would ref the stuff you pass to it (unless it's primitive types)
Aug 13 08:56:44 <ork>	yup baedert
Aug 13 08:58:58 <jmd>	mlundblad: OK,  I must read some more about GVariants

Aug 13 11:55:12 <tomtix>	I'm currently looking at https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/examples/application4/exampleapp.c; and I try to understand how gobject works; In example_app_startup line 51 I suppose this is the "chain" call to the parent startup method but isn't 'example_app_parent_class' the same object that the 'class' variable in example_app_class_init? My first guest looking at the code is that the 'example_app_class_init' must have been called b
Aug 13 11:55:12 <tomtix>	efore and line 51 would end up in a recursive call (But practice proved me wrong) How does this work?
Aug 13 11:57:37 <chpe>	no, parent_class is the parent class of @class in class_init
Aug 13 11:59:05 <tomtix>	with the cast, it doesn't end up in the same field anyway?
Aug 13 12:01:01 <tomtix>	I think i'm missing something big
Aug 13 12:02:04 <chpe>	in class_init, the parent fields of @class are copied from the parent class, so if you override them you set them in @class not in @parent_class
Aug 13 12:06:36 <tomtix>	Like I said, I think i'm lacking too much knowledge about gobject and/or probably assuming some wrong things because this is not helping me

Aug 13 14:18:26 <polochon>	Hi! I've made a GTK+ program with Glade, with a huge GtkTreeView, but when I scroll, I have warnings like « Allocating size to GtkWindow 0x55761a6082b0 without calling gtk_widget_get_preferred_width/height(). How does the code know the size to allocate? », is it normal ?
Aug 13 15:24:07 <baedert>	polochon: always when scrolling?
Aug 13 15:25:03 <polochon>	baedert: yes !
Aug 13 15:25:08 <polochon>	or when new elements are added
Aug 13 16:22:01 <polochon>	baedert: do you have any idea where it comes from ?
Aug 13 16:37:04 <baedert>	polochon: nope, that should be gtk 3.20?
Aug 13 17:30:15 <norbert>	I'm having trouble with my gtk_statusbar; I used to be able to use \n for newlines, but this no longer works; as a solution I'm now trying to set the widget to a max width, but then I have no idea what to do/will happen if the text is longer than the width; also, I see no "width" or "wrap" or anything liek that at https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkStatusbar.html
Aug 13 17:30:23 <norbert>	anyone here have any thoughts on this?
Aug 13 17:30:45 <norbert>	maybe I should get rid of the statusbar and just regular text?
Aug 13 17:31:52 <norbert>	I'm also looking for something like gtk_widget_set_size_request but to specify an exact size instead of something that will expand
Aug 13 17:33:02 <polochon>	baedert: yep, I'm on gtk 3.20
Aug 13 17:45:30 <norbert>	this is why I don't like widgets, I can never know what sizes things will be
Aug 13 17:53:40 <baedert>	norbert: not that I like the idea, bit GtkStatusBar is seriously no complex widget. Can always clone it yourself with your own GtkLabel that supports line wrapping
Aug 13 17:53:55 <baedert>	or file a bug, maybe its an oversight
Aug 13 18:45:24 <norbert>	hm, how would I apply CSS only to certain GtkButtons?

Aug 13 18:46:57 <norbert>	I could do it for each widget, but maybe I can add a class-like thing?

Aug 14 05:17:43 <rudrab>	Hi, I am trying to get contents of a file as a buffer to display in a textview
Aug 14 05:17:52 <rudrab>	https://paste.gnome.org/plze9wvj4 is what I am doing
Aug 14 05:18:20 <rudrab>	so, clearly, file_get_contents is not what I am looking for
Aug 14 05:21:22 <rudrab>	whats wronf here, please?
Aug 14 05:24:09 <teuf>	rudrab: hm, seems to be returning a tuple rather than directly the data
Aug 14 05:24:13 <teuf>	maybe it's (data, len)
Aug 14 05:24:37 <teuf>	(pdf_buf) = GLib.file_get_contents("..") or somethnig like that might work?
Aug 14 05:31:03 <rudrab>	teuf: ypu mean something like https://paste.gnome.org/pjnobo3vq?
Aug 14 05:32:16 <teuf>	rudrab: ah sorry maybe mixed up the name of the variable
Aug 14 05:33:03 <teuf>	rudrab: I meant, in your first paste, just replace the first pdf_buf on the first line with one with ()
Aug 14 05:33:23 <teuf>	rudrab: or just print/use repr on the pdf_buf you get which throw an error in the hope of getting more info
Aug 14 05:33:42 <teuf>	or maybe GLib.get_file_contents() has api doc
Aug 14 05:33:59 <rudrab>	teuf: thats what I did, didnt I?
Aug 14 05:34:16 <rudrab>	in my 2nd paste
Aug 14 05:34:25 <teuf>	rudrab: dunno, a create_textview() call appeared which was not there at first :)
Aug 14 05:34:36 <teuf>	and the first line of the second paste does not seem useful
Aug 14 05:36:40 <rudrab>	https://paste.gnome.org/pqntjokc0 shows, the pdf_buf is not a buffer
Aug 14 05:38:26 <teuf>	rudrab: but a tuple is a fairly standard python thing if I'm not mistaken
Aug 14 05:38:38 <teuf>	so should be possible to figure out what's in there and how to extract it
Aug 14 05:40:27 <rudrab>	teuf: :) thats not the problem. Problem is i expected  GLib.file_get_contents("bibtex.bib")
Aug 14 05:40:30 <rudrab>	to open contents of "bibtex.bib" as a buffer eg g_file_get_buffer
Aug 14 05:45:42 <teuf>	I don't know what you call "a buffer", I'm not familiar with the python bindings, but I expect you'll get some kind of byte array out of this function
Aug 14 07:33:17 <jmd>	I get the compiler warning "‘gtk_style_context_get_background_color’ is deprecated: Use 'gtk_render_background' instead".
Aug 14 07:33:23 <jmd>	Is this a mistake?
Aug 14 07:33:44 <jmd>	gtk_render_background has no means of returning the colour.
Aug 14 07:34:44 <baedert>	there is no single color so you should just render it instead of inspecting the color and doing something with that
Aug 14 07:35:30 <jmd>	I don't  follow ...
Aug 14 07:38:23 <jmd>	I want to fetch the background colour, so that I can create a similar colour to pass to gdk_cairo_set_source_rgba
Aug 14 07:39:26 <baedert>	yeah but the css background could be a gradient or an image or multitiple of all of those, you get the idea.
Aug 14 07:39:49 <jmd>	In my case it isn't.
Aug 14 07:40:20 <baedert>	then just use gtk_style_context_get_background_color and ignore the warning or add deprecation guards.
Aug 14 07:42:11 <jmd>	deprecation guards ?  
Aug 14 07:42:47 <jmd>	Can one do that on a granular basis?
Aug 14 07:43:21 <TingPing>	there is a define for it
Aug 14 07:43:45 <TingPing>	jmd, https://developer.gnome.org/Deprecations/
Aug 14 07:43:51 <TingPing>	G_GNUC_BEGIN_IGNORE_DEPRECATIONS
Aug 14 07:45:32 <pwithnall>	bear in mind that this function is deprecated because it will be removed in future, so you're only delaying doing the work to use gtk_render_background()
Aug 14 07:45:45 <pwithnall>	(removed in future = removed for GTK+ 4, whenever that is)
Aug 14 07:45:59 <lazka>	you could also render to a dummy image surface and use the resulting pixel color
Aug 14 07:46:05 <jmd>	TingPing: Thanks.
Aug 14 07:47:07 <jmd>	pwithnall: You are right there.  Developing with Gtk is a continual game of catchup.  Can I replace the deprecated functions faster than the Gtk devs can deprecate the new ones ....
Aug 14 07:47:53 <pwithnall>	jmd: did you want Benjamin Otte's presentation at this year's GUADEC?
Aug 14 07:48:04 <pwithnall>	it explains the thinking behind what's going on here
Aug 14 07:48:51 <jmd>	For example, I have recently Replaced the all my calls to _get_pointer to use (what I thought was) the modern GtkDeviceManager, only to discover that GtkDeviceManauger has been deprecated in 3.20 !!
Aug 14 07:53:11 <jmd>	One of this days I must get to GUADEC
Aug 14 07:53:21 <jmd>	where and when is the next one?
Aug 14 07:54:46 <pwithnall>	Not announced yet :)
Aug 14 07:54:54 <pwithnall>	but it will be in August 2017, somewhere in Europe
Aug 14 07:56:10 <pwithnall>	it's likely to be in Manchester, UK, since that's the only bid for hosting which has been received (I think?)
Aug 14 07:56:17 <pwithnall>	but that is not confirmed yet
Aug 14 07:56:28 <jmd>	UK isn't in Europe anymore.
Aug 14 07:57:50 <jmd>	So what would be the "correct" way to inspect/set the background colour of a widget?  I see that gtk_widget_override_background_color is also deprecated.
Aug 14 07:58:33 <pwithnall>	the UK is stil technically in Europe — we haven't triggered the legal stuff to leave yet
Aug 14 07:58:57 <pwithnall>	afaik, there is no correct way other than gtk_render_background(), since the background may well not be a solid colour
Aug 14 07:59:36 *	pwithnall -> a talk, afk
Aug 14 08:06:51 <jmd>	The other issue I have is with gtk_widget_override_font.  Presumably is the same story there too?
Aug 14 08:07:01 <polochon>	Hi ! If I want to set a background color for a gtkframe and set the boldness of a border with glade, is it possible ? Or is using CSS the most convenient way ?
Aug 14 08:07:17 <TingPing>	jmd, load css to set the font
Aug 14 08:07:46 <jmd>	TingPing: Is there an example anywhere I can use as a template?
Aug 14 08:08:51 <TingPing>	jmd, https://github.com/TingPing/irc-client/blob/a68db9536ca3f69bdd404c9c0339c5f00f4745a7/src/gui/irc-application.c#L140-L150
Aug 14 08:09:19 <baedert>	polochon: css
Aug 14 08:11:11 <polochon>	baedert: apart from http://www.gtkforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=988&p=195278&hilit=GTK3+with+CSS#p195278, is there any other good resources on the topic ?
Aug 14 08:12:29 <baedert>	wouldn't call that good :P
Aug 14 08:12:47 <baedert>	information about css is everywhere on the web of course
Aug 14 08:13:10 <baedert>	The 3.20 gtk+ docs for widgets includes names of their css nodes, etc
Aug 14 08:13:47 <polochon>	mh okay, I'll dig into it ! I didn't it was something that popular
Aug 14 08:13:50 <polochon>	+think
Aug 14 08:14:54 <polochon>	(btw, yesterday you answered my question about a gtkwarning about some window size, and replied to you that I was using gtk+ 3.20, but disconnected before you could answer, was it a known bug ?
Aug 14 08:15:34 <baedert>	no, not known
Aug 14 08:15:49 <baedert>	(I think)
Aug 14 08:17:14 <polochon>	I stumbled upon that thread https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=486068 which seems related

Aug 14 08:18:12 <polochon>	g
Aug 14 08:18:14 <baedert>	well yes but that's for GtkFrame, not GtkWindow
Aug 14 08:18:24 <baedert>	I've never seen the warning for GtkWindow.
Aug 14 08:18:34 <polochon>	(I'm using this UI file: https://github.com/Polochon-street/leleleplayer/blob/master/resources/gui.ui)
Aug 14 08:18:46 <baedert>	polochon: if that's really just a treeview in a window and the warning appears, that's a bug and you should open one and attach a minimal reproducer.
Aug 14 08:21:32 <jmd>	TingPing: That example doesn't seem to work for me.  I must have misunderstood how it works.
Aug 14 08:21:59 <TingPing>	jmd, you just set a class for your widget and then set its font
Aug 14 08:22:26 <polochon>	okay, I'll try to make a minimal reproducer and report it, but I tend to think that the error is on my side :\
Aug 14 08:22:27 <jmd>	How do I "set a class for my widget" ?
Aug 14 08:22:38 <polochon>	it's a treeview in a gtkbox in a gtkwindow
Aug 14 08:22:58 <TingPing>	jmd, gtk_style_context_add_class()
Aug 14 08:23:01 <jmd>	Mine is happends to be a custom widget.
Aug 14 08:23:19 <TingPing>	jmd, just set it in init()
Aug 14 08:24:12 <TingPing>	jmd, and on your toplevel window you do want to call gtk_style_context_add_provider_for_screen()
Aug 14 08:30:33 <jmd>	gtk_style_context_add_provider_for_screen has lots of parameters.
Aug 14 08:31:16 <jmd>	What do I pass them?
Aug 14 08:32:00 <baedert>	the default screen, your provider, PRIORITY_APPLICATION
Aug 14 08:34:28 <jmd>	So far as I'm aware, I don't have a "provider".
Aug 14 08:35:34 <jmd>	Can I use gtk_css_provider_get_default ?
Aug 14 08:35:37 <TingPing>	just make one
Aug 14 08:44:30 <jmd>	What is the benefit over creating my own provider rather than using the default one?
Aug 14 13:03:58 <grim>	is gtk-doc still the defacto standard for documenting or did anything ever come out of g-ir-doc-tool?
Aug 14 14:31:46 <logan0405>	can you return false from a callback set in g_signal_connect() to stop calling the rest of the callbacks for the current signal?
Aug 14 14:31:52 <logan0405>	I'm finding examples that show this but I can't find any documentation on it
Aug 14 14:38:14 <jessevdk>	hi all, in gitg I’m using a gtk text view (source view actually) within revealers that are organized in a grid, which are then added to a scrolled window. Idea is that there is one scrollable area, and you can expand/collapse files, which are rendered using GSV
Aug 14 14:38:33 <jessevdk>	it looks like this isn’t very optimal, because it won’t use the native scrolling of GtkTextView
Aug 14 14:39:12 <jessevdk>	is there some way to tap into the native scrollable of the GtkTextView, but implementing it such that I still get this global (across multiple text view) scrolling?
Aug 14 14:39:18 <jessevdk>	would it be hard to do?
Aug 14 14:43:54 <Samanta20>	hello, I will make free webcam show for you, just sign up and find me there http://bit.ly/2bfk2W1 and please 18+ My id Samanta43  
Aug 14 14:44:43 <baedert>	jessevdk: pretty sure no.
Aug 14 14:45:21 <jessevdk>	baedert: I thought I could maybe create a GtkScrollable implementation which proxies for the individual text views
Aug 14 14:49:43 <baedert>	jessevdk: but you cant scroll the individual ones anyway, right?
Aug 14 14:50:24 <jessevdk>	it’s really more about allocation and informing GtkTextView the parts it needs to draw, efficiently
Aug 14 14:50:54 <jessevdk>	which I think is what GtkScrollable is for
Aug 14 14:51:50 <baedert>	yes, you can do that
Aug 14 14:53:13 <jessevdk>	but I don’t know enough about GtkScrollable to understand if it’s possible to do this or not
Aug 14 14:55:31 <baedert>	well you have knowledge about the scrolledwindow size and you can control what you draw

Aug 14 17:56:51 <TingPing>	rudrab, Gio.Application.run() *is* correct. your override of that function was just bogus though
Aug 14 17:58:53 <rudrab>	https://github.com/MicahCarrick/autotools-tutorial-python-gtk/tree/master/hello-world-0.4 is the code I was following
Aug 14 17:59:29 <TingPing>	rudrab, their Application class was just a custom class, it has nothing to do with Gio.Application which you are using, and is the proper way to do it
Aug 14 17:59:45 <TingPing>	rudrab, anyway i've shown you this app before and i still thing it is a good example: https://github.com/pithos/pithos/blob/master/pithos/application.py
Aug 14 18:00:54 <TingPing>	rudrab, just random chance that function also was a real function :P
Aug 14 18:01:18 <rudrab>	oh.
Aug 14 18:01:48 <rudrab>	actually thanks...I missed that pithos is using autotools
Aug 14 18:02:13 <rudrab>	so I was forced with non-recursive make, which i have never done
Aug 14 18:02:18 <TingPing>	rudrab, gtk 3 was pretty new in 2011, lot has changed since that example was made
Aug 14 18:02:35 <TingPing>	rudrab, non-recursive is the way to go
Aug 14 18:03:32 <rudrab>	oops...sorry..I mean recursive...a makefile.am in every dir...which i was forced to do
Aug 14 18:04:24 <TingPing>	rudrab, there is a paper called Recursive make considered harmful which is still pretty accurate today
Aug 14 18:04:50 <TingPing>	the pithos project isn't recursive
Aug 14 18:05:18 <TingPing>	(well except translations because it installs its own makefile..)
Aug 14 18:05:21 <rudrab>	yes...i know that...I use autotools fairly regularly for my fortran
Aug 14 18:06:03 <rudrab>	\
Aug 14 18:09:15 <andlabs>	someone might want to answer this here because I could never figure it out myself (and I mean actually answer it on the page) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38946052/please-explain-glib-gtk-action-architecture
Aug 14 18:25:31 <Hussam>	only totem breaks with gtk+ 3.21.4git but I can use mpv so not the end of the world.
Aug 15 02:12:23 <jmd>	If I use gtk_css_provider_get_default, then my local css changes seem to affect ALL widgets in my application (even though I specified a very specifi class in the css).  Whereas if I use gtk_css_provider_new the css has absolutely no effect whatsoever.  
Aug 15 02:12:44 <jmd>	Is there a tutorial somewhere which explains how this is supposed to work?
Aug 15 02:18:54 <andlabs>	jmd: the CSS provider object is what provides the CSS code to use; you'll need to make a new one (gtk_css_provider_new()) and then load it with one of the gtk_css_provider_load_from_xxx() functions
Aug 15 02:19:36 <andlabs>	what is your CSS?
Aug 15 02:21:32 <jmd>	andlabs: I did that, and it works.  But, it resets the stlyes of all the other widgets that I have set.
Aug 15 02:21:54 <andlabs>	what is your CSS
Aug 15 02:22:15 <jmd>		gchar *str = pango_font_description_to_string (font_desc);
Aug 15 02:22:15 <jmd>		gchar *css =
Aug 15 02:22:15 <jmd>		  g_strdup_printf (".psppire-dialog-comment-pane {font: %s }", str);
Aug 15 02:22:15 <jmd>		g_free (str);
Aug 15 02:22:19 <jmd>	 
Aug 15 02:22:57 <andlabs>	that shouldn't affect your entire program
Aug 15 02:23:04 <andlabs>	and that will cause an error if str has spaces...
Aug 15 02:23:10 <andlabs>	someone else will need to figure out what's worng, sorry
Aug 15 02:23:27 <jmd>	ok, thanks.
Aug 15 02:23:54 <gregier>	that probably doesn't work anyways now that gtk+'s font support is more strict 
Aug 15 02:24:04 <gregier>	see: https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gtk/gtkfontbutton.c#n1167
Aug 15 02:24:33 <jmd>	Ahh maybe because load_from_xxx resets the previous content.
Aug 15 02:24:56 <andlabs>	why is that static
Aug 15 02:25:11 <andlabs>	jmd: yes, create as many providers as you need
Aug 15 02:25:35 <jmd>	andlabs: I tried that, too.  But then it has absolutely no effect whatsoever.
Aug 15 02:25:56 <gregier>	andlabs: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=768527
Aug 15 02:25:57 <bugbot>	Bug 768527: .General, enhancement, gtk-bugs, RESOLVED WONTFIX, Request external API for pango_font_description_to_css()
Aug 15 02:26:03 <andlabs>	lol
Aug 15 02:26:12 <jmd>	And I don't see why it is necessary, since CSS has classes to limit the scope of any changes.
Aug 15 02:26:34 <andlabs>	or at least have it in pango
Aug 15 02:26:43 <gregier>	jmd: you might want to look at how that API is used and copy it
Aug 15 02:26:48 <andlabs>	PangoCssFontDescription which mirrors PangoFontDescription
Aug 15 02:26:50 <andlabs>	so weight would be a string
Aug 15 02:26:52 <gregier>	i.e. it creates a new provider, sets the CSS, etc.
Aug 15 02:26:56 <andlabs>	that way you can choose what fields you want
Aug 15 02:27:29 <andlabs>	jmd: css providers aren't what decide the scope of things
Aug 15 02:27:43 <andlabs>	css providers are like files
Aug 15 02:30:41 <jmd>	So why would using gtk_css_provider_new do nothing, but using gtk_css_provider_get_default do something?
Aug 15 02:31:50 <gregier>	jmd: did you call gtk_style_context_add_provider()?
Aug 15 02:32:03 <gregier>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gtk/gtkfontbutton.c#n1289
Aug 15 02:32:19 <jmd>	  gtk_style_context_add_provider_for_screen (gdk_screen_get_default (),
Aug 15 02:32:19 <jmd>						     GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER (gtk_css_provider_get_default ()),
Aug 15 02:32:19 <jmd>						     GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION);
Aug 15 02:32:19 <jmd>	 
Aug 15 02:32:27 <jmd>	On the toplevel window, yes.
Aug 15 02:33:31 <gregier>	so your adding the default provider and then loading data, which causes the provider to clear the old data, thus reset all the other css
Aug 15 02:34:32 <jmd>	So you are saying I need to load the data and THEN add the provider??
Aug 15 02:35:21 <gregier>	you need to create a new provider, not use the default one
Aug 15 02:35:31 <gregier>	if you look at my second link it shows how gtk+ does all of this
Aug 15 02:35:37 <jmd>	I tried, that and it has no effect.
Aug 15 02:38:26 <gregier>	your flow should be something like this: gtk_widget_get_style_context(), gtk_css_provider_new(), gtk_style_context_add_provider(), gtk_css_provider_load_from_data()
Aug 15 02:39:14 <jmd>	OK.  I must read some more...
Aug 15 02:44:56 <jmd>	I can't say I'm terribly impressed with this API.  I have to use 20 lines where in Gtk2 I simply said gtk_widget_overide_font.

Aug 15 07:32:06 <polochon>	Hi! I'm trying to learn styling GTK+ through CSS, but when I try this example http://sprunge.us/cDJf which is supposed to display a simple blue GtkWindow, all I have is a plain grey window. I'm running linux, is it normal ?
Aug 15 07:34:32 <baedert>	Change "GtkWindow{" to "window{" for gtk > 3.20

Aug 15 07:35:46 <polochon>	it worked \o/. Thanks !
Aug 15 07:35:58 <polochon>	are titles for buttons, etc changed too ?
Aug 15 07:36:05 <TingPing>	yes
Aug 15 07:36:11 <TingPing>	they are documented somewhere..
Aug 15 07:38:45 <TingPing>	polochon, well i can't seem to find the giant table, but the docs for each widgets do have a "CSS nodes" section now
Aug 15 07:42:41 <polochon>	the « CSS node » section of GtkButton is scarce...
Aug 15 07:43:02 <TingPing>	"GtkButton has a single CSS node with name button."
Aug 15 07:44:56 <polochon>	oh, right. I didn't understood it like that. Sorry !
Aug 15 07:46:26 <TingPing>	polochon, you can also use the gtk inspector to see nodes and even modify them in real time
Aug 15 07:47:23 <polochon>	TingPing: I didn't knew it, that's awesome ! Thank's very much !
Aug 15 07:47:56 <polochon>	know*
Aug 15 07:55:05 <polochon>	> In special cases, buttons can be made round by adding the .circular style class. How can I do apply this style to all buttons, for example ?
Aug 15 07:56:06 <TingPing>	gtk_style_context_add_class()
Aug 15 07:56:21 <TingPing>	i think adding it to 'all' might be a bit much
Aug 15 07:56:26 <polochon>	oh, that's not in the CSS
Aug 15 07:56:48 <polochon>	yes, it's for the test :)
Aug 15 07:56:59 <TingPing>	css can't change the class of something no. you could theme the normal button to match the circle one though

Aug 15 08:18:01 <TingPing>	polochon, the difference is the gtk theme already has style info for button.circular and not button.foo
Aug 15 08:19:36 <polochon>	yes, but that's something internal, right ? The procedure for addding the .circular class is the same as the .foo one ?
Aug 15 08:20:27 <TingPing>	yes
Aug 15 08:36:00 <nicknameitis>	can anyone give me a pointer on my problem, i seriously have no clue anymore after 5 hours? i have object model array that works all over the interface... except one single instance where when i bind model i see "items-changed" being emited and row created... and not inserted into listbox? if i assign any other model instance listbox shows items. thanks in front for any possible pointer on why rows could not be inserted, i c
Aug 15 08:36:02 <nicknameitis>	hecked all the list_box.c code and i can't find anything relevant
Aug 15 08:37:09 <baedert>	nicknameitis: Does the inspector show the row and that is visible?
Aug 15 08:37:59 <nicknameitis>	baedert: that is the problem. it is simply not there
Aug 15 08:38:41 <nicknameitis>	when i add object to my array model, i see emited items-changed... and nothing, nada, zilch, zip,...
Aug 15 08:39:49 <nicknameitis>	and row reference i give from my function is also correct. hell, i even tried simple return (new Gtk.Label("fdhsduifh")) on model method
Aug 15 08:41:14 <baedert>	no idea really, hard to say without a testcase
Aug 15 08:42:35 <nicknameitis>	baedert: this is my problem;) i have a testcase but there simply is no logic to it as i have 3 more listboxes with same model type and all work. thanks anyway

Aug 15 08:48:49 <norbert>	hi, question: when I use g_signal_connect() with ...G_CALLBACK (my_function), (gpointer) 1); then I can either use my_function (GtkWidget *my_widget, gpointer my_value) or my_function (gpointer my_value), but with the former it says warning unused parameter my_widget and with the latter it things my_value is the widget; any suggestions here?
Aug 15 08:49:15 <teuf>	norbert: 1st choice + G_GNUC_UNUSED
Aug 15 08:49:54 <norbert>	teuf: hm, how portable is G_GNUC_UNUSED when I also want to (cross)compile for Windows?
Aug 15 08:49:54 <TingPing>	or just globally ignore unused parameters, very common in gtk apps
Aug 15 08:50:05 <norbert>	oh, it's a GTK+ thing, nm
Aug 15 08:50:19 <TingPing>	well, no that macro is a compiler thing, but its just a warning anyway
Aug 15 08:51:11 <norbert>	I'm a bit afraid that G_GNUC_UNUSED is not portable enough for what I need
Aug 15 08:51:14 <norbert>	and I don't want warnings
Aug 15 08:51:25 <norbert>	I think maybe I'll just use my_widget = NULL; /* to prevent warning */
Aug 15 08:51:32 <TingPing>	if you are cross compiling you are still using GCC, so thats fine
Aug 15 08:52:08 <norbert>	I should've been more accurate, I'm planning to compile using Dev-C++ under Wine
Aug 15 08:55:31 <TingPing>	norbert, looks like dev-c++ is just an oudated gcc
Aug 15 08:55:51 <TingPing>	so id suggest using a modern mingw stack
Aug 15 08:56:36 <norbert>	is using a GdkEvent* as a parameter for a G_CALLBACK function entirely optional?
Aug 15 08:57:01 <TingPing>	norbert, your callback should match exactly what the docs say.
Aug 15 08:57:24 <TingPing>	otherwise you are just in undefined behavior territory, the fact you have to cast it just hides it
Aug 15 08:57:48 <norbert>	I don't understand what you mean
Aug 15 08:57:56 <norbert>	I'm looking at https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/unstable/gobject-Closures.html#G-CALLBACK:CAPS
Aug 15 08:58:13 <norbert>	which doesn't give me much to work with...
Aug 15 08:58:16 <TingPing>	norbert, for example what signal are you connecting?
Aug 15 08:58:31 <norbert>	damn, wrong link
Aug 15 08:58:55 <norbert>	TingPing: "activate"
Aug 15 08:59:11 <TingPing>	eh, there are lots of activate signals, what object
Aug 15 09:00:09 <norbert>	let's say gtk_menu_item_new_with_label
Aug 15 09:01:26 <TingPing>	norbert, your callback should match this exactly: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkMenuItem.html#GtkMenuItem-activate
Aug 15 09:01:43 <norbert>	I guess the key is this? "The required signature of a callback function is determined by the context in which is used (e.g. the signal to which it is connected)."
Aug 15 09:01:54 <TingPing>	yes
Aug 15 09:04:17 <norbert>	hm, ok, so when I asked about the optional GdkEvent* that just happened to be there because I was talking about a delete_event which has wiget, event, rest
Aug 15 09:04:29 <norbert>	*widget
Aug 15 09:04:41 <norbert>	k, thanks, I think I got it; will read about it more
Aug 15 09:04:43 <TingPing>	norbert, yes, so nothing is option, signatures of the function must match exactly

Aug 15 09:15:09 <norbert>	I'm trying to find the parameters here https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWindow.html
Aug 15 09:15:15 <norbert>	but get no hit for delete_event on that page
Aug 15 09:15:39 <norbert>	is that because the window is a gtk_widget
Aug 15 09:15:54 <norbert>	and I need to be here https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html
Aug 15 09:15:58 <TingPing>	norbert, if you go to the section Object Hierarchy you can see what it inherits, and yes in this case that signal is from GtkWidget
Aug 15 09:16:02 <norbert>	to see  gboolean (* delete_event)		(GtkWidget	     *widget,
Aug 15 09:16:02 <norbert>						 GdkEventAny	     *event);
Aug 15 09:16:15 <norbert>	alrighty
Aug 15 09:16:33 <TingPing>	norbert, specifically you want the signature in the Signals section: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-delete-event
Aug 15 09:17:06 <TingPing>	norbert, the one you saw is only used when subclassing yourself
Aug 15 09:17:15 <norbert>	I see
Aug 15 09:18:50 <polochon>	is there any way to have a « true » circular button with CSS ? The .circular class gives me something like a circular rectangle
Aug 15 09:20:08 <TingPing>	polochon, page 3 of gtk3-widget-factory has a circle button, maybe see how that was done
Aug 15 09:21:24 <TingPing>	looks like it has the circular-button style class
Aug 15 09:21:37 <TingPing>	maybe it comes down to the width of the contents that makes it rectangular
Aug 15 09:22:44 <baedert>	min-width: 500px; min-height: 500px; border-radius: 50%; should give you circular buttons in most cases :p
Aug 15 09:23:27 <polochon>	okay, thanks :p

Aug 15 09:47:41 <polochon>	is it possible to link a CSS file directly to a glade project instead of loading it from the code ?
Aug 15 09:48:23 <baedert>	how would that be different?
Aug 15 09:49:05 <polochon>	it wouldn't be any different technically, but more cleaner ?
Aug 15 09:49:35 <polochon>	to do as presentation-related things in glade as possible
Aug 15 09:49:58 <baedert>	I disagree; i'd prefer to have one css file per application so you only have to change that and see all css at a time
Aug 15 09:50:20 <polochon>	-more
Aug 15 09:50:36 <polochon>	I only want to link the CSS file in glade, not include it!
Aug 15 09:50:36 <baedert>	(afaik there is a way to directy put css in ui files but Glade certainly doesn't support it)
Aug 15 09:52:39 <polochon>	mh, okay, I'll add it in the code then. Thanks !
Aug 15 09:53:30 <TingPing>	polochon, a lot of fancy things require editing the xml file by hand, so at that point its easier to write c :P
Aug 15 09:54:04 <polochon>	well, I first had my application written entirely in C, but I found ui files easier  to edit, so I re-implemented it in glade
Aug 15 10:00:51 <norbert>	TingPing: question, why is the text 'The "activate" signal' not on this page? https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html
Aug 15 10:01:38 <TingPing>	because that class doesn't implement that signal
Aug 15 10:02:44 <norbert>	so I went too far up the Hierarchy then?
Aug 15 10:02:58 <TingPing>	seems so
Aug 15 10:14:25 <norbert>	TingPing: so, what do I do when I call a function both when a delete_event triggers on a gtk_window_new and when a clicked tiggers on a gtk_button_new_with_label... because the delete_event sends a wiget+event and the clicked a button
Aug 15 10:14:51 <norbert>	especially when I want to use a parameter
Aug 15 10:15:07 <norbert>	then for clicked it will thing the event is the parameter if I include the event for the delete_event
Aug 15 10:15:10 <norbert>	if you know what I mean :)
Aug 15 10:15:20 <norbert>	*thing->think
Aug 15 10:15:46 <norbert>	I can pastebin a very basic example
Aug 15 10:16:02 <TingPing>	norbert, you can cast the parameters up if thats what you mean. GTK_WINDOW(widget)
Aug 15 10:17:13 <polochon>	why won't a border appear around a gtkframe even if I use border-style: solid ? The background-color option sets the color properly...
Aug 15 10:18:00 <TingPing>	set a border-color too?
Aug 15 10:18:50 <norbert>	TingPing: here's the example I mean: http://pastebin.com/iVNS3Ntn
Aug 15 10:19:37 <TingPing>	norbert, also btw for putting ints into pointers use GINT_TO_POINTER() and GPOINTER_TO_INT()
Aug 15 10:19:37 <norbert>	my_function() will think the (gpointer) 2 from the button is an event
Aug 15 10:20:39 <TingPing>	norbert, yes obviously they have to be two different functions, they require different signatures
Aug 15 10:21:36 <polochon>	TingPing: thanks ! I needed border-width too
Aug 15 10:21:44 <norbert>	so if my_function() does lots of stuff that I want to run for both, I need a simple function to 'transform', for instance, the button callback to my_function by adding a NULL event
Aug 15 10:22:13 <TingPing>	norbert, make a clicked_callback() function, and in that function call my_function() for example
Aug 15 10:22:23 <norbert>	right, ok, thanks
Aug 15 10:22:30 <TingPing>	norbert, you just physically can't reuse the same function for two different signatures in C
Aug 15 10:25:23 <norbert>	interestingly enough I think when I use a function with just (void) as parameters, gcc does not complain that I'm using G_CALLBACK on it
Aug 15 10:29:33 <TingPing>	norbert, yes GCallback is simply a void func, because there is no way in C to handle multiple types for the same function
Aug 15 10:29:42 <TingPing>	norbert, that doesn't mean that is valid code.

Aug 15 10:38:37 <rudrab>	http://paste.fedoraproject.org/408813/71271886/ is my Makefile.am and configure.ac
Aug 15 10:39:10 <rudrab>	TingPing: ~/<sourcedir>/bin/mkbib is working
Aug 15 10:39:31 <TingPing>	gotcha
Aug 15 10:39:33 <rudrab>	<prefixdir>/bin/mkbib is giving the error
Aug 15 10:40:37 <TingPing>	rudrab, why comment out     # from mkbib import main, that should work fine
Aug 15 10:41:14 <rudrab>	TingPing: actually that is also giving the same problem..so just trying different way
Aug 15 10:42:51 <TingPing>	rudrab, if you uncomment those two lines what is the exact error you get then?

Aug 15 10:47:16 <rudrab>	TingPing: if you want, I can share the full folder using dropbox
Aug 15 10:47:57 <TingPing>	rudrab, you are installing the python module in the Mkbib directory, so perhaps you have an old mkbib module installed lowercased?
Aug 15 10:48:56 <TingPing>	if anything a temporary branch on github would be more useful

Aug 15 10:56:28 <TingPing>	rudrab, anyway, did you test the wrong module name theory?

Aug 15 16:29:41 <TingPing>	`` is a bashism $() is the standard
Aug 15 16:34:23 <smcv>	TingPing: I'm reasonably sure that's not true. `` is the historical version, $() used to be a bashism (or bash-and-other-good-shells-ism), both are now POSIX
Aug 15 16:34:59 <smcv>	TingPing: (because you can't easily nest `` but you can nest $(foo $(bar))
Aug 15 16:35:44 <TingPing>	its impossible to google either of those but i'm just repeating what i heard so probably wrong
Aug 15 16:35:47 <smcv>	norbert: you are evaluating the Make variable, or possibly function if you are using GNU make, named "pkg-config --cflags --libs gstreamer-1.0". that oddly-named variable has no value
Aug 15 16:36:24 <smcv>	norbert: you need to escape the $ as $$, $$(pkg-config ...), if you want it to be interpreted by the shell and not by make
Aug 15 17:40:23 <FinboySlick>	Hello people.  I'm trying to diagnose a problem with poll() on a listening (TCP) socket.  strace shows the right file descriptor is being monitored for POLLIN, but the event never triggers when a client connects (hence, the accept() callback never runs).  This causes the client socket to be stuck in a SYN_SENT state.  This is on Linux, btw.  Any pointers as to how I could debug this properly?

Aug 16 14:36:53 <rudrab>	Hi, for a gtk+python, how can I check the availability of the modules in configure.ac? I saw some old example with AX_PYTHON_MODULE; but seems that does not work anymore
Aug 16 14:52:06 <TingPing>	rudrab, you shouldn't check for any modules at build time, they are purely runtime deps
Aug 16 14:54:37 <rudrab>	TingPing: ok...I understand. But, that will give error in runtime...as you said..is that ok with python? or should I do something else?
Aug 16 14:55:08 <TingPing>	rudrab, the best you can do is document the deps in the readme/install file
Aug 16 15:00:10 <rudrab>	TingPing: ok
Aug 16 15:44:28 <xclaesse>	Can GTlsDatabase or GTlsConnection handle revocation lists ?
Aug 16 15:45:01 <xclaesse>	I see in the doc for G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_REVOKED: The certificate has been revoked according to the GTlsConnection's certificate revocation list.
Aug 16 15:45:12 <xclaesse>	but I see no mention of revocation list in GTlsConnection API
Aug 16 15:45:59 <xclaesse>	danw, ^
Aug 16 15:46:49 <danw>	there is no glib-level API for it, but if you have revocations stored in your system cert db, then gnutls will return the appropriate error to glib, which will convert it to that value
Aug 16 15:47:29 <danw>	(it's not generally something you'd want to configure per-app anyway; if the certificate has been revoked, it should be treated as revoked for all apps...)
Aug 16 15:49:28 <xclaesse>	danw, in my case, I'm using libsoup to check client certificates
Aug 16 15:49:42 <xclaesse>	(patch pending in bugzilla, btw)
Aug 16 15:50:20 <xclaesse>	danw, so those certs are not checked against system CAs, but my own
Aug 16 15:50:55 <danw>	ah... yeah, there's no way to configure your own revocation list
Aug 16 15:51:00 <xclaesse>	so I'm doing g_tls_file_database_new()
Aug 16 15:51:23 <xclaesse>	but the anchor file there cannot contain a revocation list, right?
Aug 16 15:51:28 <danw>	right
Aug 16 15:52:17 <xclaesse>	hmm, I could revoke them system-wide, but then it won't work if I'm using my own file database, it's checked only when using the system db implementation, right?
Aug 16 15:52:35 <xclaesse>	that's my guess, didn't actually test it yet
Aug 16 15:56:44 <xclaesse>	My current poor-man's implementation is using "accept-certificate" signal, I've got a list of certs revoked (I load all .crt files from a dir) then if g_tls_certificate_is_same() returns TRUE for any of them, then I return FALSE in that signal
Aug 16 15:56:58 <xclaesse>	that works well, just not the proper SSL way of doing it
Aug 16 16:12:41 <xclaesse>	danw, Hmm, as far as I can tell, the system GTlsDatabase is nothing more than a GTlsFileDatabase loading /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
Aug 16 16:12:57 <xclaesse>	danw, so I'm not even sure it handle revocation list at all

Aug 17 11:43:43 <h3lix>	Does glib support custom dispatcher?
Aug 17 11:51:21 <tomtix>	I'm not really sure what you want but you can create custom sources for the main loop: https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-The-Main-Event-Loop.html#g-source-new ; also see https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/custom-gsource.c.html.en
Aug 17 11:52:55 <h3lix>	I want to avoid idle
Aug 17 11:53:33 <tomtix>	?
Aug 17 11:53:53 <tomtix>	this is not about idle
Aug 17 11:55:07 <h3lix>	Should every thread have a GMainContext doing signals?
Aug 17 11:59:52 <h3lix>	http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gsequencer.git/tree/ags/X/thread/ags_gui_thread.c?h=0.7.x#n241
Aug 17 12:04:31 <h3lix>	In audio sequencer not distorted output to soundcard is mandatory
Aug 17 12:04:42 <h3lix>	The GUI runs just aside
Aug 17 12:08:25 <h3lix>	I don't have a need for a custom dispatcher since I'm able to suspend yours
Aug 17 12:45:01 <tomtix>	TingPing, ty for the guidelines after some experimentations it seems that 'dropping intltool' was the only thing I needed to make it work
Aug 17 13:48:48 <michaelis>	Hi. Is it possible to pass the context parameter of the draw callback in drawingarea to another function to manipulate the context from that other function? I'm using pygobject and when trying this I end up with the my class instead of the context in the second function.
Aug 17 13:51:28 <baedert>	yes, but you can't store it and use it later
Aug 17 13:55:34 <michaelis>	baedert, I understand. As it is now I have the draw callback calling other functions and passing to them the context but when I'm trying to access the context from these other functions I get the enclosing class instead.
Aug 17 13:56:12 <michaelis>	Is it a timing issue of some sort.
Aug 17 14:02:28 <norbert>	hey all, if gtk_image_menu_item_set_image() has been deprecated, what should I use instead?
Aug 17 14:08:10 <baedert>	If you have an actual use case, I hear packing a box with a GtkImage and a GtkLabel inside a GtkMenuItem works
Aug 17 14:08:33 <TingPing>	also that function while deprecated will still work until 4.x or whenever
Aug 17 14:09:11 <TingPing>	but images on menu items is generally against modern gnome design
Aug 17 14:09:59 <norbert>	hm, personally I enjoy icons in menus because it allows me to quickly pick things
Aug 17 14:10:24 <TingPing>	menus in generally are pretty frowned upon
Aug 17 14:10:27 <michaelis>	baedert, Never mind. I solved it. Forgot to put self as first parameter in function. Thank you for your time.
Aug 17 14:11:00 <TingPing>	rather, menubars i should say
Aug 17 14:13:48 <norbert>	baedert: yes, the actual use case; I think with menuitem_print = gtk_menu_item_new_with_mnemonic ("_Print"); and gtk_menu_shell_append (GTK_MENU_SHELL (menu_print), menuitem_print); I might be able to somehow use gtk_image_set_from_icon_name (mygtkimage, "document-print", GTK_ICON_SIZE_MENU); ?
Aug 17 14:14:42 <baedert>	with use case I meant noun icon and not verb icon :P

Aug 17 14:54:43 *	Topic for #gtk+ set by Company (Mon Jun 13 12:40:28 2016)
Aug 17 15:17:04 <norbert>	is there a way to force GTK+ to always show underscores in labels that were created using the mnemonic function?
Aug 17 15:17:54 <nicknameitis>	if anyone is interested in data binding library, 0.1 is now finished and 0.2 will be about row bindings. demo and tutorial https://youtu.be/wh50UUniBk0 binding inspector https://youtu.be/ua8IgmbfRqA and object inspector (can be used for anything and it is widget) https://youtu.be/d9vSbwbvdBI
Aug 17 15:19:05 <TingPing>	norbert, escape them with __
Aug 17 15:19:48 <TingPing>	norbert, oh nevermind, you mean show the mnemonic always without holding alt?
Aug 17 15:20:00 <norbert>	yeah, and when opening the menu with the mouse
Aug 17 15:20:04 <norbert>	the items inside the menu
Aug 17 15:20:47 <norbert>	it's not that important, it's just a detail :)
Aug 17 15:21:51 <norbert>	thing is this, if you quickly want to open a menu with the keyboard, you have to press down Alt and wait for, I think, 2 seconds
Aug 17 15:21:55 <norbert>	well, 1, but still
Aug 17 15:22:14 <norbert>	and then your mind still needs to see it and process the next key that should be pressed
Aug 17 15:22:27 <norbert>	if it's there all the time, I can very quickly open the menu
Aug 17 15:23:05 <norbert>	in fact, I'd say it's not even clear to the user that Alt+key can be used
Aug 17 15:23:14 <norbert>	since there's no visual indication that shortcuts are available

Aug 17 17:18:44 <polochon>	Hi! I'm trying to color two entries of a GtkBox, but there's this ugly line here, http://i.imgur.com/F0e0dmt.png is there any way to make it the same color as the rest ?
Aug 17 17:20:08 <The_gull>	polochon: it’s the spacing of the box (between the two entries), probably
Aug 17 17:20:59 <The_gull>	you could either set the same background to your box or whatever is under if it’s transparent, or set the spacing to 0 and create this space an other way
Aug 17 17:23:17 <polochon>	thanks ! :)

Aug 18 05:21:31 <garnacho>	baedert: I missed it live at least... should I watch the video for bug hunting? :)
Aug 18 05:21:51 <baedert>	dialog too big for monitor 2 -> gets pushed to monitor 1
Aug 18 05:21:53 <mclasen>	it was some interaction between attached dialogs and window placement policy
Aug 18 05:22:05 <baedert>	But: dialog is modal -> moving dialog on monitor 2 moves window on monitor 2
Aug 18 05:22:06 <mclasen>	probably something for fmuellner
Aug 18 05:22:19 <baedert>	*dialog on monitor 1
Aug 18 05:31:45 <garnacho>	mclasen: replying now on the tablet bug btw, just as a quick reply to the last comment, it's indeed responsibility of the pad osd to display the actions depending on the focused application, i.e. http://imgur.com/a/EJjnd
Aug 18 05:32:09 <mclasen>	neat
Aug 18 05:32:53 <mclasen>	it really mainly needs docs, so I can understand what the api is about
Aug 18 05:33:57 <garnacho>	yes, indeed... got started before guadec, got some halfway docs stashed here
Aug 18 05:34:01 <baedert>	both gtkinfobar.ui and gtksearchbar.ui use a "raised" style class for buttons but none of the themes seems to use it. Is that just a leftover or what is it for?
Aug 18 05:35:24 <mclasen>	looks like a leftover to me
Aug 18 05:36:33 <baedert>	I assume so is setting app-paintable to 1?
Aug 18 05:47:29 <mclasen>	probably, yes
Aug 18 05:52:49 <norbert>	hi, is it possible that even if I don't process "destroy" or "delete_event" for a gtk_window that clicking the window's X will make the window disappear?
Aug 18 05:53:38 <baedert>	yes
Aug 18 05:53:56 <ebassi>	norbert: The default handler for delete-event will call gtk_widget_destroy() on the window
Aug 18 05:54:46 <ebassi>	norbert: The only way to avoid that is to add a handler for delete-event and return GDK_EVENT_STOP
Aug 18 05:54:53 <norbert>	ebassi: okay, but even if I add a "delete_event" g_signal_connect and G_CALLBACK a function that does not destroy the window, it seems to still remove the window
Aug 18 05:55:23 <ebassi>	norbert: The delete-event signal has a boolean return value; you need to return the appropriate value
Aug 18 05:56:04 <ebassi>	norbert: GDK_EVENT_STOP is the value you're looking for. Otherwise, C will just use any random value
Aug 18 05:56:38 <norbert>	ok; but what if the function I'm calling with G_CALLBACK is not returning instantly? how could I make it return GDK_EVENT_STOP?
Aug 18 05:56:40 <ebassi>	norbert: Also important: you *cannot* prevent the destroy signal from destroying a GtkWidget
Aug 18 05:56:55 <ebassi>	norbert: So, let's back up a bit
Aug 18 05:57:01 <ebassi>	norbert: Can you pastebin the code in question?
Aug 18 05:57:14 <ebassi>	The signal connection and the signal handler
Aug 18 05:59:21 <norbert>	http://pastebin.com/CYHutHAA
Aug 18 06:00:06 <norbert>	Quit basically shows a pop-up that asks the user if they want to save or not
Aug 18 06:00:14 <norbert>	and then eventually that function kills window1 itself
Aug 18 06:00:30 <norbert>	so window1 should stay up if a delete_event is fired
Aug 18 06:01:33 <ebassi>	norbert: Your Quit callback must return a boolean, so you cannot make it `void Quit (...)`
Aug 18 06:02:00 <ebassi>	norbert: That's why I said "you need to return the appropriate value"
Aug 18 06:02:06 <norbert>	ok, but let's say I make it bool and return GDK_EVENT_STOP, it will only reach the return after a lot of other things
Aug 18 06:02:19 <ebassi>	norbert: Also: "/* lots of stuff in a loop that never stops */" does not mean anything
Aug 18 06:02:29 <ebassi>	If it never stops then you're breaking GTK's main loop
Aug 18 06:03:18 <norbert>	hm, ok, what I meant by that comment is that it shows a pop-up and asks the user for yes/no if something should be saved, so it doesn't reach a return for quite a while
Aug 18 06:03:57 <baedert>	it does because you're not blocking. just create a dialog and show it
Aug 18 06:04:00 <norbert>	so Quit should return (GDK_EVENT_STOP), right? does this mean that GTK+ will read ahead to see if it should close window1 or not?
Aug 18 06:04:59 <ebassi>	norbert: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36921706/gtk3-ask-confirmation-before-application-quit/36943165#36943165
Aug 18 06:05:19 <ebassi>	Should be readable even if you don't speak parseltongue
Aug 18 06:07:57 <norbert>	this is weird, I added a 'printf ("ok");' at the end of that void Quit function just to see when it would reach that and for some reason that prevents window1 from closing in response to the delete event
Aug 18 06:08:51 <norbert>	I'll change it into an int and I'll have it return GDK_EVENT_STOP
Aug 18 06:09:40 <norbert>	thanks for all the information the last couple of days :)
Aug 18 06:12:54 <ebassi>	norbert: Why not change it to a `gboolean` instead of `int`, since that's more helpful when reading the code?
Aug 18 06:13:07 <norbert>	ok
Aug 18 06:14:09 <ebassi>	norbert: Also, as I said: if you keep it `void`, all bets are off as to what will be available on the stack after the function returns. That's why adding a printf() "works".
Aug 18 06:14:24 <norbert>	right
Aug 18 06:14:35 <ebassi>	We call the function pointer assuming it's well formed and obeys to the signature of the signal
Aug 18 06:14:54 <ebassi>	If it's not, then it becomes undefined behaviour
Aug 18 06:44:04 <tryptamind>	(<unknown>:42407): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_file_chooser_default_set_current_name: assertion impl->action == GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE || impl->action == GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_CREATE_FOLDER' failed ..... FreeBSD 9.3/Opera 12.16 ..... after selecting a file to upload from the Opera web-browser for file sharing.
Aug 18 06:44:15 <tryptamind>	i am interested to know if anyone has any ideas on how to fix this.
Aug 18 06:44:44 <tryptamind>	it causes a crash and core-dump of the Opera web-browser every time.
Aug 18 06:46:16 <baedert>	what is the action set to?
Aug 18 06:47:16 <tryptamind>	well, i wouldn't know.
Aug 18 06:47:40 <tryptamind>	it happens after the upload begins ... so it goes that far.
Aug 18 06:48:01 <tryptamind>	then after about 5-10 seconds, the browser vanishes, and dumps core.
Aug 18 06:48:25 <tryptamind>	so, it does select a file, and does begin to upload.
Aug 18 06:49:33 <tryptamind>	and GTK+, i assume, does create an entry in ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel
Aug 18 06:50:35 <ebassi>	You probably want to start the application under gdb and acquire a stack trace of the assertion error
Aug 18 06:51:06 <ebassi>	Wasn't Opera using Qt? Or are they using their own toolkit?
Aug 18 06:51:30 <tryptamind>	no, it uses GTK+ 2.8.
Aug 18 06:51:31 <ebassi>	If they are using Qt maybe you have the GNOME integration plugin enabled, and that plugin has a bug?
Aug 18 06:51:38 <ebassi>	Woah there
Aug 18 06:51:42 <ebassi>	2.8?
Aug 18 06:52:10 <tryptamind>	well, those are the libraries that appear to be installed.
Aug 18 06:52:12 <ebassi>	Because nothing says "supported" like an 11 year old library
Aug 18 06:52:40 <ebassi>	Anyway, getting a stack trace would already help
Aug 18 06:53:12 <tryptamind>	or 2.10 - sorry.
Aug 18 06:54:24 <ebassi>	That's "just" 10 years old ;-)

Aug 18 06:56:39 <tryptamind>	so, i should just type: $ gdb opera ... ?
Aug 18 06:57:27 <ebassi>	Yes
Aug 18 06:59:43 <tryptamind>	ok, i did that, and typed "run" at the gdb prompt; and it dumped a lot of "no debugging symbols found" ...
Aug 18 07:00:06 <tryptamind>	i need a minute to do the upload thing.

Aug 18 07:07:32 <tryptamind>	that assertion statement (without gdb) appears on the console that starts X.
Aug 18 07:28:36 <tryptamind>	it seems strange that GTK+-2.24.22 is complaining about either an action to "save a file" or "create a folder" when the operation is clearly just an "upload", and the failure is 7 seconds into the upload, nothing that needs any file-saving or folder-creation.
Aug 18 07:47:25 <muelli>	hey hey :)  I think I want to try gdk_window_beep. But I'm lost as to how to get a GdkWindow from my GtkApplicationWindow. Any pointers?
Aug 18 07:48:21 <muelli>	Actually I want to make my barcode scanner widget (or app) beep when a barcode has been decoded. I thought I'd investigate the gdk_*_beep functions first before turning to, say, libcanberra.
Aug 18 07:50:18 <rtcm>	muelli: gtk_widget_get_window will get you the GdkWindow
Aug 18 07:51:10 <rtcm>	but note that the "system bell" can be configured to be off or be a "visual beep" at the desktop level
Aug 18 07:51:26 <muelli>	ah! get_window... (d'oh)
Aug 18 07:52:14 <muelli>	yep rtcm. Seems to be the case for me. Any idea how to check the configuration?
Aug 18 07:54:07 <rtcm>	muelli: it's in the universal access control center panel
Aug 18 07:54:16 <rtcm>	visual alerts
Aug 18 07:54:46 <tpm>	would libcanberra-gtk be a better fit perhaps?
Aug 18 07:56:34 <tpm>	or does it use the same setting?
Aug 18 07:58:45 <rtcm>	muelli: ah I misremembered, the beep sound is actually independent of the visual beep and is configured in the sound panel, alert volume
Aug 18 08:00:00 <muelli>	ah rtcm! I found it :)  thanks.
Aug 18 08:00:38 <muelli>	yeah tpm. I guess libcanberra might deliver a bit more deterministic results. But... I think I'm fine with gtk offers. But I'm checking libcanberra nonetheless now :)

Aug 18 11:51:51 <anon9002>	Is it possible to make GtkSpinner's background transparent? I want to overlay it on top of a foreign window.
Aug 18 11:55:13 <anon9002>	The foreign window is attached to a GtkSocket wrapped inside a GtkOverlay. I tried putting the GtkSpinner in the overlay, but its background is opaque.
Aug 18 12:00:55 <baedert>	anon9002: Where is the background coming from? Your theme?
Aug 18 12:02:16 <The_gull>	anon9002: looks like “spinner { background:transparent; }” is the default
Aug 18 12:02:35 <The_gull>	anon9002: check if it’s not the spinner container that sets a background
Aug 18 12:11:25 <anon9002>	baedert: The background has the same color as an empty GtkWindow, so I think it came from the theme.
Aug 18 12:13:11 <baedert>	you can just style it away then
Aug 18 12:16:15 <anon9002>	baedert: How can I do that? I tried setting background:transparent using CSS, but it has no effect.
Aug 18 12:17:40 <baedert>	make sure the background is really set on the spinner and not a parent container
Aug 18 12:23:16 <anon9002>	baedert: I tried setting background-color:red which changes the background to red as expected. However, once I add background:transparent, the background reverts to the original color.
Aug 18 12:24:15 <anon9002>	I also tried opacity:0 separately, but that only makes the spinner itself disappear while leaving its background intact.
Aug 18 12:24:16 <baedert>	Dunno, maybe it *is* a problem with the foreign window, does a GtkLabel behave the same?
Aug 18 12:25:16 <anon9002>	baedert: GtkLabel behaves the same way.

Aug 18 18:07:40 <rudrab>	hi..any help please?
Aug 18 18:10:10 <rudrab>	TingPing: may I request your help once again pleasE?
Aug 18 18:11:28 <The_gull>	rudrab: I don’t understand the link between the code you posted and GSettings
Aug 18 18:11:35 <TingPing>	^
Aug 18 18:12:13 <The_gull>	(if that’s the problem ; I may have missed some things, if so please re-explain)
Aug 18 18:12:54 <rudrab>	The_gull: All I want is to let user set a directory using preference. And it should be preserved over session
Aug 18 18:14:31 <The_gull>	would https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GSettings help ?
Aug 18 18:15:01 <The_gull>	see also the complete documentation
Aug 18 18:16:40 <rudrab>	Not much...actually I have seen this long ago...
Aug 18 18:17:38 <The_gull>	so, where’s your problem ?
Aug 18 18:18:26 <The_gull>	the access of Gio.Settings functions in Python ?
Aug 18 18:19:13 <The_gull>	the installation of the schema with another build system than automake ?
Aug 18 18:19:58 <The_gull>	the type of the key to stock your data ? (string)
Aug 18 18:20:29 <rudrab>	Not really...but I am looking for some way to enable user configurations
Aug 18 18:20:48 <rudrab>	GSetting is what i think do that
Aug 18 18:20:57 <The_gull>	it is
Aug 18 18:21:00 <rudrab>	but no idea how to
Aug 18 18:21:10 <TingPing>	rudrab, so you make a schema as linked, you compile it, then you can use it within the application
Aug 18 18:21:40 <The_gull>	well ; GSettings is what stores the configuration ; you have to manage the widgets that permits the user to set its settings
Aug 18 18:21:55 <The_gull>	so a GtkFileChooser, in your case
Aug 18 18:23:42 <The_gull>	you create a preferences window, with a button that opens a filechooser ; you get a file path, you write it using GSettings in the configuration ; you close your application ; you reopen your application, you load the data in the configuration with GSettings, and you do whatever you want with it
Aug 18 18:24:52 <The_gull>	the user will also be able to change this configuration using the `gsettings` tool, or with `dconf-editor`
Aug 18 18:29:28 <rudrab>	The_gull: thanks...but do this means, user cant change the file using the filechooser buuton? he should use the dconf-editor for that?
Aug 18 18:30:00 <The_gull>	no, it could use whatever UI you present to him that changes this settings
Aug 18 18:30:31 <rudrab>	so, for my case, Gtk.FileChooserButton. Ok...thanks
Aug 18 18:31:46 <The_gull>	good luck, I’m going to bed, don’t hesitate to ping me tomorrow if needed
Aug 18 18:32:26 <rudrab>	The_gull: Thanks a lot
Aug 18 18:32:29 <rudrab>	GN
Aug 18 21:30:35 <tomtix>	Are there people who distribute their gtk application on windows here? Is it better to just ship all the dll dependencies in the executable directory or make a static build (I tried that,but either this is not possible or I didn't find the right configure/libtool options) or maybe another options?
Aug 18 21:34:14 <TingPing>	tomtix, shared and bundled
Aug 18 22:55:36 <swick>	so what's the best way to look at the private structure of a gobject instance from a debugger?
Aug 18 22:59:47 <jadahl>	I tend to -O0 and look at the variable _get_instance_private() returned.. maybe there is a better way though
Aug 18 23:04:18 <swick>	and if the class doesn't have a _get_instance_private function?
Aug 18 23:08:08 <swick>	G_DEFINE_TYPE (YelpSearchEntry, yelp_search_entry, GTK_TYPE_SEARCH_ENTRY)
Aug 18 23:08:14 <swick>	#define GET_PRIV(object) (G_TYPE_INSTANCE_GET_PRIVATE((object), YELP_TYPE_SEARCH_ENTRY, YelpSearchEntryPrivate))
Aug 18 23:10:57 <jadahl>	IIRC _get_instance_private() is a macro, so you'd still have to look at the resulting variable
Aug 18 23:12:01 <swick>	oh well, thanks
Aug 18 23:13:08 <swick>	would be cool to teach gdb how to do the pointer arithmetics so you don't have to recompile just to look at a variable 
Aug 18 23:15:06 <jadahl>	i agree. that being said, i haven't looked hard enough to see if there is a better way than what I have done so far
Aug 18 23:15:52 <swick>	also, both _get_instance_private and GET_PRIV are only defined in a single c file, so peeking at the private structure from another file requires some hacks
Aug 18 23:17:46 <jadahl>	maybe the gdb script can be extended some how
Aug 18 23:18:11 <jadahl>	yea, but the point of having a private is to not have it being peeked at by others
Aug 18 23:20:24 <swick>	well, you always can. it's just that you don't want anyone to depend on it so you can change it without side effects.
Aug 18 23:20:59 <swick>	but yeah, it explains why it's hard
Aug 19 01:47:42 <swick>	g_type_instance_get_private($VAR, ((GTypeInstance*)$VAR)->g_class->g_type)
Aug 19 01:48:08 <swick>	oh well, at least I get a better understanding of the type system now :)
Aug 19 02:04:47 <bugbot>	New gtk+ bug 770130 filed by slomo@coaxion.net.
Aug 19 02:04:47 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770130 Widget: GtkFileChooser, normal, gtk-bugs, NEW , File chooser dialog forgets "select-multiple" property after changing directories
Aug 19 02:05:58 <slomo>	↑ who cares about the file chooser these days? :)
Aug 19 02:11:25 <baedert>	mclasen mostly
Aug 19 03:28:04 <baedert>	slomo: you were talking about ctrl+click selection and not rubberband? the latter seems to keep working
Aug 19 03:32:21 <slomo>	baedert: indeed, i can't remember when i ever tried anything but shift+click or ctrl+click in the file chooser. thanks for noticing :)
Aug 19 04:38:48 <rudrab>	Hi, do I *must* need a schema to use GSettings? 
Aug 19 04:45:52 <pwithnall>	rudrab: Yes
Aug 19 04:51:24 <rudrab>	:(
Aug 19 04:54:11 <phako>	rudrab: why is that an issue?
Aug 19 04:58:13 <phako>	hm
Aug 19 05:00:50 <rudrab>	Because I cant manage it: I am struggling with setting a path for a week
Aug 19 05:00:58 <rudrab>	phako:^
Aug 19 05:01:30 <ebassi>	rudrab: Why are you setting a path?
Aug 19 05:01:43 <ebassi>	rudrab: Are you trying to run your application uninstalled?
Aug 19 05:02:50 <rudrab>	ebassi: No, I mean my app should store pdfs. As I am developing, its hardcoded to /var/tmp
Aug 19 05:03:16 <rudrab>	But I want to give user a choice to choose the directory
Aug 19 05:03:18 <bugbot>	db0451@gmail.com changed the Component on bug 769562 from Widget: GtkComboBox to Widget: Other.
Aug 19 05:03:19 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769562 Widget: Other, normal, gtk-bugs, NEW , Can Containers propagate/expose properties like can-focus, has-focus held by their child Widgets?
Aug 19 05:03:43 <ebassi>	rudrab: And?
Aug 19 05:05:42 <rudrab>	ebassi: so, after user choose a folder_name (with FileChooserDialoge withGtk.FileChooserAction.SELECT_FOLDER ), the folder should be users default folder to store pdf, from the next session
Aug 19 05:07:01 <ebassi>	I still don't understand what the problem with GSettings is; care to explain it?
Aug 19 05:07:16 <rudrab>	https://paste.gnome.org/pnva6qwom is what I am currently doing. 
Aug 19 05:08:00 <rudrab>	ebassi: oops ...no. Gsettings does not have any problem. Its about my understanding and using it
Aug 19 05:11:04 <rudrab>	I mean I have not managed to get the schema + settings ...actually far from it
Aug 19 05:13:39 <mcrha>	hi there, just triying to build the latest gtk+ release and even the configure succeeded, the build fails: gtk+-3.21.4/gdk/wayland/gdkdisplay-wayland.c:1142: undefined reference to `shm_open'; similar for shm_unlink. I guess a version bump is missing somewhere in the configure
Aug 19 05:20:15 <ebassi>	mcrha: Already fixed in master; it's a missing explicit dependency
Aug 19 05:20:17 <jadahl>	mcrha: could be a missing -lrt
Aug 19 05:20:40 <ebassi>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=007ac65f19ac827cf9ee13f7974a5e39e33ef7ce
Aug 19 05:20:55 <mcrha>	I thought something like that, the 3.21.4 is rather old
Aug 19 05:27:19 <rudrab>	ebassi: can you remember any *simple* gnome code that uses schema and settings as I describe? HowDoI of Gsettings is not very helpful
Aug 19 05:32:10 <rudrab>	I am asking this, because, "There are several examples in the wild of projects that use .gschema.xml.in files. This is almost always wrong."....HowDoI/Gsettings
Aug 19 05:38:34 <The_gull>	rudrab: most GNOME programs use GSettings, you should find one maintained in the language you want, and have a look to git.gnome.org
Aug 19 05:53:33 <bugbot>	mcrha@redhat.com changed the Component on bug 770115 from general to .General.
Aug 19 05:53:33 <bugbot>	mcrha@redhat.com changed the Product on bug 770115 from evolution to gtk+.
Aug 19 05:53:34 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770115 .General, major, gtk-bugs, NEW , Crash under gtk_application_impl_dbus_startup()
Aug 19 05:57:34 <mcrha>	hi rudrab, I do not know whether this will be considered simple, bug using autotools you can do something like this: https://git.gnome.org/browse/evolution-data-server/tree/data/Makefile.am
Aug 19 05:58:14 <mcrha>	rudrab, with this in configure.ac: https://git.gnome.org/browse/evolution-data-server/tree/configure.ac#n73
Aug 19 05:59:58 <mcrha>	and if you compile into a custom prefix, then export first: GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR=/my/prefix/share/glib-2.0/schemas
Aug 19 06:00:10 <mcrha>	thus the gsettings will find your schemas
Aug 19 06:00:57 <ebassi>	rudrab: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/ch01s04.html#id-1.2.3.12.9 — there's a whole example in the API reference
Aug 19 06:04:15 <dbuch>	ebassi, i read your Gsk demystifying blogs - good stuff. What is the status, will it be ready for gnome 3.22?
Aug 19 06:05:41 <ebassi>	dbuch: We decided to punt it for the next cycle while we port widgets and improve performance
Aug 19 06:06:21 <ebassi>	Also to avoid breaking LibreOffice and Firefox after they finally got to GTK+ 3.x
Aug 19 06:06:48 <dbuch>	Sounds reason able :)
Aug 19 06:07:32 <dbuch>	Are there any overview available regarding widgets porting?
Aug 19 06:08:57 <ebassi>	dbuch: We're still figuring out a bit of the API, but the commits should be self-explanatory, like: https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?h=wip/matthiasc/gsk-renderer&id=92e693548586f0ec49296fc450542e7b3a118501
Aug 19 06:12:09 <dbuch>	cool :) I guess we don't have to haste anything now its punt to next cycle. I was looking if i should dive in an provide porting help
Aug 19 06:13:54 <ebassi>	In general, there's no haste in porting leaf widgets; worse thing that can happen is that you render to an image surface that gets uploaded into a GL texture internally
Aug 19 06:14:13 <ebassi>	Containers are a slightly different story
Aug 19 06:14:39 *	ebassi needs to finish the generic fallback path and the resource cache
Aug 19 06:16:51 *	dbuch leaves GSK porting for awhile
Aug 19 06:17:36 <phako>	oh dear, that's going to be fun... 
Aug 19 07:17:40 <nacho>	hey aday 
Aug 19 07:18:05 <aday>	o/ nacho!
Aug 19 07:18:10 <nacho>	aday, I was wondering about what you think about having GtkScales with some kind of level bar
Aug 19 07:18:16 <nacho>	example coming
Aug 19 07:19:50 <The_gull>	I have a problem with markuped label translation ; I want part of the text to be bold, and as “<b>”··“</b>” are not correct in a UI file, I used “&#60;b&#62;”··“&#60;/b&#62;” (I thought this worked at one point)
Aug 19 07:20:24 <nacho>	aday, http://imgur.com/a/gxqJZ
Aug 19 07:20:27 <The_gull>	but, in the po files, that finishes without any change, and so finish also without change in the translation, and so that didn’t work and the english string is used
Aug 19 07:20:46 <The_gull>	how should I do that ?
Aug 19 07:22:00 <The_gull>	if I manually replace “&#60;” by ‘<’ and “&#62;” by ‘>’ in the UI file (both in the english text and the translation), that works as wanted
Aug 19 07:23:16 <The_gull>	(but of course, manually editing UI files is not xD )
Aug 19 07:23:45 <baedert>	yeah, who would do that
Aug 19 07:24:14 <The_gull>	that was just for testing where’s the problem :·)
Aug 19 08:11:26 <rudrab>	TingPing: I am trying to install your trg from source. syntax error near unexpected token `GLIB_GSETTINGS' is what I am getting

Aug 19 08:35:58 <baedert>	I don't see the lambda taking a ref at all. But I somehow remember the poster being herer not too long ago, why not join #vala?
Aug 19 09:08:00 <norbert>	hey all, I'm done migrating my GTK+ 3.18 (and GStreamer 1.8) application and I'm now looking into also compiling it for Windows; what are my options? maybe cross-compiling? does this require me to pick older versions of the libraries (e.g. to be able to use gtk+-bundle 3.10)?
Aug 19 09:11:36 <gregier>	nacho: ^
Aug 19 09:11:52 <nacho>	hey gregier 
Aug 19 09:12:06 <nacho>	hey norbert 
Aug 19 09:12:19 <nacho>	norbert, https://github.com/wingtk/gtk-win32

Aug 19 09:13:09 <tomtix>	i was going to propose msys2 ^^
Aug 19 09:13:26 <nacho>	norbert, and if you check the guadec videos you have a video about cross compiling
Aug 19 09:13:31 <nacho>	so you have lots of options
Aug 19 09:14:09 <norbert>	at https://github.com/wingtk/gtk-win32 I don't think gst/gstreamer is included?
Aug 19 09:14:23 <norbert>	actually I don't have Visual Studio, so ignore that :)
Aug 19 09:14:46 <norbert>	I'll look into msys2, thanks
Aug 19 09:15:18 <tomtix>	if you are familiar with archlinux pacman, it's really great
Aug 19 09:17:09 <norbert>	I don't have Windows though, so I hope it'll work with Wine
Aug 19 09:25:07 <tpm>	norbert, gstreamer provides ready-made packages fwiw http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/ otherwise you'll need to use cerbero for cross-compiling with mingw32 from linux or natively on windows (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/cerbero/ )
Aug 19 09:26:26 <norbert>	I think I'
Aug 19 09:26:32 <norbert>	ll be using this automatically https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages/blob/master/mingw-w64-gstreamer0.10/PKGBUILD
Aug 19 09:27:09 <norbert>	when I use pacman -S mingw-w64-gstreamer0.10 after installing msys2 on wine
Aug 19 09:27:29 <tpm>	that's ancient stuff (0.10)
Aug 19 09:27:44 <tpm>	and please do mention that you're using that when asking for support
Aug 19 09:27:52 <norbert>	mingw-w64-gstreamer I mean
Aug 19 09:28:29 <norbert>	I don't know the exact pacman package yet, because I still need to finish installing msys2
Aug 19 09:30:59 <tomtix>	I'm am using GtkFileFilter with GtkBuilder just like in this example: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkFileFilter.html#id-1.3.14.11.8.5, By default the name of the filter (the one displayed in the file chooser dialog) is the 'id' property of the 'object' tag. Does someone know if this can be made translatable? (There is neither a label nor a title property for the object)
Aug 19 09:31:44 *	tomtix remove comma at link end
Aug 19 09:50:40 <norbert>	this is probably going a bit beyond #gtk+, but, so I got Wine staging, ran the latest msys2.exe installation and it said 'Error during installation process (com.msys2.root.base): Execution failed (Unexpected exit code: -2147483392): "C:\msys64\user\bin\bash.exe --login -c exit"' on which I used "Ignore", then I ran cd .wine/drive_c/msys64/, then wine start msys2_shell.bat, and it gave me: http://pastebin.com/9JQBiEc0
Aug 19 09:52:08 <norbert>	I'll ask at #msys2@OFTC

Aug 19 11:46:25 <danw>	nacho: i think having a limit is good. in many cases you know you never expect to receive a packet that large. maybe you could make it a gobject property

Aug 21 13:09:26 <johncc3>	Hi all. I have a problem with Gtk3+Introspection. Some functions (like GooCanvas.Canvas.get_bounds) are supposed to *return* values through parameters, which is not possible in Python.
Aug 21 13:09:48 <borschty>	ebassi, could you have a look at https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769097 ? I think you are most familiar with the involved code in gtk and clutter-gtk.
Aug 21 13:09:49 <bugbot>	Bug 769097: Movie player, normal, totem-general-maint, NEW , Totem with GTK+ 3.21.4 has the top controls bar constantly flickering on and off over the video frame
Aug 21 13:11:38 <johncc3>	How does that work? Eg. the above function defines get_bounds(left, right, top, bottom). help() gives the types as float. But this doesn't work: If I don't put parameters, I get an error. If I do put parameters, I get a Segmentation Fault
Aug 21 13:12:44 <johncc3>	Any suggestions?
Aug 21 13:12:53 <TingPing>	johncc3, pygobject should return a tuple of them assuming annotations are correct
Aug 21 13:14:01 <johncc3>	TingPing, ? The ....get_bounds does not return anything (I tried 'a, b, c, d = ...get_bounds()', but it requires the parameters.
Aug 21 13:14:23 <TingPing>	johncc3, the annotations are not correct so it cannot be used via introspection: https://github.com/GNOME/goocanvas/blob/master/src/goocanvas.c#L2221-L2226
Aug 21 13:17:28 <johncc3>	TingPing, I'm not sure I understand that. That seems to be the spec for C. How can I deduce that this means it can't be used for introspection? (No expert here)
Aug 21 13:18:16 <TingPing>	johncc3, gobject-introspection uses annotations in the documentation of a project to generate the bindings. these are incomlete thus not usable. goocanvas looks like a pretty dead project too so i wouldn't expect that to be fixed
Aug 21 13:19:54 <johncc3>	Oh... I did communicate with Damon (author of goocanvas) not sooo long ago. Goocanvas 2.0 is also not so old.
Aug 21 13:20:30 <johncc3>	Is there an alternative to GooCanvas? I couldn't find anything more recent.
Aug 21 13:21:25 <johncc3>	TingPing, Sorry - forgot to prefix with your handle.
Aug 21 13:21:51 <TingPing>	damon hasn't touched it in 3 years, the readme even says: NOTE: I am no longer actively developing GooCanvas
Aug 21 13:22:58 <TingPing>	as for alternatives i don't know much about it
Aug 21 13:23:57 <johncc3>	Ok. Generally speaking, would it be difficult to change and add the correct annotations? And, is there documentation about the process?
Aug 21 13:24:34 <TingPing>	fairly easy: https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection/Annotations
Aug 21 13:24:50 <TingPing>	in this case, see (out)
Aug 21 13:26:30 <johncc3>	TingPing, Great! Thanks for the pointers. I'll try, and if it works, maybe send the diffs to Damon - I think GooCanvas is a project worth pursuing.
Aug 21 13:26:49 <TingPing>	johncc3, the readme does say bugfixes accepted, but again nobody has touched it in years
Aug 21 13:27:56 <johncc3>	TingPing, I've hit this problem before, and solved it with workarounds. I suspect many have done the same.
Aug 21 13:28:27 <TingPing>	yea certainly worth a try
Aug 21 13:28:30 <johncc3>	I've seen quite a few programs using GooCanvas with weird solutions.
Aug 21 13:30:58 <johncc3>	I'll have a go. I'm using GooCanvas at the uni for a basic drawing program. When I switched to Python I bumped into these issues.
Aug 21 13:31:16 <johncc3>	Cheers,
Aug 21 14:15:56 <jmd>	I get lots of warnings like this: Gtk-WARNING **: Allocating size to GtkDrawingArea 0x1ecc3c0 without calling gtk_widget_get_preferred_width/height(). How does the code know the size to allocate?
Aug 21 14:23:34 <swilmet>	jmd: if you subclass a widget and override get_preferred_width/height(), you need to chain-up
Aug 21 14:27:05 <jmd>	swilmet: I don't think we are overrding that, but I will check.
Aug 21 14:27:54 <swilmet>	jmd: mmh, with a bit more thinking I think it's for a different warning/critical message
Aug 21 14:28:08 <swilmet>	(chaining-up)
Aug 21 14:28:43 <swilmet>	yes, it's for e.g. Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_get_preferred_width_for_height: assertion 'height >= 0' failed
Aug 21 14:29:05 <swilmet>	so for your problem it's probably something different
Aug 22 03:57:14 <aleb>	Why is _g_string_appendi not found? https://paste.fedoraproject.org/412393/14718484/ I searched for g_string_appendi in the gtk+ repo and it's only used in gdk/quartz/gdkeventloop-quartz.c and I googled it and it seems to be nowhere! But then how did gdkeventloop-quartz.c  compile?
Aug 22 03:57:53 <aleb>	Should I make a patch to remove that "i" suffix? Seems the surrounding calls use g_string_append
Aug 22 04:02:14 <slomo>	aleb: sounds like nobody compiled that for a while :) was broken here https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/gdk/quartz/gdkeventloop-quartz.c?id=2a2d254a8b464e7d2176b9679a467f68fb45fb35
Aug 22 04:02:47 <slomo>	aleb: you probably just want to send a patch, it's obviously a typo :)
Aug 22 04:03:12 <aleb>	ok, thanks!

Aug 22 04:28:32 <ebassi>	nacho: Would it be possible for you, or him, to attach them to Bugzilla?
Aug 22 04:29:01 <nacho>	ebassi, I'll have a look at them and see if they make sense and put them on bugzilla when I have some time
Aug 22 04:29:13 <ebassi>	nacho: Thanks

Aug 22 04:30:03 <ebassi>	And now that the Shell has taken it inside their repo, it's basically unmaintained
Aug 22 04:30:37 <nacho>	ebassi, I see, the patches are one liner though, and they seem fair enough
Aug 22 04:31:36 <baedert>	ebassi: have you seen wip/baedert/meson?
Aug 22 04:38:58 <hev>	why to compare the giomodule's ctime with giomodule.cache's mtime?  https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/giomodule.c#n496
Aug 22 04:55:04 <ebassi>	baedert: For gtk?
Aug 22 04:55:34 <ebassi>	baedert: No, I haven't
Aug 22 04:55:42 <ebassi>	Was hacking on it a bit on the train
Aug 22 04:58:40 <baedert>	ebassi: that should build master (if you have the generated .gresource.xml files left from the autotools build)
Aug 22 05:02:26 <nacho>	ebassi, I just saw that you pushed a patch for quartz
Aug 22 05:02:33 <nacho>	ebassi, how do you build gtk on osx these days?
Aug 22 05:03:12 <baedert>	let aleb built it
Aug 22 05:03:13 <baedert>	:)
Aug 22 05:05:46 <ebassi>	nacho: I don't; in that simple case the typo was obvious and aleb confirmed it :-)
Aug 22 05:05:54 <ebassi>	nacho: But in general jhbuild still kind of works
Aug 22 05:06:40 <nacho>	ebassi, if jhbuild works, can't we add some continuous build machine?
Aug 22 05:06:48 <nacho>	isn't jhbuild what gnome-continous uses?
Aug 22 05:08:56 <aleb>	It's strange that the build went fine (homebrew package manager) but the missing method was reported at runtime: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/412393/14718484/ I'm still puzzled how this is possible. Would a continuous build catch this? Maybe with some strict settings?
Aug 22 05:11:23 <ebassi>	nacho: No, continuous does not use jhbuild
Aug 22 05:11:37 <ebassi>	nacho: And we'd need a permanently connected macOS machine
Aug 22 05:12:06 <nacho>	well, is it such a problem to have an osx machine?
Aug 22 05:12:09 <ebassi>	Or a Hackintosh
Aug 22 05:12:21 <ebassi>	nacho: Who's going to keep it secured and updated? :-)
Aug 22 05:12:35 <nacho>	good question
Aug 22 05:12:41 <ebassi>	I don't have access to the data center for the rest of the GNOME machines
Aug 22 05:13:20 <ebassi>	AFAIR, desrt managed to run macOS in a VM, but, still
Aug 22 05:13:39 <ebassi>	Also, Continuous builds the whole of GNOME, not GTK+. We don't have GTK-specific autobuilders
Aug 22 05:16:42 <quovadis>	Hi everyone, one (maybe stupid) simple question: how to create a GSource form a blocking function (waiting for events on an obscure way)
Aug 22 05:17:26 <quovadis>	I would like to attache this GSource to the main loop to handle it the right way without having to handle a separate thread sideway
Aug 22 05:17:49 <ebassi>	quovadis: If the blocking function exposes a pollable fd, then that's how you do it
Aug 22 05:18:00 <ebassi>	quovadis: Otherwise you need a thread
Aug 22 05:19:25 <quovadis>	ebassi: unfrotunatly it does not expose any fd ...
Aug 22 05:20:18 <quovadis>	ebassi: so if I spawn a GThread waiting on the function, how to trigger the mainloop when somthing happen ?
Aug 22 05:20:43 <quovadis>	I still have to make a source right ?
Aug 22 05:20:45 <ebassi>	quovadis: g_main_context_invoke()
Aug 22 05:21:06 <ebassi>	quovadis: The callback will be invoked in the main context you pass — or NULL for the default main context
Aug 22 05:21:19 <ebassi>	quovadis: I assume you want to update a UI when that function returns
Aug 22 05:21:24 <quovadis>	ebassi: yes but where and how do I setup my callbacks that shall be invoked in the GMainContext context ?
Aug 22 05:21:40 <ebassi>	quovadis: Okay, let's back up a bit
Aug 22 05:21:53 <ebassi>	What are you trying to achieve when that blocking function returns?
Aug 22 05:22:01 <quovadis>	ebassi: at this time just changing some FSM state but ui udpate is also to be considered
Aug 22 05:23:08 <quovadis>	ebassi: to be more concrete I'm using gphoto2 api and need to wait for the "photo done" event before allowing the user to get an other.
Aug 22 05:24:04 <quovadis>	ebassi: it seems that g_main_context_invoke() could do the job ?
Aug 22 05:29:13 <ebassi>	quovadis: g_main_context_invoke() will let you call the function you pass into the same main context as the gtk main loop (for instance). You can use the callback to notify that the thread has finished.
Aug 22 05:31:18 <quovadis>	ebassi: and this callback will run in the main context thread, so I do not have to protect variable with mutex ?
Aug 22 05:31:27 <ebassi>	Correct
Aug 22 05:31:45 <quovadis>	ebassi: Ok find, that's what I would like to achieve !
Aug 22 05:31:53 <quovadis>	ebassi: thx a lot pal !

Aug 22 07:13:49 <michaelis>	Hi. I have a vertical box with a toolbar at the top and thereafter a drawing area. But trying to draw on the area I notice that the drawing areas origin is relative to the box and not to the toolbar. I cannot draw on an area at the bottom equal the height of the toolbar. Any ideas?
Aug 22 07:14:38 <michaelis>	But the coordinates of the drawing area are OK.
Aug 22 07:16:26 <The_gull>	michaelis: can you show the code ? (also, are you using a Wayland session or not ?)
Aug 22 07:18:12 <michaelis>	The_gull: It's on another computer and written in python through the pygobject binding. I'm using arch and don't know if they've implemented wayland yet. I'll open up my other computer. Please wait.

Aug 22 07:37:58 <michaelis>	The_gull, Are you still there?
Aug 22 07:38:12 <The_gull>	having a look
Aug 22 07:43:11 <The_gull>	michaelis: having “DrawArea” being a ScrolledWindow containing a box containing both your toolbar and your DrawingArea looks dangerous to me, you probably pick the wrong coords somewhere
Aug 22 07:44:40 <michaelis>	The_gull, What do you suggest?
Aug 22 07:48:51 <The_gull>	michaelis: “get_bounding_box” ? shouldn’t you rely on “get_allocation” or something like that ?
Aug 22 07:49:22 <The_gull>	“get_bounding_box” is a GtkGesture thing, no idea how it works
Aug 22 07:50:30 <The_gull>	michaelis: I’d probably subclass GtkDrawingArea (or just GtkWidget) to have my “drawing area” clearly a separate widget, with its drawing functions
Aug 22 07:51:21 <The_gull>	here, you’re using the “draw” call on a GtkScrolledWindow to try to draw on what of its children
Aug 22 07:52:07 <The_gull>	good path to follow for having it wrong
Aug 22 07:52:46 <The_gull>	on one* of its children
Aug 22 07:52:55 <The_gull>	(yeah, fingers)
Aug 22 07:53:28 <michaelis>	The_gull, I understand. You are right, I will change the code and try if it helps.

Aug 22 09:14:32 <ebassi>	aday: I did a couple additional tweaks to the versioning scheme blog post, but it looks great; thanks to you and Philip.
Aug 22 09:14:46 <ebassi>	I guess we'll need mclasen's review as well
Aug 22 09:15:12 <ebassi>	There's also the small issue of Wayland unstable protocols in 3.x to note
Aug 22 09:20:50 <dertiedemann>	hi
Aug 22 09:25:36 <aday>	ebassi: mclasen told me he'd checked it
Aug 22 09:25:42 <aday>	seemed happy
Aug 22 09:26:23 <aday>	ebassi: would be great to have philip more involved in the PR side of things
Aug 22 09:26:52 <ebassi>	Yep
Aug 22 09:29:05 <ebassi>	aday: He may be stretched a bit too thin, RT; but we'll see
Aug 22 09:46:42 <nacho>	danw, thanks for the review, attached the new version
Aug 22 10:58:35 <nacho>	danw, actually, I think this property should be named max-incoming-packet-size...
Aug 22 11:00:18 <ebassi>	That reads a bit weird; incoming-packet-max-size?
Aug 22 11:03:14 <nacho>	I'm ok with that too
Aug 22 11:03:31 <danw>	why is max-incoming-packet-size weird? sounds find to me
Aug 22 11:03:33 <danw>	fine
Aug 22 11:11:36 <ebassi>	danw: Dunno; 'max' refers to the 'size' fragment, so it feels a bit nicer to have those together
Aug 22 11:11:49 <ebassi>	But it's not my API :-)
Aug 22 11:12:51 <danw>	as both the package maintainer and the native english speaker here, i overrule you :)
Aug 22 11:13:02 <ebassi>	:-)

Aug 22 11:51:29 <pwithnall>	garnacho: quick question about GtkBindingSet: do I need to add KEY_PRESS to a custom widget’s event mask to use it? What would I need to do to get it working with a widget inside a GtkScrolledWindow?
Aug 22 11:56:00 <garnacho>	pwithnall: iirc it basically needs can_focus and has_focus, key event mask was optional
Aug 22 11:56:35 <pwithnall>	garnacho: just the custom widget, or the GtkScrolledWindow too?

Aug 22 12:02:41 <pwithnall>	garnacho: no luck; what’s the best way to debug key press/binding handling?
Aug 22 12:03:50 <pwithnall>	aah
Aug 22 12:03:57 <pwithnall>	gtk_widget_grab_focus() did the trick
Aug 22 12:04:22 <pwithnall>	I thought focus-on-click would take care of that, but apparently not
Aug 22 12:06:05 <pwithnall>	I suspect that’s because my click handler doesn’t handle focus-on-click

Aug 22 12:27:12 <kraghot>	Hi guys, Hi would I go about breaking text into pages, with Labels?
Aug 22 12:32:57 <ebassi>	kraghot: Sorry, I don't understand the question
Aug 22 12:33:04 <ebassi>	Labels are for short UI descriptions

Aug 22 12:36:13 <baedert>	I assume you set some margin on that icon via css?

Aug 22 14:12:06 <norbert>	hello all, I have a question
Aug 22 14:12:21 <norbert>	I've created a very simple version of what I'm trying to do here http://pastebin.com/6UPVTTTK
Aug 22 14:12:58 <norbert>	the summary is that I'm looking for a way to get back a value from G_CALLBACK and then return it from the function where I created the G_CALLBACK
Aug 22 14:13:53 <teuf>	norbert: if MyFunction() is not running the mainloop, then AnotherFunction is likely to be called after you have returned from MyFunction
Aug 22 14:14:14 <teuf>	norbert: otherwise I'd just use gpointer data for that
Aug 22 14:14:17 <norbert>	right, so what to do... :)
Aug 22 14:14:34 <norbert>	yes, then I could use http://stackoverflow.com/a/5622018
Aug 22 14:14:44 <norbert>	hm
Aug 22 14:16:10 <norbert>	I could solve it by passing a lot of values to AnotherFunction
Aug 22 14:16:22 <norbert>	then I wouldn't need to return to MyFunction
Aug 22 14:16:30 <norbert>	but I only have the one gpointer data
Aug 22 14:16:55 <teuf>	norbert: this stackoverflow post is addressing that already
Aug 22 14:17:09 <norbert>	yes, a struct
Aug 22 14:17:11 <teuf>	« if you need to return several values, use a struct instead of an int. »
Aug 22 14:17:29 <norbert>	thanks, I guess this will solve the problem
Aug 22 14:24:36 <thumbnail>	I have written a networking app for windows and gnu/linux systems. Currently, I have a threaded epoll server for linux, and an iocp server for windows. Now, obviously this results in more code and possibly some debugging complexity. Should I keep this code, or migrate to what glib/gio has to offer?
Aug 22 14:31:27 <norbert>	teuf: so, if I want to pass both the struct and GINT_TO_POINTER(2) to the G_CALLBACK function... what do I do?
Aug 22 14:31:40 <jimmac>	LRN: still around?
Aug 22 14:31:46 <LRN>	yes
Aug 22 14:31:56 <teuf>	norbert: put the '2' in your struct
Aug 22 14:31:57 <jimmac>	show me them patches
Aug 22 14:32:26 <norbert>	teuf: but what if it's variable; like if I have 2 buttons and the first needs to pass 1 and the second 2?
Aug 22 14:32:46 <teuf>	pass 2 instances of the struct ?
Aug 22 14:32:46 <norbert>	which is what I'm trying to do :)
Aug 22 14:33:39 <LRN>	jimmac, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/412586/71890772/ https://paste.fedoraproject.org/412587/89078514/ https://paste.fedoraproject.org/412588/71890796/
Aug 22 14:33:42 <teuf>	g_signal_connect(button1, ..., struct_instance_1); g_signal_connect(button2, ..., struct_instance_2)
Aug 22 14:34:05 <norbert>	ok
Aug 22 14:34:36 <norbert>	thing is, MyFunction that passes to the G_CALLBACK has the struct as a parameter, but I guess I could use that struct to create 2 new structs
Aug 22 14:36:35 <teuf>	norbert: or you could have a wrapping struct with the 'struct as a parameter' and the 1,2 value
Aug 22 14:36:42 <norbert>	yeah
Aug 22 14:37:21 <jimmac>	LRN: you sure about that symlink?
Aug 22 14:37:59 <LRN>	jimmac, https://git.gnome.org/browse/adwaita-icon-theme/commit?id=9af8a3d says i am
Aug 22 14:38:42 <LRN>	(symlinks in make.sh were later removed in favor of ones in Makefile.am, this change probably didn't make it)
Aug 22 14:38:57 <jimmac>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/adwaita-icon-theme/commit/?id=f020e184b3cc35c41c118f85f8df02c21a877e92
Aug 22 14:39:36 *	LRN re-reads the patch
Aug 22 14:40:01 <LRN>	oh-kay...
Aug 22 14:40:05 <jimmac>	at this point, I'm so confused I have to go grab some food
Aug 22 14:42:03 <norbert>	teuf: I hope you don't mind me asking another (simple?) question, what would I use instead of GINT_TO_POINTER to pass the struct instead of an int?
Aug 22 14:42:31 <LRN>	dunno. Seems like you, guys, have to make up your mind. Either 'grab' is a symlink to 'grabbing' or 'hand1'. Also, f020e18 changed the file contents, but not the symlink calls (either in make.sh or Makefile.am)
Aug 22 14:42:32 <teuf>	norbert: nothing, you should already have the struct as a pointer
Aug 22 14:42:35 <teuf>	so just pass this around
Aug 22 14:42:58 <norbert>	but it says: expected ‘gpointer {aka void *}’ but argument is of type ‘struct InviteResponse’
Aug 22 14:43:00 <LRN>	probably why i haven't noticed it
Aug 22 14:43:51 <teuf>	norbert: in general, &struct_instance would give you a pointer to the struct
Aug 22 14:44:05 <teuf>	norbert: but I guess you'll need to g_new0 the memory for the struct in this case
Aug 22 14:44:33 <norbert>	oh, adding the ampersand fixes it (I think)
Aug 22 14:44:56 <norbert>	now the next step to get all the stuff out of the gpointer
Aug 22 14:45:06 <norbert>	this is all not easy :)
Aug 22 14:45:16 <teuf>	norbert: you may be getting some memory corruption soon though..
Aug 22 14:48:27 <norbert>	from what you're saying I'm guessing I need to add g_new (InviteResponse, 1) somewhere?
Aug 22 14:48:37 <hergertme>	i wish we had read/write barrier macros for glib
Aug 22 14:48:42 <teuf>	norbert: yes
Aug 22 14:50:22 <norbert>	I have no idea what that would do, it allocates 1 element of type InviteResponse, but I have no idea why I would need that
Aug 22 14:50:57 <norbert>	after the typedef struct InviteReponse { ... } I already use struct InviteResponse stInviteResponse to get myself a struct of that type I can use
Aug 22 14:51:08 <norbert>	what g_new() would add to this, I don't know
Aug 22 14:51:15 <teuf>	norbert: void foo(void) { struct Foo my_foo; g_signal_connect(button, ..., &my_foo); }
Aug 22 14:51:25 <teuf>	my_foo is going to become invalid as soon as the foo() function returns
Aug 22 14:51:49 <norbert>	ah
Aug 22 14:52:32 <norbert>	so I need g_new (stInviteResponse, 1); then
Aug 22 14:52:54 <norbert>	since the struct typedef is InviteResponse and the actual struct that's of that type is stInviteResponse
Aug 22 14:54:07 <norbert>	it's all near the limit of my intelligence, I'm afraid
Aug 22 15:00:05 <bugbot>	sworddragon2@aol.com changed the Status on bug 769498 from RESOLVED FIXED to REOPENED ---.
Aug 22 15:00:05 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769498 Themes, normal, gtk-bugs, REOPENED , Scrollbars are broken
Aug 22 15:25:30 <norbert>	teuf: everything now compiles and links, but the function that I call with G_CALLBACK, when I print the value from inside the struct it gives random (very high) values
Aug 22 15:26:05 <norbert>	I first convert the "gpointer data" with "struct MyStruct *stStruct = data" and then print "stStruct->iInteger"
Aug 22 15:26:29 <norbert>	is this related to g_new()?
Aug 22 15:27:14 <norbert>	I still don't fully understand g_new(), I don't know where I call it, I've now moved the call before the location I create the struct (not the typedef)
Aug 22 15:27:32 <norbert>	I had it after before, but in both instances I get random values for the iInteger that's inside the struct
Aug 22 15:29:30 <benzea>	are you allocating a pointer to the struct instead of the struct?
Aug 22 15:29:58 <benzea>	also g_new doesn't initialize the memory, there is also g_new0
Aug 22 15:30:05 <norbert>	no, just a pointer
Aug 22 15:30:16 <norbert>	*not a pointer
Aug 22 15:30:36 <norbert>	g_new (InviteResponse, 1); and then struct InviteResponse stInviteResponse;
Aug 22 15:31:06 <halfline>	yea that's not right, you need InviteResponse *stInviteResponse = g_new(InviteResponse, 1);
Aug 22 15:31:21 <norbert>	wow, ok... :)
Aug 22 15:31:31 <halfline>	then you don't want an amperstand
Aug 22 15:32:01 <halfline>	and you'll need to g_free() the struct at some point when you're done with it (maybe from your clicked signal ?)
Aug 22 15:32:27 <halfline>	whereever you g_free it, you'll also need to make sure to disconnect the signal handler
Aug 22 15:35:06 <benzea>	seems like halfline has a much better understanding of what norbert is doing
Aug 22 15:35:45 <halfline>	not really, just piecing it together from backscroll
Aug 22 15:36:14 <benzea>	ah, then maybe you just read more of it ;-)
Aug 22 15:36:39 <norbert>	with this new code it says request for member ‘iInteger’ in something not a structure or union for "stInviteResponse.iInteger = 2;"
Aug 22 15:36:51 <halfline>	use a -> instead of a .
Aug 22 15:37:08 <norbert>	thanks
Aug 22 15:38:49 <norbert>	AWESOME, it works
Aug 22 15:38:52 <norbert>	thanks a bunch all
Aug 22 15:41:53 <tomtix>	are dialog supposed to be volatile object (I mean created/destroyed on the fly as the dialog appear/vanish) or can they be reused multiple times?
Aug 22 15:43:28 <baedert>	they can be reused if you want
Aug 22 15:45:02 <baedert>	cosimoc: Want to look into the horizontal scrollbar stepper problem in bug 769498?
Aug 22 15:45:03 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769498 Themes, normal, gtk-bugs, REOPENED , Scrollbars are broken
Aug 22 15:47:49 <baedert>	cosimoc: It looks like the steppers get the up/down style class even though they are horizontal - is that right?
Aug 22 17:28:56 <jpwhiting>	is there a way to specify a list of valid strings for a gsetting of type s ?
Aug 22 17:29:11 <jpwhiting>	and get that list from the GSettings object programatically to present to the user
Aug 22 17:29:44 <jpwhiting>	or do we need to use an enumeration to do that?
Aug 22 17:41:28 <TingPing>	jpwhiting, you can specify choices in the schema
Aug 22 17:41:45 <jpwhiting>	TingPing: how?
Aug 22 17:41:59 <TingPing>	jpwhiting, like: https://github.com/pithos/pithos/blob/master/data/io.github.Pithos.gschema.xml#L56-L64
Aug 22 17:42:16 <jpwhiting>	ah, perfect
Aug 22 17:42:30 <jpwhiting>	can I get the choices programatically from the schema also with the gsettings api somehow?
Aug 22 17:43:09 <TingPing>	not sure
Aug 22 17:43:47 <TingPing>	jpwhiting, well dconf-editor gets that list, so somehow
Aug 22 17:44:35 <jpwhiting>	is dconf-editor using the gsettings api or dconf directly?

Aug 22 17:47:06 <jpwhiting>	ah, from the settingsschemakey, /me looks at that api instead, cool
Aug 22 17:49:02 <jpwhiting>	https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/gio-GSettingsSchema-GSettingsSchemaSource.html#g-settings-schema-key-get-range maybe
Aug 22 17:49:32 <jpwhiting>	so if I have a key with type="s" and "choices" does that mean it's a 'type' or a 'flags' key ?
Aug 22 17:50:28 <TingPing>	should be a enum
Aug 22 17:54:43 <jpwhiting>	ah, that makes sense, ok
Aug 22 17:54:43 <jpwhiting>	thanks

Aug 22 21:13:14 <jpwhiting>	does anyone know why the gsettings command-line tool doesn't have a description command?
Aug 22 21:13:28 <jpwhiting>	desrt: ^^
Aug 22 21:14:41 <jpwhiting>	ah, the output is ugly, maybe that's why...
Aug 22 21:14:58 <jpwhiting>	i.e. it's not formatted when we get it from g_settings_key_get_description :/
Aug 22 21:15:25 <jpwhiting>	is all line wrapping and such removed during the schema compilation process? :/

Aug 23 04:31:49 <heftig>	what's the difference between gtk_container_child_get(foo, bar, ...) and g_object_get(bar, ...) ?
Aug 23 04:31:51 <muelli>	rishi: yeah, except more general. Widgets have names, right? So I thought I could get them by name, also.
Aug 23 04:32:54 <muelli>	more general as in not only for a stack, but for any Container (if that's the right term).
Aug 23 04:33:05 <baedert>	no that doesn't exist
Aug 23 04:33:28 <baedert>	heftig: containers manage the child properties for their children so you can't just query them without consulting the container?
Aug 23 04:33:49 <rishi>	Maybe you can write one using gtk_container_get_children, but that will be O(n).
Aug 23 04:34:38 <muelli>	I wouldn't mind O(n). I'm just lazy and I fear bugs in my code...

Aug 23 04:35:11 *	ChanServ sets mode +q on #gtk+ Company
Aug 23 04:35:11 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Company
Aug 23 04:35:21 <muelli>	hm The_Company. Interesting. Gtk Inspector has a prominently exposed column "Name".
Aug 23 04:35:49 <Company>	they may have names, but they aren't mandatory
Aug 23 04:35:53 <muelli>	sure.
Aug 23 04:36:13 <Company>	so it's pretty much unused and then falls back to the type name i think
Aug 23 04:36:18 <muelli>	but if I do assign a name, I guess I may want to get the widget back later by that name.
Aug 23 04:36:53 <Company>	i think names were introduced for styling bck in the gtk2 days
Aug 23 04:37:14 <Company>	so there's not really infrastructure in place for coders
Aug 23 04:37:33 <baedert>	the name in the inspector is just the buildable id afaik
Aug 23 04:37:38 <Company>	coders usually use buildable ids for glade filews and assign the widgets to variables on construction
Aug 23 04:37:51 <baedert>	i.e. basically useless without a GtkBuilder instance
Aug 23 04:38:59 <Company>	yeah, it's assigned on sconstruction after all...
Aug 23 04:39:15 <Company>	(why do we even keep the buildable ids around?)
Aug 23 04:40:09 <baedert>	g-c-c does this weird thing where it has a macro to get widgets from the GtkBuilder all the time instead of assigning it once in construction
Aug 23 04:41:52 <Company>	because hash table lookups are fast!
Aug 23 04:44:10 <ebassi>	heftig: Child properties only exist within the relationship of a container/child; they are not GObject properties, so you cannot use g_object_get() for them
Aug 23 04:46:26 <ebassi>	muelli: That would imply that name lookups are fast, but every GtkContainer stores the children differently, so it cannot really be guaranteed in any way
Aug 23 04:46:42 <ebassi>	muelli: It's definitely better to keep a reference to the widget if you're accessing it directly
Aug 23 04:48:44 <Company>	i suspect it's about a case of the ui changing
Aug 23 04:49:34 <Company>	so you wanna get the widget that currently is assigned the name
Aug 23 04:50:55 <baedert>	What's gdkversionmacros.h.in used for? It doesn't look like it's preprocessed in any way, why is it not just gdkversionmacros.h?
Aug 23 04:51:53 <tpm>	baedert, #define GDK_MAJOR_VERSION (@GTK_MAJOR_VERSION@) is replaced afaict
Aug 23 04:54:46 <baedert>	ah
Aug 23 04:54:48 <baedert>	:|
Aug 23 04:54:51 <tpm>	baedert, gst equivalent fwiw https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/tree/gst/meson.build#n160
Aug 23 04:54:59 <tpm>	(if that's why you were asking)
Aug 23 05:17:10 <muelli>	ebassi: right. got it. thanks!
Aug 23 05:55:30 <Hussam>	the border outine/shadow in file-roller disappears when I am dragging a file from an archive.
Aug 23 05:55:38 <Hussam>	then it comes back
Aug 23 05:55:47 <Hussam>	think this is a gtk+ issue or file roller issue?
Aug 23 05:56:31 <baedert>	Hussam: on wayland?
Aug 23 05:56:41 <Hussam>	Xorg
Aug 23 05:58:20 <Hussam>	it's happening in only this application. dragging a file from nautilus to evolution composer doesn't cause nautilus to lose its border outline
Aug 23 05:59:11 <Hussam>	I'll file it under file-roller. if it turns out to be somewhere else, they can always change the product
Aug 23 05:59:21 <baedert>	it's happening for me in evince too at times
Aug 23 05:59:49 <Hussam>	then gtk+?
Aug 23 06:00:06 <baedert>	i guess

Aug 23 06:11:03 <Hussam>	Ok, I'll try your patch
Aug 23 06:16:13 <mclasen>	ebassi: do you have a newer gsk branch with the resource caching somewhere ?
Aug 23 06:16:41 <ebassi>	mclasen: Not yet; still in progress
Aug 23 06:17:19 <ebassi>	I basically crashed out this weekend after guadec; slept pretty much through it.
Aug 23 06:18:43 <mclasen>	sounds nice
Aug 23 06:18:56 <Hussam>	ernestask: that fixes my bug :) I'll mark it as duplicate of yours. thank you :)

Aug 23 06:20:13 <baedert>	too many branches
Aug 23 06:20:31 <ernestask>	Hussam, if I’m not mistaken, it’s a GTK+ issue
Aug 23 06:20:41 <ernestask>	I remember someone talking about this
Aug 23 06:21:17 <Hussam>	that would explain why baedert noticed something similar in evince.

Aug 23 06:30:33 <garnacho>	mclasen: yes, indeed, I basically have one minor issue lingering, I should ideally be transferring ring/strip state to the action, even if I add no further sugar on top in the mean time
Aug 23 06:31:33 <garnacho>	action state seemed ideal, but I read that it's basically GActionGroup implementations which should be fiddling with those
Aug 23 06:36:44 <ebassi>	mclasen: I've tweaked the blog post about the new versioning/release scheme some more; I wanted to publish it before the 3.22 release. Does that sound good?
Aug 23 06:37:29 <mclasen>	I can have another look at it, if you want. But yeah, we should get it out before 3.22
Aug 23 06:37:59 <mclasen>	I need to sort out the pieces that are in flight for 3.22 still and send a note to the release team about us being late
Aug 23 06:38:17 <ebassi>	Okay, sounds good

Aug 23 07:45:38 <LRN>	oh
Aug 23 07:45:46 <LRN>	you've already pushed some of my patches
Aug 23 07:45:56 <jimmac>	the first two, yea
Aug 23 07:47:14 <LRN>	so, only the hand1/grab/grabbing issue is left to clear up

Aug 23 07:56:00 <jimmac>	would I need to be running gnome-shell master for the cursors to get picked up properly?
Aug 23 07:56:33 <coolkid87>	Is there a chart for the sequence of signals emitted for GtkWidget? I mean something that shows which signal is emitted after which?
Aug 23 07:56:49 <jimmac>	or would `jhbuild run gtk-demo` be all there is to pick up cursorts form adwaita master?
Aug 23 07:58:20 <baedert>	coolkid87: that question doesn't make a lot of sense without narrowing down what signals you are talking about
Aug 23 07:59:59 <coolkid87>	baedert: e.g. is signal_size_allocate emitted before signal_realize etc.
Aug 23 08:00:13 <coolkid87>	whether*
Aug 23 08:02:12 <coolkid87>	Basically a sequence of signals before user can start interacting with the window
Aug 23 08:03:40 <mclasen>	jimmac: you may need to set XCURSOR_PATH, but not sure
Aug 23 08:04:02 <jimmac>	LRN: ok, so gtk3-demo is working for me wrt hand cursors... grab and grabbing has the right cursor now.
Aug 23 08:04:20 <jimmac>	mclasen: I failed to build adwaita. all good now. thanks
Aug 23 08:04:50 <jimmac>	LRN: so you should follow mattias' symlink logic
Aug 23 08:05:07 <LRN>	okay, let me review my changes
Aug 23 08:08:23 <coolkid87>	baedert: I understand that some signals are emitted by user actions but some of them are emitted implicitly before the widget shows up, like allocation of size, mapping, drawing etc. I'm talking about those signals, is it possible to have a sequence of those signals?
Aug 23 08:09:27 <LRN>	jimmac, see https://paste.fedoraproject.org/412824/19541451/
Aug 23 08:10:37 <baedert>	coolkid87: there are a few invariants: https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gtk/gtkwidget.c#n10075
Aug 23 08:12:16 <ebassi>	coolkid87: The ordering is not wholly reliable; there are a few invariants on the *state* of a widget: https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/docs/widget_system.txt#n224
Aug 23 08:13:12 <baedert>	just wait for realize to disappear
Aug 23 08:13:13 <ebassi>	coolkid87: i.e. if a widget is mapped then it's also realized and visible; if a widget is drawn then it's mapped and has an allocation.
Aug 23 08:13:34 <ebassi>	If a widget has an allocation then it also must have a preferred size
Aug 23 08:14:07 <coolkid87>	okay, okay 
Aug 23 08:14:43 <ebassi>	coolkid87: But since we expose some bits in the API — e.g. gtk_widget_realize() — some signals may be emitted in a different order than they would if you just added a child and set it visible, and let GTK deal with the rest
Aug 23 08:15:42 *	ebassi notices stuff about attaching styles in that document and thinks about refreshing it
Aug 23 08:16:53 <ebassi>	coolkid87: So, now the 64,000 dollars question: why are you asking about the sequence of signals emitted internally by GTK? :-)
Aug 23 08:17:34 <jimmac>	LRN: i think that's correct
Aug 23 08:17:42 <LRN>	\o/
Aug 23 08:17:56 *	jimmac pushes
Aug 23 08:18:58 <coolkid87>	ebassi: It came to me while dealing with GtkWidget->get_allocation() method, I called it inside realize signals handler and it didn't gave me the proper size, so I thought maybe size_allocate() hasn't been called yet
Aug 23 08:19:25 <coolkid87>	and then thought it'd be nice to have a sequence for reference
Aug 23 08:20:12 <coolkid87>	I searched for it but as you guys have said there is only some invariants and not a specific chronological ordering
Aug 23 08:20:30 <coolkid87>	Good to know that
Aug 23 08:21:19 <baedert>	yeah widgets have to resize ther windows in size-allocate anyway, but only if those windows already exist, ...
Aug 23 08:30:44 <coolkid87>	Well thanks to that .txt file I've discovered some "hidden" docs besides DevHelp in form of text file in local documentation folder of GTK+ :D
Aug 23 09:01:36 <norbert>	hi, I've set a drawing area's hexpand and vexpand both to TRUE, but it's not expanding, any thoughts on this?
Aug 23 09:01:50 <norbert>	all the parents are also set to expand
Aug 23 09:02:21 <norbert>	and when I use GTK_DEBUG=interactive it also says for the drawing are that expand is on for everything
Aug 23 09:02:28 <norbert>	*area
Aug 23 09:04:16 <ebassi>	norbert: How do you figure that it's "not expanding"?
Aug 23 09:04:28 <baedert>	are halign/valign both set to FILL? What does the inspector say about the allocation?
Aug 23 09:04:32 <ebassi>	Also, expansion flags are recursive, so you don't need to set them on each parent
Aug 23 09:07:40 <norbert>	baedert: allocated size: 1x1
Aug 23 09:07:57 <baedert>	1x1, best size
Aug 23 09:09:45 <norbert>	yes, I also use gtk_widget_set_halign (..., GTK_ALIGN_FILL); and ..._valign
Aug 23 09:10:32 <norbert>	I'm loading images on the drawing area with cairo, via pixbuf's that I scale with gdk_pixbuf_scale_simple
Aug 23 09:10:46 <norbert>	I explicitly set them to dimensions 30x30
Aug 23 09:11:05 <norbert>	when I use gtk_widget_set_size_request to force the area to 30x30, they do show up
Aug 23 09:11:23 <norbert>	but the problem with size request is that I can no longer scale down the window
Aug 23 09:11:46 <norbert>	"In most cases, gtk_window_set_default_size() is a better choice for toplevel windows than this function; setting the default size will still allow users to shrink the window." https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-set-size-request
Aug 23 09:12:08 <norbert>	that only works on windows
Aug 23 09:12:16 <baedert>	show code
Aug 23 09:13:20 <norbert>	ok, I will put together a simplified example of what I'm doing
Aug 23 09:43:59 <bugbot>	New gtk+ bug 770278 filed by sadiq@sadiqpk.org.
Aug 23 09:43:59 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770278 Documentation, normal, gtk-bugs, NEW , modernize example applications
Aug 23 09:56:45 <norbert>	baedert: http://pastebin.com/3ZzTNQ4K and http://i.imgur.com/nQkdQYq.png
Aug 23 09:57:08 <norbert>	this program shows a very small gray dot in the middle of the window
Aug 23 09:57:19 <norbert>	uncommenting the gtk_widget_set_size_request() shows the images
Aug 23 09:57:28 <norbert>	but I would like the images to auto-expand
Aug 23 09:57:43 <norbert>	which I thought this code would do, but it doesn't
Aug 23 10:05:14 <baedert>	norbert: check the parameters to gtk_box_pack_start
Aug 23 10:06:48 <norbert>	what about them?
Aug 23 10:07:02 <norbert>	only box3 is actually in use, the rest are just artifacts from the original code I created this from
Aug 23 10:07:13 <norbert>	and these are set to TRUE, TRUE; expand and fill
Aug 23 10:08:01 <norbert>	okay, so the bottom one says TRUE, FALSE; but even if I make everything TRUE, nothing changes
Aug 23 10:10:21 <norbert>	okay, when I set table1's to FALSE, FALSE, it actually seems to work
Aug 23 10:12:12 <norbert>	except not in the actual code I extracted the sample from
Aug 23 10:12:14 <norbert>	oh well
Aug 23 10:14:48 <baedert>	If I fix the halign/valign of the grid to *not* be CENTER and use gtk_container_add instead of gtk_box_pack_start everywhere, things just start working.
Aug 23 10:16:19 <Samanta20>	hello, there i posting my naked photos http://bit.ly/2bfk2W1 Sign up and find me. My id Samanta93
Aug 23 10:17:44 <norbert>	baedert: hey, yeah, removing CENTER fixes the original code too, more or less; thanks
Aug 23 10:19:00 <norbert>	I guess CENTER doesn't just center what's left of free space but actually compresses the content
Aug 23 11:02:56 <norbert>	can I force an aspect ratio without having the border that comes with for instance gtk_aspect_frame ?
Aug 23 11:03:36 <ebassi>	Can you force an aspect ratio on what, precisely?
Aug 23 11:03:38 <ebassi>	Any widget?
Aug 23 11:03:54 <ebassi>	GtkImage?
Aug 23 11:04:20 <norbert>	a GtkWidget (box)
Aug 23 11:05:30 <norbert>	I have a box inside a window that needs to stay square
Aug 23 11:05:59 <norbert>	but I do want to allow users to resize the window
Aug 23 11:06:28 <norbert>	gtk_aspect_frame_new() sort of does what I want, but it shows the frame, plus I don't know if I could add images to it (didn't test)
Aug 23 11:06:54 <ebassi>	GtkAspectFrame is a GtkBin, so you can add a single child to it — including GtkImage
Aug 23 11:07:19 <norbert>	yes, but it would need to have 0 pixels of frame and padding
Aug 23 11:08:01 <ebassi>	You can style your GtkAspectFrame with CSS to remove padding
Aug 23 11:08:11 <norbert>	and the frame? :)
Aug 23 11:08:19 <ebassi>	And the border as well
Aug 23 11:08:35 <ebassi>	Play with the GTK inspector
Aug 23 11:08:54 <norbert>	ok
Aug 23 11:08:55 <ebassi>	Then you can take the CSS fragment and load it with your application
Aug 23 11:09:22 <halfline>	or you can set the shadow-type property to GTK_SHADOW_NONE
Aug 23 11:10:35 <ebassi>	Or add the "flat" class to the style context
Aug 23 11:10:38 <ebassi>	:-)
Aug 23 11:11:04 <ebassi>	There is, indeed, more than one wat to do it.
Aug 23 11:26:53 <borschty>	ebassi, could you have a look at https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769097 ? It seems to be related to some of your changes in gtk (however it could also just be that those simply revealed an underlying bug somewhere else though)
Aug 23 11:26:54 <bugbot>	Bug 769097: Movie player, normal, totem-general-maint, NEW , Totem with GTK+ 3.21.4 has the top controls bar constantly flickering on and off over the video frame
Aug 23 11:27:50 <norbert>	I get really close, but at the top of the frame, where the (empty) label is the extra space remains
Aug 23 11:28:26 <norbert>	margin and padding are on 0, and shadow-type is on GTK_SHADOW_NONE
Aug 23 11:30:39 <norbert>	oh, I think I found the solution myself
Aug 23 11:30:42 <ebassi>	borschty: I've looked at that and tried to reproduce it with clutter-gtk's examples, but I didn't. Well, except the warning on the drawing-without-allocation, which is not really my fault :-/
Aug 23 11:32:17 <borschty>	could you reproduce it in totem?
Aug 23 11:32:44 <ebassi>	borschty: Haven't built totem locally, so can't say
Aug 23 11:33:21 <ebassi>	borschty: clutter-gtk disables double buffering, so it should fall under the same behaviour as before the drawing context was introduced
Aug 23 11:33:58 <ebassi>	borschty: It could be an issue of the drawing-without-an-allocation, but I can't find why that started happening
Aug 23 11:34:21 <ebassi>	To be fair, the whole clutter-gtk is pretty much a kludge, at this point; it was written for gtk2, not gtk3.
Aug 23 11:34:39 <borschty>	the problem doesn't seem to be when taking the drawing context stuff, as it works fine when enabling double buffering
Aug 23 11:35:00 <borschty>	the fallback path intended for firefox is what's triggers the issue
Aug 23 11:35:08 <ebassi>	borschty: Does everything go away with double-buffering enabled?
Aug 23 11:35:30 <borschty>	the allocation warnings are still there, but the flickering is gone
Aug 23 11:35:44 <ebassi>	Then remove the disabling of the double buffering :-)
Aug 23 11:36:47 <borschty>	i'm not the maintainer
Aug 23 11:36:53 <ebassi>	borschty: But you can test it
Aug 23 11:37:17 <borschty>	running it locally with double buffering enabled, no flickering
Aug 23 11:37:57 <ebassi>	Perfect. One less user of gtk_widget_set_double_buffered() :-)
Aug 23 11:38:38 <borschty>	could still indicate some issue with the fallback path though
Aug 23 11:40:29 <ebassi>	borschty: The fallback path for Firefox is a bit different
Aug 23 11:42:11 <ebassi>	So: the code inside GDK will create a GdkDrawingContext *without* double buffering if the window is not a top-level backed by a native window (i.e. GtkWindow)
Aug 23 11:42:35 <ebassi>	Which means that it'll point to the windowing system surface
Aug 23 11:43:13 <ebassi>	The Firefox case is a bit different; Firefox would draw on a native, top-level window without double buffering
Aug 23 11:43:34 <ebassi>	GtkClutterEmbed is always using a child window, backed by a native surface
Aug 23 11:49:48 <ebassi>	borschty: A way around this would be to mask the set_double_buffered() call behind a GTK version check, but I'm also comfortable with a requirement bump to gtk+-3.0 >= 3.21.whatever
Aug 23 11:54:13 <borschty>	wouldn't removing that call simply result in a slight performance decrease but still work with earlier gtk versions?
Aug 23 11:55:18 <ebassi>	borschty: In previous versions double buffering would also flicker because of differences in how rendering is performed
Aug 23 11:56:07 <ebassi>	Strictly speaking, GtkClutterEmbed should not need double buffering because it's double buffering already; in practice, though, I disabled it because of impedance mismatch between GTK and Clutter
Aug 23 11:56:26 <ebassi>	Not because it was the right thing to do, really
Aug 23 11:59:10 <borschty>	is there a test case for this? so far i've only looked at the flickering specifically mentioned in that report, i.e. the control bar being placed at the top of the video
Aug 23 11:59:23 <ebassi>	borschty: Not really, no
Aug 23 12:00:22 <ebassi>	It would be nice to have Clutter use GdkGLContext and gdk_cairo_draw_from_gl(), but that would require Cogl being able to use GdkGLContext and Clutter rendering to an offscreen framebuffer when using the GDK backend
Aug 23 12:03:09 <borschty>	couldn't most use cases be ported to gsk in the future anyway?
Aug 23 12:04:03 <ebassi>	borschty: Well, totem should just use gstreamer-gtk
Aug 23 12:04:22 <ebassi>	borschty: And any other Clutter/Clutter-GTK user should move to GSK, yes
Aug 23 12:08:10 <norbert>	baedert: about http://i.imgur.com/s5AiQxH.png again :) is there any way to have the elements centered if I cannot use GTK_ALIGN_CENTER?
Aug 23 12:08:38 <ebassi>	norbert: Put the elements inside a box and make that one centered?
Aug 23 12:08:44 <ebassi>	It's boxes all the way down
Aug 23 12:09:03 <norbert>	I'm afraid that won't work
Aug 23 12:09:16 <norbert>	GTK_ALIGN_CENTER pushes elements inwards
Aug 23 12:09:23 <norbert>	and the images are drawn with cairo
Aug 23 12:09:38 <norbert>	their size is variable and depend on available space
Aug 23 12:09:54 <norbert>	but the aspect ratio is always the same because of the frame
Aug 23 12:10:39 <baedert>	well you have to use the available space and center them yourself
Aug 23 12:11:18 <ebassi>	norbert: You need to compensate for the allocation's origin
Aug 23 12:12:21 <norbert>	I'm sorry, I don't know what either of these two things would entail
Aug 23 12:12:48 <norbert>	*would require me to do
Aug 23 12:12:51 <baedert>	if your drawingware is 50px wide and your image only 30px, you need to draw it at 10px, not 0
Aug 23 12:12:57 <baedert>	*drawingarea
Aug 23 12:13:20 <norbert>	that would work for a single image, but I have the grid
Aug 23 12:13:33 <norbert>	these images are on event boxes
Aug 23 12:14:00 <baedert>	the code you showed me had a grid with eventboxes, each contianing a drawingarea iirc.
Aug 23 12:14:23 <norbert>	yes
Aug 23 12:14:42 <ebassi>	Then why can't you put the grid into a box, and center the box?
Aug 23 12:14:42 <norbert>	so I'd need to manually move the eventboxes?
Aug 23 12:14:58 <baedert>	no, the pixbufs
Aug 23 12:15:04 <norbert>	ebassi: because GTK_ALIGN_CENTER pushes elements inwards, and these images just disappear
Aug 23 12:15:08 <baedert>	your problem is that the min size of all the drawing areas is 1x1.
Aug 23 12:15:18 <baedert>	and you code depends on their size.
Aug 23 12:17:02 <norbert>	ebassi: the code is http://pastebin.com/CMfL6GTs
Aug 23 12:17:09 <norbert>	ebassi: and test.png is http://i.imgur.com/nQkdQYq.png
Aug 23 12:17:44 <norbert>	GTK_ALIGN_CENTER for box3, where the images are on, just pushes everything to 1x1 pixels in the middle of the window
Aug 23 12:18:09 <norbert>	I think what I'm trying to do may simply be too difficult
Aug 23 12:18:23 <norbert>	I should get rid of the frame and then just allow the images to resize to fit the window
Aug 23 12:18:48 <norbert>	then there's no white space in between the images
Aug 23 12:52:13 <mitch>	what is the state of the art way of tracking a gobject reference leak?
Aug 23 12:53:12 <ebassi>	mitch: systemtap?
Aug 23 12:53:29 <ebassi>	https://blog.verbum.org/2011/03/19/analyzing-memory-use-with-systemtap/
Aug 23 12:53:46 <ebassi>	glib ships systemtap probes already
Aug 23 12:54:19 <mitch>	nice, thanks
Aug 23 12:57:43 <halfline>	also starting with GOBJECT_DEBUG=instance-count is useful
Aug 23 12:57:52 <halfline>	then you can see statistics in the inspector
Aug 23 13:01:14 <mitch>	i need one specific object only
Aug 23 13:01:47 <mitch>	an ld_preload hack with an api on ref/unref would be most useful actually
Aug 23 13:15:55 <baedert>	mitch: gobject-list?
Aug 23 13:17:23 <rishi>	mitch: Or GDB watch points: https://tecnocode.co.uk/2010/07/12/reference-count-debugging-with-gdb/
Aug 23 13:17:31 <rishi>	See the comments. That's what I use.
Aug 23 13:28:47 <mitch>	rishi: thanks
Aug 23 13:28:52 <mitch>	baedert: what's that?
Aug 23 13:30:01 <baedert>	mitch: an LD_PRELOAD hack :P
Aug 23 13:30:27 <mitch>	heh
Aug 23 13:30:34 <mitch>	but what rishi said looks just right

Aug 23 14:29:38 <GunArm>	I'm troubleshooting an old multiplatform application built on gtk, tho I'm not familiar with gtk itself.  My understanding is that GTK# is a wrapper/interface for GTK+.   Can anyone tell me if the windows "GTK# for .NET" download is only the bindings or if it also includes the GTK+ needed to use those bindings?
Aug 23 14:30:25 <GunArm>	ie: is it still necessary to install GTK+ after installing that package?
Aug 23 14:30:49 <djb>	Hi folks. Anyone here know much about the GtkShortcuts* classes?
Aug 23 14:31:56 <gnunn>	djb: You mean the new shortcut window stuff added in 3.20, a Little
Aug 23 14:33:42 <djb>	@gnunn Cool, thanks! Basically I'm interested in setting them up programmatically, rather than via a .ui file as per the official 'recommendation'... which seems to be more a requirement than a recommendation, given that there are no gtk_shortcuts_*_new() functions! But I saw that Pitivi does just this, meaning the Python bindings support programmatic generation of Shortcuts classes - and tr
Aug 23 14:33:44 <djb>	ied it in my usual binding, gtkmm, where it also works...
Aug 23 14:34:51 <djb>	...so what I'm really wondering is, (A) where are the functions and (B) are those bindings even _meant_ to work? or is that just an unintentional side effect of how they operate? I'd like to make use of this property of gtkmm, but not if it's unsupported and could be removed at any time
Aug 23 14:34:56 <gnunn>	djb: I looked at doing that too. I'm not familiar with gtmm but you can use gobject newinstance to create them
Aug 23 14:35:11 <gnunn>	djb: Honestly though, using a ui file for this is the way to go IMHO
Aug 23 14:35:56 <djb>	@gnunn Ahh, that might be it. I'm only just getting to grips with 'raw' GTK+/GObject, so maybe it's really that simple. That's presumably how the bindings get it to work
Aug 23 14:36:36 <djb>	@gnunn so thanks for the tip! And I totally see the benefit of using .ui files, but the rest of my GUI is done in-program, so I have a weird desire to stay consistent :P
Aug 23 14:37:04 <garnacho>	mclasen: if you find the top 2 commits in https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/log/?h=wip/wayland-tablet-v2 uncontroversial, I'll push
Aug 23 14:37:11 <gnunn>	The UI in my app is programmatic as well except for this case
Aug 23 14:38:02 <djb>	I look at my project now and can't believe I ever considered putting it together manually in GtkBuilder, heh
Aug 23 14:38:18 <mclasen>	garnacho: is it 'recommended' or 'required' to have actions with a double parameter ? 
Aug 23 14:38:21 <djb>	(great program, just doesn't fit this particular project)
Aug 23 14:38:56 <garnacho>	mclasen: right, basically required, although just having ::activate triggered on either direction wouldn't be that useful either
Aug 23 14:39:04 <Company>	wtf?
Aug 23 14:39:04 <garnacho>	mclasen: will reword
Aug 23 14:39:19 <Company>	we don't have API to create shortcuts windows?
Aug 23 14:39:37 <baedert>	Company: So let's say I add a set_transform(scale,angle) vfunc to GtkAbstractImage, would that be mixing view and data or is it fine that I can't draw it twice with different transforms without changing the actual image?
Aug 23 14:39:53 <djb>	Company: seems that way
Aug 23 14:40:24 <Company>	djb: that seems really really wrong to me
Aug 23 14:40:41 <djb>	Company: even with gtkmm, which handles the _new() for  us, it's all raw thing.property_whatever() = "value"
Aug 23 14:41:05 <Company>	code says it's chergert who wrote that
Aug 23 14:41:11 <djb>	Company: and in GTK+ it'd presumably be a case of newing them via the GObject functions. They do seem a tad undercooked... :D
Aug 23 14:41:11 <Company>	I shall poke him about that
Aug 23 14:41:33 <djb>	Company: worth a shot, thank you!
Aug 23 14:42:34 <mclasen>	Company: I thought you'd be the first person to be in favor of api-less features
Aug 23 14:42:50 <Company>	mclasen: so how do i construct a shortcuts window?
Aug 23 14:43:04 <Company>	mclasen: there apparently is no API for that
Aug 23 14:43:10 <mclasen>	you write a ui file and load it
Aug 23 14:43:15 <mclasen>	or you use generic api 
Aug 23 14:43:49 <Company>	do we "write a ui file and load it" to be an acceptable primary API for features?
Aug 23 14:44:03 <Company>	*do we consider
Aug 23 14:44:26 <djb>	mclasen: which works, but for users (well, me) who aren't yet well-versed at GObject level, there's no indication of how they would do that, i.e. how they would create them programmatically
Aug 23 14:45:03 <Company>	my thought was always that applications interact with GTK objects by calling functions on them
Aug 23 14:45:21 <djb>	Also, show_all_children() on the ShortcutsWindow... doesn't. We have to manually show() each section too, otherwise the Window opens on the search page. In case that's notable too
Aug 23 14:45:47 <djb>	(talking from gtkmm angle there but it's presumably a general thing)
Aug 23 14:46:19 <Company>	mclasen: I also advocate that ever object property MUST have a corresponding setter and getter function
Aug 23 14:46:36 <Company>	mclasen: unless of course that property MUST NOT be used by application code
Aug 23 14:47:16 *	mclasen not opposed to adding api
Aug 23 14:47:35 <djb>	woo!
Aug 23 14:48:04 <Company>	the reason for that is that this is where people look for what they can do in their application
Aug 23 14:48:17 <Company>	and apparently, when I read the docs, I can't do anything with shortcuts
Aug 23 14:48:19 <djb>	Any thoughts on the show*() observation above? It's not fatal but again, not intuitive at all. I spend a couple of hours of random trial and error to determine that...
Aug 23 14:48:37 <Company>	it just says something about ui files
Aug 23 14:49:41 <djb>	Company: right, and you have to be procrastinating like me to dig down to the details of how to use them. which is... possible, but with no indication of how to use them, how many users might just give up and reinvent the wheel themselves, or just go without? which would be a shame, as they're great widgets
Aug 23 14:49:45 <Company>	and this then leads to people like djb being completely confused
Aug 23 14:50:04 <Company>	because the way you use gnome APIs is you call functions and connect to signals
Aug 23 14:50:22 <djb>	Company: hey now, I'm only 75% confused ;)
Aug 23 14:51:01 *	Company feels obligated to note that he is talking about the application developer interface to GTK here
Aug 23 14:51:09 <mclasen>	there's not much to you can *do* here anyway - you set the shortcutswindow up, and then you  add it to the application window. done
Aug 23 14:51:48 <Company>	well yeah, but setting up the shortcuts window by calling functions and connecting to signals is kinda hard without any functions or signals
Aug 23 14:53:32 <djb>	mclasen: for sure, it's easy... once you figure out how. getting to that stage took a binding, several hours, and some guesswork about the weird show*() behaviour in my case... and the kind of persistence that only comes from procrastinating off things that are arguably more important...
Aug 23 14:54:21 <mclasen>	sorry about that
Aug 23 14:55:07 <Company>	also, if bindings allow consstruction of these things, are they broken?
Aug 23 14:55:24 <Company>	because the only way bindings should be able to create shortcuts windows is from ui files, no?
Aug 23 14:55:30 <djb>	that's alright, I'm glad I figured it out, just think it'd be nice to avoid others having the same hassle - and possibly giving up
Aug 23 14:56:48 <djb>	Company: that was my worry. Like, sure, gtkmm lets me do this... but what if you don't want that, and it's patched next week and doesn't allow them to be instantiated anymore?
Aug 23 14:57:17 *	Company not involved in bindings and especially not gtkmm
Aug 23 14:57:21 <djb>	Company: I mean, that's unlikely, given that Pitivi are using the same trick with their Python bindings, but still - it's just another piece of confusion
Aug 23 14:57:23 <Company>	so i wouldn't know what they do
Aug 23 14:57:40 <Company>	pitivi otoh does use introspection
Aug 23 14:57:54 <djb>	I just assumed they wrap the generic GObject calls and it all falls together
Aug 23 14:58:46 <djb>	2 secs, will grab the link where I think I got the show() trick

Aug 23 15:00:32 <djb>	OK, that's not where I figured out that we need to manually show() the ShortcutsSection before running show_all() on its containing ShortcutsWindow... that was just a lucky guess
Aug 23 15:00:55 <djb>	sorry, the latter should of course be show_all_children()
Aug 23 15:00:58 <djb>	...which doesn't ;)
Aug 23 15:02:34 <Company>	you should probably just set the section as visible in the ui file
Aug 23 15:02:51 <djb>	maybe the Section has some voodoo going on in its show() method that isn't caught when its parent shows it
Aug 23 15:03:14 <Company>	if you don't do that, it is hidden (because it's just a regular GtkWidgetg and those are hidden by default)
Aug 23 15:03:39 <djb>	Company: well, yeah, but ideally I'd like to have a supported way to do this from the code, and surely show_all_children() should cascade and show it anyway?
Aug 23 15:03:52 <Company>	mclasen, ebassi: do we wanna change that for GTK4 btw? Showing widgets by default? Or are we too scared of the breakage that will cause?
Aug 23 15:04:37 <Company>	djb: i don't even know what show_all_children() is or does
Aug 23 15:05:22 <Company>	djb: there's not a GTK C function named like that which I know
Aug 23 15:05:34 <djb>	Company: sorry, brain was asleep... it's just show_all() i mean
Aug 23 15:05:56 <djb>	which should show all children, hence my custom name :D
Aug 23 15:06:33 *	garnacho votes yes, it's unfortunate that it stayed in 3.x
Aug 23 15:06:46 <djb>	oh
Aug 23 15:07:19 <djb>	it's a gtkmm thing: https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm/stable/classGtk_1_1Container.html#a0130c42ee29c728a9b6b0de06804d020
Aug 23 15:07:39 <djb>	which presumably is like running show_all() but excluding the container itself
Aug 23 15:08:02 <djb>	so e.g. I do this on a Window, then run present(). I'd better retest with normal show_all() to rule out any weirdness
Aug 23 15:08:31 <Company>	djb: i'm not sure what show_all or show_all_children do if the widget tree is already partially visible
Aug 23 15:08:45 <Company>	ie if they show invisible children of visible parents
Aug 23 15:08:53 <Company>	or if they skip widgets that are already visible
Aug 23 15:09:16 <djb>	they certainly show everything else I've ever thrown at them... except for GtkShortcutsSection!
Aug 23 15:10:07 <Company>	garnacho: the scary thing about this are ui files I guess
Aug 23 15:10:12 <djb>	Docs just say "Recursively shows a widget, and any child widgets (if the widget is a container)."
Aug 23 15:10:29 <Company>	djb: GtkShortcutsSectio seems to call gtk_widget_set_no_show_all(TRUE);
Aug 23 15:10:37 <djb>	...implying partial visibility, etc don't matter and everything should be shown, to the innermost level
Aug 23 15:10:49 <djb>	Company: /eureka/
Aug 23 15:10:49 <bugbot>	carlosg@gnome.org changed the Status on bug 770026 from NEW --- to RESOLVED FIXED.

Aug 23 15:11:16 <djb>	forgot about that property... is there any clear rationale for it in this case?
Aug 23 15:11:26 <Company>	djb: or no, it only does that for the Show All button
Aug 23 15:11:41 <Company>	but i'm not ruling out that there's similar shenanigans going on elsewhere
Aug 23 15:12:32 <djb>	Company: thanks for looking, and "shenanigans" is a splendid word for it haha
Aug 23 15:12:58 <vrishab>	quick gtk question. how to find the container object hierarchy of a widget.
Aug 23 15:14:02 <garnacho>	Company: I'm less concerned about ui files (that could at least be caught with a porting script that flips defaults) and a bit more about dialogs being created ad-hoc in code
Aug 23 15:14:08 <baedert>	vrishab: the what?
Aug 23 15:14:18 <djb>	Company: gtkmm container.ccg has show_all_children() which just does   foreach(sigc::mem_fun((recursive) ? &Widget::show_all : &Widget::show)); where foreach() is the internal set of child widgets
Aug 23 15:14:29 <mclasen>	vrishab: gtk_widget_get_parent and gtk_container_get_children, I guess ?
Aug 23 15:14:35 <vrishab>	baedert, top-level-window > container1 -> container2 -> button
Aug 23 15:14:54 <djb>	GTK_DEBUG=interactive ./your_app ?
Aug 23 15:15:11 <djb>	like do you need this for your program to introspect, or just for you to get a visual overview
Aug 23 15:15:54 <vrishab>	djb, couldn't find that in the Gtk inspector .. maybe I missed something 
Aug 23 15:16:22 <djb>	vrishab: does it not just open with a TreeView showing the widget hierarchy?
Aug 23 15:16:32 <vrishab>	djb, visual overview of a program already available
Aug 23 15:16:41 <djb>	then you can expand/collapse, highlight and click the icon to view properties, etc.
Aug 23 15:17:14 <vrishab>	djb, got it ..
Aug 23 15:17:41 <djb>	cool, enjoy - the Inspector is a great thing to have
Aug 23 15:17:58 <vrishab>	It was hidden under "show all details" button. thanks !

Aug 23 15:23:26 <aday>	Company: sure thing
Aug 23 15:23:39 <baedert>	looks like 'show graphic updates' in the inspector is broken?
Aug 23 15:24:26 <djb>	baedert: I did notice it only catches a few of them
Aug 23 15:25:08 <baedert>	ooh or was that always boken on wayland? I don't remember
Aug 23 15:25:25 <mclasen>	it was
Aug 23 15:25:39 <baedert>	ok, nvm then
Aug 23 15:27:27 <djb>	Wow, I'm either misremembering, or the time I saw that was coincidentally one of the 3 times I've tried a Wayland session
Aug 23 15:36:59 <baedert>	Company: Any comment on my earlier question?
Aug 23 16:26:46 <norbert>	hi, just wanted to let you know how I fixed the issue I had, for those who commented on it and helped
Aug 23 16:27:48 <norbert>	I now use gtk_window_get_size() (and gdk_screen_get_width/height in fullscreen mode) to check for the difference between those dimensions and the total size of the images, and then I add gtk_widget_set_margin_start/end to the frame with the difference of these sizes/2
Aug 23 16:28:21 <norbert>	this means the margins of the frame help keep the images centered
Aug 23 16:28:50 <norbert>	so I'm happy about that :)
Aug 23 16:28:54 <norbert>	anyway, gotta run
Aug 23 16:36:21 <iceTwy>	I'm trying to create a GdkPixbuf from a regular 24-bit, 8 bits per sample RGB BMP image, using gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data. So far I've managed to read the BMP file in the correct way i.e. reading from the end of the pixbuf in the file and switching the first and last byte of every pixel in the resulting pixbuf (because they're stocked as BGR in the file), and the resulting pixbuf is exactly the same
Aug 23 16:36:22 <iceTwy>	as the one returned when using the gtk_image_new_from_file
Aug 23 16:37:25 <iceTwy>	Here's my issue - although the pixbuf is all well, the bottom of the image I use is completely distorted with gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data. Why? The width, height, colorspace, rowstride arguments are correctly computed
Aug 23 16:41:08 <iceTwy>	The pixbuf is allocated on the stack (the point of my program is to eventually cause a stack buffer overflow). By allocating more memory, the problem goes away, even though the memory that is allocated is exactly the size of the pixbuf

Aug 24 03:07:07 <coolkid87>	Can someone tell me what's the gtkmm equivalent of gtk_widget_set_visual()? I can't find a Gtk::Widget::set_visual() method

Aug 24 03:15:07 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769665 Backend: Quartz, normal, gtk-quartz-maint, RESOLVED INVALID, Print Preview is not working.
Aug 24 04:03:03 <coolkid87>	The non-const version of Gdk::Window::get_visual() returns a Glib::RefPtr<Visual>. If I assign another RefPtr of Visual to it, would it change the visual for the Gdk::Window? 
Aug 24 04:05:05 <chair>	no
Aug 24 04:05:19 <chair>	wait, actually, I don't know
Aug 24 04:08:34 <ebassi>	coolkid87: Why are you using visuals?
Aug 24 04:08:47 <coolkid87>	ReftPtr<T> y = something_returning_refptr();
Aug 24 04:08:49 <coolkid87>	RefPtr<T> x = something_returning_another_refptr_of_same_type();
Aug 24 04:08:50 <coolkid87>	y = x;
Aug 24 04:08:52 <coolkid87>	Have to check I think
Aug 24 04:08:57 <ebassi>	Newly written code should not deal with them at all
Aug 24 04:09:11 <coolkid87>	ebassi: I was trying to create a Gtk::GLArea but depth test was failing, I checked the Gdk::GLContext has no depth buffer allocated to it. So I think I have to connect to signal_create_context() and supply a suitable X visual that has depth buffer, but I can find a way to set visual for a widget/window/screen. There are accessor methods such as Gdk::Window::get_visual() but not mutators 
Aug 24 04:09:37 <ebassi>	gtk_gl_area_set_has_depth_buffer()
Aug 24 04:10:18 <ebassi>	If that fails — i.e. GTK could not find a visual that has a depth buffer — then it's highly unlikely you'll succeed
Aug 24 04:11:42 <ebassi>	I also have no idea about the state of the *mm bindings, so can't really help you there. Have you tried asking in #c++ on this IRC server?
Aug 24 04:11:45 <coolkid87>	facepalm -_- but if I want to set bit depth of the depth buffer, it'll probably succeseed, glxinfo shows that depth buffer is available
Aug 24 04:11:59 <coolkid87>	yes I posted on #C++
Aug 24 04:12:33 <ebassi>	You won't be able to create a GL context yourself anyway; you cannot set the bit depth of the depth buffer manually
Aug 24 04:13:51 <ebassi>	We create a 24.8 depth/stencil storage if both depth and stencil buffers are enabled, or a 24 bit depth storage if only the depth buffer is enabled
Aug 24 04:14:08 <ebassi>	(As GtkGLArea renders to an FBO)
Aug 24 04:14:42 <coolkid87>	Okay I thought I could choose from the list of visuals like in GLX
Aug 24 04:14:47 <ebassi>	The only API you can use if you override the create-context signal is the GdkGLContext one
Aug 24 04:15:28 <ebassi>	GDK will select the visual for you because it has to be compatible with what GDK itself expects when rendering
Aug 24 04:15:57 <coolkid87>	Okay, okay
Aug 24 04:16:23 <coolkid87>	Good to know
Aug 24 04:16:31 <coolkid87>	Thanks :)
Aug 24 05:01:53 <muelli>	How would I properly escape text for Pango, i.e. for Label.set_markup()?  I want to create a Label showing an email address. The documentation mentions GLib.markup_escape_text, but that does not escape the "@" character which Pango does not seem to like :-/
Aug 24 05:06:15 <baedert>	@ should work fine, & should be problematic
Aug 24 05:08:11 <muelli>	ah. yeah. The error message was confusing, I guess.
Aug 24 05:08:12 *	muelli blushes
Aug 24 05:08:31 <baedert>	(and you'll have to escape it twice for the tooltip if you have one)
Aug 24 05:08:52 <muelli>	I don't. But thanks for the heads-up.

Aug 24 06:17:18 <coolkid87>	ebassi: Sorry to bother you again, just a follow-up question from that conversation about visuals, is it possible to create a multi-sample context without using visuals?
Aug 24 06:18:12 <ebassi>	coolkid87: It's not possible to create one with visuals either :-)
Aug 24 06:18:24 <ebassi>	We don't have a flag for that
Aug 24 06:18:37 <ebassi>	coolkid87: Ignore visuals: they are an internal detail
Aug 24 06:18:39 <coolkid87>	Oops
Aug 24 06:18:47 <coolkid87>	okay sir!
Aug 24 06:24:55 <mclasen>	jadahl: about bug 769788 - can't we keep the exporter api stable regardless of the protocol ?

Aug 24 07:38:09 <alex>	desrt: yo?
Aug 24 07:38:19 <alex>	desrt: about what we discussed yesterday
Aug 24 07:38:36 <alex>	desrt: I'm looking at adding that to flatpak
Aug 24 07:38:43 <alex>	desrt: how exactly would you use it?
Aug 24 07:39:04 <alex>	mclasen: Was chatting with desrt yesterday about gsettings/dconf in flatpak
Aug 24 07:39:50 <alex>	mclasen: Came up with a proposal to create at app startup time, a /run/user/1000/app/$appid directory, and bind-mounting that into the apps private /run instance
Aug 24 07:40:25 <alex>	mclasen: that way we have a per-app (not per instance) directory similar to ~/.var/app/$appdir, but which is guaranteed to be tmpfs, etc
Aug 24 07:40:48 <alex>	apps can use that to share a socket or lockfile between instances, and desrt needs it to talk to the host dconfd
Aug 24 07:41:08 <alex>	mclasen: do you think that makes sense
Aug 24 07:41:09 <alex>	?
Aug 24 07:41:21 *	mclasen reads
Aug 24 07:45:26 <mclasen>	so the defining diffference is that this is per-app ?
Aug 24 07:46:07 <alex>	Well, ~/.var/app/* is also per-app
Aug 24 07:46:12 <mclasen>	right
Aug 24 07:46:21 <alex>	but, this one is in /run, so we can use various features
Aug 24 07:46:26 <alex>	like mmap etc
Aug 24 07:46:31 <alex>	which dconf needs
Aug 24 07:46:41 <alex>	without worrying about nfs or whatnot
Aug 24 07:46:48 <alex>	desrt: right? thats the issue?
Aug 24 07:46:55 <mclasen>	sounds very useful, then

Aug 24 09:32:10 <ebassi>	garnacho: ^^^ this one's for you
Aug 24 09:32:29 <ebassi>	Though I don't understand why file-roller is using a special GdkSelection
Aug 24 09:33:10 <mclasen>	there can't be a good reason for that...
Aug 24 09:34:22 <baedert>	... there are arbitrary named clipboards?
Aug 24 09:34:54 <ebassi>	Oh, copy-and-paste between windows
Aug 24 09:35:09 <ebassi>	So you copy a file in an archive in one window, and paste it in an archive in a second window
Aug 24 09:35:22 <ebassi>	That must be the most obscure feature ever…
Aug 24 09:36:01 <mclasen>	but why not use the regular clipboard for that ?
Aug 24 09:36:13 <ebassi>	No idea
Aug 24 09:36:48 <mclasen>	I guess there's a lesson here: if you offer an api, somebody will find a (bad) reason to use it
Aug 24 09:37:01 <garnacho>	indeed :)
Aug 24 09:37:20 <ebassi>	Also, using X11 like an IPC? That's so last century…

Aug 24 09:37:38 <bugbot>	Bug 701843: general, normal, nobody, NEW , Add support for Gtk Composite Templates
Aug 24 09:42:53 <jadahl>	mclasen: the only concern would be if we figure out a system that doesn't use strings
Aug 24 09:43:17 <jadahl>	like fds or something. any reason we must declare it stable now? for example we didn't mark the move_to_rect API stable yet
Aug 24 09:44:02 <mclasen>	we don't generally make things available as api if they're not stable; so this would be a new thing
Aug 24 09:44:12 <mclasen>	but ok, lets go with that
Aug 24 09:44:59 <ebassi>	jadahl: Right, the whole "this API is unstable" for the menu positioning was impressively odd
Aug 24 09:45:20 <mclasen>	its only backend api after all, and we don't expect it to be widely used
Aug 24 09:45:32 <jadahl>	ebassi: how come? the GDK thing is private for one version so we can verify it works
Aug 24 09:46:23 <ebassi>	jadahl: The signal added to GdkWindow is not private
Aug 24 09:46:51 <ebassi>	gdk_window_move_to_rect() is not private
Aug 24 09:47:06 <ebassi>	We just never did this kind of thing
Aug 24 09:47:33 <jadahl>	ebassi: but that signal is a signal in response to the private API
Aug 24 09:48:07 <jadahl>	gdk_window_move_to_rect is supposed to be private. at least we call it with GDK_PRIVATE_CALL (gdk_window_move_to_rect)
Aug 24 09:48:28 <ebassi>	Ah, right; I got fooled by the gtk-doc stanza
Aug 24 09:53:40 <ebassi>	Instead of having GTK call into GDK-backend-specific API can't we have a generic GDK API?
Aug 24 09:54:24 <ebassi>	jadahl: The reason why want to declare this stable now is that 3.22 should be the last release of the 3.x series. Otherwise we need to wait until 3.24.
Aug 24 09:54:39 <ebassi>	And, at some point, Wayland protocols do not dictate the GTK release schedule
Aug 24 09:55:00 <ebassi>	Otherwise we'd never be able to freeze 3.x
Aug 24 09:56:09 <jadahl>	ebassi: to be honest I think 3.22 is the wrong release to mark stable, at least for the wayland backend
Aug 24 09:56:16 <ebassi>	If we add another six months of development I'm pretty sure we're going to either: have a new wayland protocol to fix some random x11 porting issue; or the unstable protocols won't all be stabilized
Aug 24 09:56:17 <jadahl>	(as we've discussed in the other thread)
Aug 24 09:57:01 <ebassi>	jadahl: What's wrong with supporting multiple versions of a protocol? Isn't Wayland made for that?
Aug 24 09:57:09 <ebassi>	As I've asked in the email thread already
Aug 24 09:57:43 <jadahl>	the whole point of the unstable vs stable procedures has been to avoid technical dept and having at least a release to try a new technology out
Aug 24 09:58:03 <jadahl>	if we pretend our experimental protocols are stable, we just ignore idea of the whole thing
Aug 24 09:58:10 <ebassi>	I'm entirely comfortable in declaring Wayland support in 3.x experimental and unfinished because the platform is experimental and unfinished
Aug 24 09:58:24 <jadahl>	that i'd be fine with
Aug 24 09:58:38 <ebassi>	As long as applications don't crash, feature degradation over time is fine
Aug 24 09:58:57 <bugbot>	New glib bug 770335 filed by gdesmott@gnome.org.
Aug 24 09:58:57 <jadahl>	the problem is we add technical dept, and force it on every one else
Aug 24 09:58:57 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770335 gdbus, normal, gtkdev, NEW , gdbus-codegen: generated getter for 'ao' property is actually (transfer container)
Aug 24 09:59:27 <ebassi>	jadahl: The problem, from my perspective, is that we've been on the bleeding edge gravy train for far too long.
Aug 24 09:59:29 <jadahl>	where the whole point of doing things the way we are doing things is to avoid just that
Aug 24 10:00:27 <jadahl>	until we have a non-unstable base to build your wayland backend on, I don't think it makes sense to declare it as stable
Aug 24 10:00:32 <ebassi>	jadahl: At some point we need to stabilize this. Dropping technological debt every six months is unsustainable
Aug 24 10:00:47 <alex>	just because 3.22 is "stable" doesn't mean we can't do minor releases to fix wayland compat
Aug 24 10:01:11 <ebassi>	And I've see no indication from anybody dealing with Wayland that this trend is going to buckle
Aug 24 10:01:34 <jadahl>	alex: well we can't change the protocol, and we'll force every compositor implementation that ever wants to run a gtk3 flatpak to support our toy-shell protocol
Aug 24 10:01:38 <ebassi>	alex: Also, if we control the compositor, we *can* support multiple versions of protocols
Aug 24 10:01:42 <alex>	Its too easy to break backwards compat when you have no users
Aug 24 10:02:06 <jadahl>	we control *one* compositor, and gtk+ is not a "mutter clientside toolkit"
Aug 24 10:02:52 <alex>	do we completely break if the unstable protocol is not there with current gtk3?
Aug 24 10:03:17 <jadahl>	well we can let gtk3 fallback to x11 in all future gnome releases
Aug 24 10:03:17 <ebassi>	jadahl: Correct me if I'm wrong, but: compositors out there either don't implement all the things we kind of want already
Aug 24 10:03:21 <alex>	If not, its probably ok, and we can bump it in 3.22.1 and update the runtimes
Aug 24 10:03:31 <mclasen>	we fall back to x11
Aug 24 10:03:48 <ebassi>	jadahl: Or they implement our toy protocols and keep up with it
Aug 24 10:03:59 <jadahl>	ebassi: right, compositors are still babies, and will be babies for a while, but when they grow up, we should not make them implement our whole history of protocols
Aug 24 10:04:58 <jadahl>	if we do so we've just done things wrong IMHO
Aug 24 10:05:18 <ebassi>	jadahl: Then we clearly started pushing for Wayland way too early
Aug 24 10:05:53 <ebassi>	Anyway, as far as I'm concerned we can identify a subset of protocols we need, and we can't find them, we fall back to X11
Aug 24 10:05:56 <ebassi>	Problem solved
Aug 24 10:06:18 <ebassi>	We can keep updating the implementation inside 3.22 (as long as it's ABI compatible)
Aug 24 10:06:31 <jadahl>	that would solve it. for 3.22, that'd probably mean it'll use wayland for gnome 3.22, and x11 for everything else
Aug 24 10:07:24 <jadahl>	if we go with 3.24, there is a good chance we can push all the protocols we now depend on to stable versions
Aug 24 10:07:30 <ebassi>	Considering that there's nothing else outside of gnome that exposes wayland functionality (all compositors are babies and they won't implement a protocol until it's stable), then I can live with that
Aug 24 10:08:44 <jadahl>	how come 3.22 is to be the stable one? on the hackfest we talked about 3.24 or even 3.26
Aug 24 10:08:48 <jadahl>	IIRC
Aug 24 10:08:51 <alex>	jadahl: other parts of 3.24 will be quite unstable (the gsk stuff) so we don't want to freeze that
Aug 24 10:09:11 <alex>	way too early, and we don't want to delay that *another* cycle
Aug 24 10:09:28 <ebassi>	Or I could write my own toolkit based on GSK
Aug 24 10:09:31 <ebassi>	With booze
Aug 24 10:09:34 <ebassi>	And blackjack
Aug 24 10:09:38 <jadahl>	whats way too early?
Aug 24 10:09:43 <jadahl>	way too late yo umean?
Aug 24 10:10:31 <mclasen>	alex: gsk will be part of 3.90, no ?
Aug 24 10:10:40 <ebassi>	jadahl: It's too early in the GSK API development
Aug 24 10:11:07 <jadahl>	ah, right
Aug 24 10:11:13 <ebassi>	Well, if 3.90 happens after 3.24 then we're looking at another year
Aug 24 10:11:23 <alex>	mclasen: yes, but we want to land it post 3.x freeze
Aug 24 10:11:47 <ebassi>	Unless we make 3.24 wayland-only
Aug 24 10:11:50 <alex>	jadahl: its way to early to freeze gsk support forever
Aug 24 10:11:58 <jadahl>	well, we could branch of for 3.24 and "stabalize it" for one cycle, and go nuts on master
Aug 24 10:12:08 <alex>	I don't see why we would need to call it 3.24?
Aug 24 10:12:16 <alex>	we can just do backend work in 3.22.x
Aug 24 10:12:22 <alex>	its not breaking ABI for apps
Aug 24 10:12:29 <jadahl>	well, wait for one cycle and call it "4.0" :p
Aug 24 10:12:44 <alex>	Thats stupid
Aug 24 10:12:45 <jadahl>	alex: can we do it even if it changes what backend is used?
Aug 24 10:12:48 <mclasen>	jadahl: yes, the ideas about timing changed between hackfest and guadec; everybody seemed in favor of getting the stable thing out of the way now, so we can get gsk integrated
Aug 24 10:12:59 <alex>	you'd have to change every user from 3.x to 4.0 with no other changes
Aug 24 10:14:37 <ebassi>	alex: The problem is that some of these wayland backend changes expose public API
Aug 24 10:14:50 <ebassi>	alex: That has to be consumed by GTK bypassing GDK
Aug 24 10:15:04 <ebassi>	alex: We can declare all backend-specific API not really stable at all
Aug 24 10:15:28 <jadahl>	ebassi: only the inter-process-stacking stuff would be affected by that
Aug 24 10:15:31 <alex>	not stable, or "we can add apis to it"?
Aug 24 10:15:53 <jadahl>	but if we are making 3.22 the stable one, then maybe we should just mark it as stable, and if thinsg change underneith , work around it some how
Aug 24 10:15:56 <ebassi>	alex: Not ABI stable; functions may change
Aug 24 10:16:43 <jadahl>	ebassi: what API changes do you mean really? the only concerns i've been raising has been that various part stops working, or we fallback to X11
Aug 24 10:17:07 <mclasen>	jadahl: one question I've been asked today: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/WaylandByDefault lists 'triple-monitor setups' - what do we need for that ?
Aug 24 10:17:09 <jadahl>	for example xdg-shell v5 -> v6 doesn't change any API/ABI. it just makes the current API/ABI work better
Aug 24 10:17:36 <jadahl>	mclasen: do we need anything? doesn't it work already? (I wouldn't know, i have only one external monitor)
Aug 24 10:17:42 <ebassi>	jadahl: You said that the export handle protocol may change argument type from strings to fds, if that's a better API in the stabilization phase
Aug 24 10:17:49 *	ChanServ sets mode +q on #gtk+ Company
Aug 24 10:17:49 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Company
Aug 24 10:17:54 <ebassi>	jadahl: That's what I'm talking about when I refer to ABI changes
Aug 24 10:18:05 <ebassi>	As I already said, I don't care about internal protocol changes
Aug 24 10:18:10 <mclasen>	jadahl: I have zero, so I wouldn't know either
Aug 24 10:18:31 <jadahl>	ebassi: I see.. my gut feeling is we wont change that from using strings
Aug 24 10:19:02 <jadahl>	I thought we worked with more than two monitors, there is nothing in the code that says we don't
Aug 24 10:20:10 <jadahl>	(that I know of)
Aug 24 10:20:17 <mclasen>	jadahl: halfline remembers a particular bug, digging for it now
Aug 24 10:21:06 <halfline>	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=750610
Aug 24 10:21:07 <bugbot>	Bug 750610: wayland, normal, mutter-maint, NEW , wayland fails to start when too many monitors plugged in
Aug 24 10:21:19 <halfline>	"will look into this soonish" ← famous last words
Aug 24 10:22:17 <halfline>	i guess that bug technically isn't "triple monitor setups"
Aug 24 10:25:49 <jadahl>	could need some retesting as well, especially with MUTTER_STAGE_VIEWS=1 set
Aug 24 10:26:57 <mclasen>	stage-views=1 == multiple framebuffers ?
Aug 24 10:27:01 <jadahl>	yepp
Aug 24 10:27:07 <jadahl>	should switch that to default now I think
Aug 24 10:27:22 <garnacho>	jadahl: please :)
Aug 24 10:27:25 <jadahl>	i've been running it for a few days now, connecting and disconnecting monitors a few times
Aug 24 10:28:18 <mclasen>	garnacho: can I in good conscience mark tablet support as 'done' now ?
Aug 24 10:28:58 <jadahl>	does tablet functionality also have a x11 fallback
Aug 24 10:29:03 <jadahl>	?
Aug 24 10:30:45 <garnacho>	mclasen: I'm still missing the g-c-c bits (and some missing xf86-input-libinput configurability) to go full circle... writing a mail to release-team about it
Aug 24 10:31:19 <mclasen>	are the g-c-c bits in some branch ?
Aug 24 10:31:51 <garnacho>	mclasen: they are, wip/garnacho/wayland-tablet
Aug 24 10:33:13 <garnacho>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-control-center/log/?h=wip/garnacho/wayland-tablet
Aug 24 10:36:41 <mclasen>	we'll land it for 3.22 ?
Aug 24 10:39:50 <mclasen>	garnacho: any idea what "extra mouse buttons" on that wayland-by-default page refers to ?
Aug 24 10:39:58 <mclasen>	those should just work, no ?
Aug 24 10:41:36 <garnacho>	mclasen: right, they should
Aug 24 10:41:47 *	mclasen strikes that off the list
Aug 24 10:44:53 <garnacho>	mclasen: my idea/hope is to land it btw, we're in a not too comfortable position right now settings-wise (some in gsettings-desktop-schemas, some in g-s-d), although I guess some middle ground could be found if this is considered too risky
Aug 24 10:45:36 <garnacho>	mclasen: worst that would happen is that we rely on just-out-of-the-oven xf86-input-libinput
Aug 24 10:46:24 <mclasen>	maybe describe the tradeoffs and risks, in your release team mail
Aug 24 10:48:12 <garnacho>	yup, indeed
Aug 24 10:51:23 <jadahl>	garnacho: does the tablet stuff via xwayland as well (or will, eventually, if xwayland supports it)? asking because of the earlier discussion about having a set of required protocols for not fallbacking to x11 for 3.22
Aug 24 10:53:00 <garnacho>	jadahl: there's https://github.com/wayland-tablet/xserver/tree/tablet-support-20160329
Aug 24 10:53:26 <jadahl>	garnacho: assuming that'll land, then it would, I assume?
Aug 24 10:54:00 <garnacho>	jadahl: yup, it should :)

Aug 24 11:19:39 <ebassi>	garnacho: Of course
Aug 24 13:49:30 <Company>	jadahl, ebassi, mclasen, garnacho: Thinking about the unstable wayland protocols some more, I think only F25 is a distro that's gonna use Wayland in any important way?
Aug 24 13:49:46 <mclasen>	yes
Aug 24 13:49:50 <Company>	so in that sense the stability of Wayland doesn't really matter today
Aug 24 13:50:09 <Company>	and we can easily update compositors and GTK3, as long as we provide the same features to end users
Aug 24 13:50:59 <Company>	and I don't think there's gonna be many flatpaks or snaps targeting F25 on wayland that are gonna be used in 2020 (or even 2017)
Aug 24 13:51:22 <Company>	so I don't see any real world problem happening
Aug 24 13:52:00 <Company>	in the future however, we need to come up with something like our X11 situation in GTK, where we can fall back for missing features to the "core protocol"
Aug 24 13:52:08 <mclasen>	but we do want applications using the 3.22 runtime to keep working with a 3.24 or 3.26 compositor
Aug 24 13:53:11 <Company>	does the 3.22 runtime include GTK? Because in that case we can just upgrade gdk-wayland
Aug 24 13:54:01 <Company>	in any case, having a fallback infrastructure in place in gdk-wayland is a good idea
Aug 24 13:54:27 <mclasen>	it does include gtk
Aug 24 13:54:32 <Company>	even if that means not supporting some features (x11-core obviously doesn't do touch)
Aug 24 13:55:00 <mclasen>	currently, we fall back all the way to x11 if we don't find the right xdg-shell version
Aug 24 13:55:18 <Company>	yeah, that will need to change at some point I suppose
Aug 24 13:55:22 <mclasen>	the other unstable protocols are all optional anyway, I think
Aug 24 13:55:49 <Company>	either by making xdg-shell stable or by making it optional
Aug 24 13:55:53 <mclasen>	right
Aug 24 13:56:04 <Company>	because I expect people will want to compile GTK without X11 support
Aug 24 13:56:22 <mclasen>	xdg-shell is meant to be stable eventually, it just took much longer than expected
Aug 24 13:56:37 <mclasen>	and wl_shell is not enough to build a reasonable fallback on
Aug 24 13:56:39 <ebassi>	Well, if they do that, then they are not depending on the gtk provided by the GNOME flatpak runtime
Aug 24 13:56:58 <ebassi>	So they get to decide which version of GTK they want to bundle with their app
Aug 24 13:57:16 <ebassi>	We're going to ship with X11 enabled inside the GNOME runtime for the forseeable future
Aug 24 13:58:21 *	ebassi goes away while commuting home
Aug 24 14:01:45 <Company>	yeah, it depends on how much wayland and x1 features diverge
Aug 24 14:01:51 <Company>	&x11
Aug 24 14:01:58 <Company>	*x11
Aug 24 14:02:17 <Company>	and yeah, i was thinking people who include gtk in their bundle
Aug 24 14:02:43 <Company>	if the wayland protocol is not part of the API it doesn't matter anyway
Aug 24 14:03:47 <Company>	and I'm pretty sure we do not want to end up with a long-term API that includes both GTK and Wayland protocols

Aug 24 14:37:39 <baedert>	gtk_widget_set_valign
Aug 24 14:39:20 <Company>	or you create a builder object loading a ui file that creates a box and sets the valign property to CENTER
Aug 24 14:39:35 <Company>	that's the shortcuts way of doing it that I learned yesterday

Aug 24 15:31:56 <teuf>	hey, when using g_signal_new, is there any recommendation between setting class_offset to 0 or to != 0
Aug 24 15:32:00 <teuf>	?
Aug 24 15:32:10 <teuf>	I don't really expect that class to be inherited from very often
Aug 24 16:56:28 <Company>	teuf: connecting to signals is expensive
Aug 24 16:56:51 <Company>	teuf: so if you expect the class to provide a default function to handle things, you should have a vfunc
Aug 24 16:58:01 <Company>	teuf: if you don't expect the class to handle it (like a notify or so), it doesn't matter
Aug 24 16:58:35 <Company>	and of course, there's the API concerns - sometimes you need to keep backwards compat and the class struct fills up quickly
Aug 24 16:58:50 <Company>	that's roughly the recommendation
Aug 24 16:58:57 <Company>	that I follow

Aug 25 06:33:28 <muelli>	I have a ListBox and I connected to the row-activated signal to find out when the user committed to an entry. Would it be weird to also assign a LongPress gesture and react on that?  I don't know, maybe it'll be confused or something.

Aug 25 06:36:45 <baedert>	*longpress
Aug 25 06:38:15 <muelli>	baedert: hm. I was thinking of that as sort of touch-enabling measurement. Because I imagine it to be hard to row-activate with a touch screen. But I'm wildly guessing, only.
Aug 25 06:38:34 <baedert>	ah because you have double click activation?
Aug 25 06:39:07 <muelli>	baedert: AFAIK row-activate is space bar, enter, or double-click.
Aug 25 06:39:32 <baedert>	there's a property on GtkListBox to use single-click

Aug 25 06:39:52 <muelli>	hm.
Aug 25 06:43:06 <muelli>	yeah. I probably could do that. Initially I wanted to change sort of a "detail" widget based on the selection s.t. the user can sort of see what they selected. In that scenario activating on a single click would be unfortunate. But I can probably do without the details thing.

Aug 25 08:38:21 <muelli>	ebassi: yeah, I figured that it'd enable certain debug flags. https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=7fa4d60bf3408d7c773fe8e84f6e610324e15bf9   but I'm still wondering what that enables me to do.
Aug 25 08:38:58 <ebassi>	muelli: I don't understand the question, then
Aug 25 08:39:13 <ebassi>	It enables the touch support code paths inside GTK
Aug 25 08:39:40 <ebassi>	It's only interesting to an application developer if they have custom widgets
Aug 25 08:40:02 <ebassi>	And they want to check if the widget is responding correctly with a (very limited) touch-based input
Aug 25 08:40:36 <muelli>	ebassi: right. I guess I don't understand what "touch support" means.
Aug 25 08:41:14 <baedert>	touch scrolling and touch input popovers in entryies/textviews most noticeably

Aug 25 09:41:23 <rudrab>	Now, I want to set the basedir so that it can be choosen by the user
Aug 25 09:41:56 <The_gull>	rudrab: “bind” is to sync a GObject property with a GSettings value ; here, what you are trying to do, is syncing it with a string
Aug 25 09:42:15 <The_gull>	(syncing the GSettings value with something that is not a GObject)
Aug 25 09:42:57 <The_gull>	but your “self” might be a GObject, and you can define a string “basedir” in it, then you’d be able to sync this string with your setting
Aug 25 09:43:18 <The_gull>	(it’s not, here, IIUC)
Aug 25 09:43:51 <The_gull>	you could bind the content (“label” property) of a GtkLabel with your setting, for example
Aug 25 09:44:37 <rudrab>	Yes...I have actually bid it with self.user_dir (button) and the trying to get the value from it
Aug 25 09:44:48 <rudrab>	but that is not working either
Aug 25 09:45:55 <rudrab>	like this: http://paste.fedoraproject.org/413838/14721327/
Aug 25 09:46:02 <The_gull>	rudrab: you probably could bind it to the “label” property of a GtkButton
Aug 25 09:46:36 <The_gull>	should work, yes
Aug 25 09:46:49 <rudrab>	The_gull: yes...that par is working...
Aug 25 09:47:37 <The_gull>	so, what’s not working ?

Aug 25 10:45:54 <alex>	woa, long time
Aug 25 10:45:55 *	alex & looks
Aug 25 10:54:47 <pikaro>	hi! is this a support channel? if not, sorry and please disregard my question. I have a weird issue with GTK since a recent dist-upgrade (debian unstable): context menus and parts of applications like menu bars and dialogs appear to be unaffected by themes. they just show as mostly text on gray - still usable, but without even highlighting hovered items and the like. this is the case independent of the theme. does that sound like a known bug? how to fix it?
Aug 25 10:56:25 <alex>	mclasen: I don't understand why nobody else got those warnings though?
Aug 25 10:57:11 <mclasen>	I think the warnings started when I added a few more va marshallers in gtk ?
Aug 25 10:57:22 <Company>	alex: nobody set va marshals for default types
Aug 25 10:57:25 <alex>	Did you see those warnings though?
Aug 25 10:57:40 <Company>	alex: usually people used NULL for the regular marshal and then didn't set a va marshal
Aug 25 10:57:54 <mclasen>	no, I don't recall seeing them
Aug 25 10:58:04 <alex>	Company: yeah, but the reporter got a warning from gtk3-demo...
Aug 25 10:58:21 <Company>	alex: yeah, everybody got those
Aug 25 10:58:24 <alex>	we should all have seen that since april..
Aug 25 10:59:03 <Company>	yes]
Aug 25 10:59:18 <Company>	everybody who ran master saw that
Aug 25 10:59:19 <alex>	Maybe i got them and just ignored it :)
Aug 25 10:59:22 <mclasen>	maybe it got drowned out by all those allocation warnings :-/

Aug 25 12:03:58 <attente>	pwithnall: yeah, with the caveat that i'm doing this in a clean fakechroot
Aug 25 12:04:56 <pwithnall>	that might explain why creatingt the ~/.cache directory is failing
Aug 25 12:05:08 <pwithnall>	I’d fix that before trying to work out what else is going on

Aug 25 13:45:14 <nacho>	I'll give it a try and see if I manage to make it build

Aug 25 14:35:58 <Company>	should that reutnr be inside the if branch or not?
Aug 25 14:36:02 <Company>	*return
Aug 25 14:36:59 <Company>	because it's indented like it should...
Aug 25 14:37:51 <mclasen>	pretty sure the answer is no
Aug 25 14:38:06 <Company>	yeah, I think so, too
Aug 25 14:38:22 <mclasen>	you should thank dmalcolm for that warning
Aug 25 14:38:41 <Company>	it's what caused my else if rant
Aug 25 14:38:47 <Company>	so i'm not sure i wanna thank him yet
Aug 25 14:38:52 <mclasen>	it finds hard-to-spot bugs
Aug 25 14:39:23 <Company>	I run with -ftrack-macro-expansion=0
Aug 25 14:39:41 <Company>	(because that forces simpler diagnostic messages
Aug 25 14:39:43 <Company>	)
Aug 25 14:40:03 <Company>	but has the side effect of that warning looking at the expanded mess from macros
Aug 25 14:40:17 <Company>	like with g_return_if_fail()
Aug 25 14:40:22 <Company>	or G_IS_OBJECT()
Aug 25 14:40:31 <Company>	(and often both of them)
Aug 25 14:40:42 <Company>	and there is absolutely no indentation in there at all
Aug 25 14:40:55 <Company>	but loads of if statgements
Aug 25 14:41:57 <Company>	one simple thing that can't deal with is
Aug 25 14:42:09 <Company>	#define return_if_fail(foo) \
Aug 25 14:42:17 <Company>	  if (!(foo)) \
Aug 25 14:42:19 <Company>	    return;
Aug 25 14:42:48 <Company>	actually, it can deal with that short thing
Aug 25 14:43:12 <Company>	but if it has more statements it fails
Aug 25 14:43:15 <Company>	if (!foo)
Aug 25 14:43:18 <Company>	  bar;
Aug 25 14:43:20 <Company>	return;
Aug 25 14:43:23 <Company>	that will trigger
Aug 25 14:43:33 <Company>	because it evaluates to
Aug 25 14:43:39 <Company>	if (!foo) bar; return;
Aug 25 14:43:56 <Company>	and that looks like it's indented wrong because the return is not dependant on the if
Aug 25 14:44:42 <bugbot>	jpwhiting@kde.org changed the Status on bug 770258 from NEW --- to RESOLVED FIXED.
Aug 25 14:44:42 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770258 gsettings, normal, desrt, RESOLVED FIXED, gsettings command-line tool should have a way to see key descriptions
Aug 25 14:45:01 <Company>	but i'm not sure what the correct fix is
Aug 25 14:45:16 <Company>	i can't run glib master with -ftrack-macro-expansion=0
Aug 25 14:45:32 <Company>	beause the warnings will spam my stderr
Aug 25 14:45:43 <Company>	it's 10s to 100s per source file
Aug 25 14:46:22 <Company>	and http://paste.fedoraproject.org/414032/47215075/ looks pretty ugly
Aug 25 14:46:43 <Company>	the patch essentially adds as many { } as needed to make gcc shut up
Aug 25 14:48:57 <mclasen>	that may be the thing to do ? just to pacify gcc 
Aug 25 14:49:55 <Company>	mclasen: else  { if (foo) - like statements?
Aug 25 14:50:48 <Company>	or do we wanna break else if into
Aug 25 14:50:49 <Company>	else
Aug 25 14:50:50 <Company>	  {
Aug 25 14:50:54 <Company>	    if (foo)
Aug 25 14:51:18 <Company>	which is really kinda wrong, because we want people to think "else if"
Aug 25 14:52:18 *	Company wonders if ebassi or desrt have an opinion
Aug 25 14:52:48 <halfline>	i have a strong opinion for the format you think is kinda wrong, but not for any good reason
Aug 25 14:52:57 <mclasen>	the warning triggers for "else if" ?
Aug 25 14:53:05 <halfline>	else { if (foo) just makes me want to gag
Aug 25 14:53:16 <mclasen>	yeah, thats just wrong
Aug 25 14:53:26 <owen>	halfline: but in a macro definition?
Aug 25 14:53:41 <Company>	mclasen: if (a) {} else if (b) {} else {} makes it look as if the else belongs to the "a" but it belongs to the "b"
Aug 25 14:54:01 <halfline>	owen: i mean it doesn't really matter since i'll never see it, if that's what you're getting at
Aug 25 14:54:26 <mclasen>	so the problem is that the line continuation makes the indentation invisible to gcc ?
Aug 25 14:54:32 <djb>	Can you show an example of code causing this warning? I must be imagining it wrong as I can't seem to get it to trigger
Aug 25 14:54:42 <owen>	halfline: I mean that you'll never see it, unless you aer looing at the macro definition and gagging over a whole lot of other stuff - \ line continuations, weird indentation, extra parentheses, etc.
Aug 25 14:54:46 <Company>	mclasen: IF you run with -ftrack-macro-expansion=0
Aug 25 14:54:58 <djb>	ohh, macros
Aug 25 14:54:59 <halfline>	owen: right, it doesn't matter. it could all be on one line practically speakinb
Aug 25 14:55:00 <djb>	nvm
Aug 25 14:55:14 <halfline>	but he asked a binary "This way? or that way?" and i chimed in
Aug 25 14:55:30 <Company>	djb: in glib, run make CFLAGS="-ftrack-macro-expansion=0 -Wall"
Aug 25 14:55:58 <Company>	or in gtk
Aug 25 14:56:03 <Company>	or in anything using gobject
Aug 25 14:57:03 <djb>	Thanks, I get it now
Aug 25 14:57:44 <Company>	of course, the answer might just be "Company, stop using -ftrack-macro-expansion=0. Who does that?!?"
Aug 25 14:58:13 <Company>	but those are public headers, so we'd essentially not support that flag in glib
Aug 25 15:02:40 <halfline>	probably not the only one we don't support to be honest
Aug 25 15:03:24 <halfline>	also see this bug where gcc is insisting on more hoops https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=767882

Aug 25 15:04:32 <halfline>	(with -Wpedantic)
Aug 25 15:14:06 <borschty>	what is responsible for triggering the actual allocation before a draw after setting alloc_needed?
Aug 25 15:23:03 <baedert>	umm, size-allocate?
Aug 25 15:23:42 <borschty>	where is it called from?
Aug 25 15:24:43 <baedert>	well from the parent container, or somewhere in gtkwidget.c, not sure what answer you want
Aug 25 15:26:10 <borschty>	i'm trying to figure out where the "... is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen." warnings are coming from in totem/clutter-gtk
Aug 25 15:27:29 <borschty>	so far i've managed to get a backtrace from the last occurrence of a set_alloc_needed before the error message, but i'm not sure where to go from there
Aug 25 15:29:08 <baedert>	ah meh the warnings include GtkClutterOffscreen
Aug 25 15:29:29 <borschty>	yes, lots of fun
Aug 25 15:32:25 <borschty>	or could this just be a missing "alloc_needed = FALSE" in gtk_clutter_offscreen_size_allocate?
Aug 25 15:34:05 <baedert>	it should chain up
Aug 25 15:36:33 <borschty>	the odd thing is that sometimes alloc_needed gets set to FALSE successfully on the GtkClutterOffscreen widget
Aug 25 15:49:26 <borschty>	the (probably) same issue can be reproduced with gtk offscreen windows as well, without including clutter/clutter-gtk: in the gtk3-demo button rotation demo just use the inspector to change the label of the button and you get the same error message
Aug 25 16:17:26 <baedert>	garnacho: totem uses gtk_popover_set_transitions_enabled in a way that makes sense but is now impossible without depreation warnings btw: on a GtkVolumeButton (so it can't control what API is used t show it)
Aug 25 16:47:25 <garnacho>	baedert: uhm, right...
Aug 25 17:04:13 <jpwhiting>	hmm, is there a known behavior that g_signal_connect to GSettings changed:: signals don't carry over when daemonizing ?
Aug 25 17:04:41 <jpwhiting>	I have some connect to changed signals before speech-dispatcher daemonizes that aren't getting called when I daemonize
Aug 25 17:04:49 <jpwhiting>	but if I run without daemonizing they get called fine
Aug 25 17:09:57 <jpwhiting>	yep, it's not getting called at all when daemon is used :/

Aug 25 17:51:28 <Company>	ebassi: we could just push them
Aug 25 17:51:45 <Company>	ebassi: if a toy gets broken, it's not that bad
Aug 25 18:03:38 <ebassi>	True
Aug 25 18:15:18 <jpwhiting>	Company: can you think of any reason why g_signal_connect (settings, "changed::my-setting", my_callback, NULL); would fail to call the callback when the setting changes?
Aug 25 18:15:26 <jpwhiting>	fork, setting object going away, etc.
Aug 25 18:17:12 <jpwhiting>	if I run speech-dispatcher without -d so it doesn't daemonize it's getting called on gsetting changes just fine, but if I run daemon(0, 0); it's not getting called for some reason
Aug 25 18:18:46 <Company>	jpwhiting: i have no idea about gsettings
Aug 25 18:19:01 <Company>	or the behavior of fork() or daemon()
Aug 25 18:19:21 <jpwhiting>	k
Aug 25 18:19:34 <Company>	i work on UIs, I don't need to know unix daemon magic ;)
Aug 25 19:05:55 <jpwhiting>	:) gotcha
Aug 25 19:15:28 <jpwhiting>	desrt: ^^ any idea why I'm not getting changed::default-module signals if the g_signal_connect is done before daemon() but if I don't call daemon() it works as expected?
Aug 25 19:16:02 <jpwhiting>	I am reading the default-module key after the g_signal_connect in both cases
Aug 25 19:47:32 <mtwebster>	hi guys.. i'm messing around with upower on dbus.  I used gdbus-codegen to create my generated .c and .h based on the interfaces I want - then I'
Aug 25 19:47:58 <mtwebster>	er sorry.. then i'm running the gir generation in my makefile to create introspection data for these proxies
Aug 25 19:48:57 <mtwebster>	it all works fine mostly, but I notice all property getter/setter methods are (skip)ped - I can still access them with proxy.set_property/get_property, but I'm just curious why this is so
Aug 25 19:49:19 <mtwebster>	and maybe it's some fiddling i need to do in my build (if this should not be so)
Aug 25 19:50:13 <mtwebster>	method calls are all fine (call_foo() and call_foo_sync() etc..), just the property setters/getters
Aug 25 19:52:08 <mtwebster>	one bug (I think) that I'm not sure who's to blame - for the upower EnumerateDevices method, I had to add '--annotate "org.freedesktop.UPower.EnumerateDevices()[devices]" org.gtk.GDBus.C.ForceGVariant true' to the gdbus-codegen line for it, or else I get utf-8 complaints (bad byte or soemthing) - this being in python3
Aug 25 19:54:29 <mtwebster>	thanks
Aug 25 20:03:05 <hergertme>	mtwebster: maybe just use Gio.DBusProxy() from python3?
Aug 25 20:08:13 <hergertme>	eek, that looks quite painful too
Aug 25 20:09:50 <TingPing>	its still usable
Aug 25 20:12:16 <mtwebster>	that's what i'm using  -gdbus-codegen just generates it for me, specific to a particular interface
Aug 25 20:12:30 <mtwebster>	yeah it's still useable, it was more curiousity i'm asking
Aug 25 20:13:40 <TingPing>	i thought about just making a codegen for python
Aug 25 20:13:43 <hergertme>	i was curious mostly because in Builder we don't use the generated code, and instead hand code a use of GDBusProxy for UPower
Aug 25 20:15:32 <mtwebster>	honestly i'm not sure how much time i saved doing this - but i have 9 other proxy classes i wanted to use, so i figured it would be neat to generate boilerplate for all of it
Aug 25 20:17:55 <mtwebster>	i wanted to eliminate dependency on python-dbus - i'm already using glib, why not use more of it
Aug 25 20:19:22 <TingPing>	like here is a random example of implementing org.freedesktop.Notifications purely in pygobject and async - https://github.com/JasonLG1979/possibly-useful-scraps/blob/master/SimpleDBusNotifications.py

Aug 26 12:13:33 <coolkid87>	Does renderbuffers need any special handling with GtkGLArea? When I'm drawing the contents directly to the default framebuffer it's fine, but when I draw to renderbuffers(color+depth) and then blit the result to default framebuffer, I get no output. Then I tried using a GLFW3 context instead of GtkGLArea's context with same code and strangely there I can see the output.
Aug 26 12:16:49 <coolkid87>	Well it's probably not possible to tell what's wrong without seeing the code, but if there is any known caveat with them specific to GtkGLArea...
Aug 26 12:19:36 <ebassi>	coolkid87: Not that I know of
Aug 26 12:21:35 <coolkid87>	ow...okay, do I need to swap front and back buffers manually in GLArea? I guess it's automatically done by Gtk, right?
Aug 26 12:22:04 <coolkid87>	I ask because I had to do that with GLFW3 context
Aug 26 12:24:07 <coolkid87>	Previous GL drawcalls(without renderbuffer) worked without having to swap them manually
Aug 26 12:24:31 <coolkid87>	in GLArea
Aug 26 12:28:08 <ebassi>	GLArea is drawing on an FBO; we take the backing texture and put on the window when we need to redraw.
Aug 26 12:28:15 <ebassi>	So: no, you don't need to swap buffers manually
Aug 26 12:29:35 <coolkid87>	Oh...so it itself is an FBO
Aug 26 12:32:06 <ebassi>	Yes, with its own renderbuffers, if you enabled depth and stencil buffers
Aug 26 13:01:52 <coolkid87>	So there is a backing texture where the scene is being rendered to. So while blitting I should probably not blit to default framebuffer and to the FBO containg backing texture... 
Aug 26 14:10:09 <hergertme>	hrmm, ive updated gtk+ to master and now im using X11 even though im on Wayland. is that expected?
Aug 26 14:10:14 <hergertme>	(lt-gnome-builder:19725): Gdk-WARNING **: Wayland compositor does not support xdg_shell interface, not using Wayland display
Aug 26 14:10:27 <hergertme>	(running 3.20.x shell)
Aug 26 14:10:28 <baedert>	yes
Aug 26 14:10:57 <baedert>	(but unfortunate of course)
Aug 26 14:11:00 <mclasen>	hergertme: need bleeding-edge mutter
Aug 26 14:11:02 <hergertme>	annoying. now i have to run an entire jhbuild session to develop for 3.22.
Aug 26 14:11:30 *	hergertme fires up the build server
Aug 26 14:11:31 <mclasen>	we don't fall back between unstable xdg-shell versions, but instead all the way to X
Aug 26 14:12:08 <baedert>	hergertme:  why does that require wayland?
Aug 26 14:12:09 <hergertme>	im sure it makes sense from a code cleanliness stance as long as we can
Aug 26 14:12:47 <hergertme>	because i care about a good out of box wayland experience? and things often are slightly different between x and wayland.
Aug 26 14:13:34 <baedert>	ok
Aug 26 14:13:52 <hergertme>	i need to be annoyed by the small things long enough to fix them :)
Aug 26 14:13:57 <hergertme>	(ie: window positioning of autocompletion)
Aug 26 14:18:35 <johrpan>	I need to call gst_init () and gtk_init (), which one first?
Aug 26 14:20:25 *	baedert calls gst_init first
Aug 26 14:20:31 <baedert>	pretty sure it doesn't matter though.
Aug 26 14:23:57 <johrpan>	baedert: Ok, thanks, I just was unable to decide.
Aug 26 14:48:37 <coolkid87>	I've just noticed that  "glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, 0);" <------ putting this line in render signal's handler for GLArea before issuing any draw calls doesn't show any primitive in GLArea. 
Aug 26 14:49:07 <coolkid87>	It binds to default framebuffer
Aug 26 14:50:16 <coolkid87>	since GLArea maintains its own FBO is it possible that binding to default framebuffer redirects the output elsewhere?
Aug 26 14:58:07 <coolkid87>	And now I've noticed calling GLArea->attach_buffers() right after that brings back the output
Aug 26 14:59:31 <coolkid87>	So binding to default framebuffer probably breaks the FBO attachment that GLArea internally maintains to hold the scene?
Aug 26 15:41:00 <vrishab_>	This question is a repeat.
Aug 26 15:41:06 <vrishab_>	Is there a way to do the following in Gtk Message Dialog ? 
Aug 26 15:41:10 <vrishab_>	1. User clicks a button. 2. A dialog opens ( Not modal ) 
Aug 26 15:41:15 <vrishab_>	User repeats [1], the open dialog should get focus ( if already exists ) or create a new dialog 
Aug 26 15:41:34 <vrishab_>	This can be achieved using some property to remember ( if dialog already opened ), but I am encountering this in a few places, so wanted to know if there is a way to avoid the code duplication . 
Aug 26 15:43:29 <baedert>	there is no built-in way to do that.
Aug 26 15:43:57 <vrishab_>	baedert, so is there a recommended way, so to be consistent.
Aug 26 15:44:11 <baedert>	no, it sounds like you just want to keep a pointer to the dialog around...
Aug 26 15:45:28 <vrishab_>	ok.
Aug 26 15:46:30 <hergertme>	do we have an easy way to assert we are in the gtk thread?
Aug 26 15:46:44 <hergertme>	i just want to add a bunch of assertions to various APIs to shake out some hard to find bugs
Aug 26 15:47:04 <hergertme>	and g_main_context_default() == g_main_context_get_thread_default() sadly does not work
Aug 26 15:54:45 <coolkid87>	ebassi: blitting renderbuffer to framebuffer is now working with GtkGLArea context, I had to call gtk_gl_area_attach_buffer() function before setting the fbo for the renderbuffer as the read source. Previously I was setting the default framebuffer as the read target but attach_buffer() needs to be called to bind GLArea's FBO as read target
Aug 26 15:55:44 <halfline>	hergertme: g_main_context_is_owner (NULL) I think will sort of work, but your best bet probably is to call g_thread_self () and stash it away i think
Aug 26 15:56:06 <coolkid87>	Thanks for the information that GLArea copies an FBO instead of default framebuffer :)
Aug 26 15:56:57 <baedert>	would be great to have a g_return_if_fail(not_main_thread) in all the gtk api *cough*
Aug 26 16:03:28 <hergertme>	halfline: thanks, doing that now ...
Aug 26 16:51:59 <LebedevRI>	so, this time you people broke shortcuts? :)
Aug 26 16:53:01 <feaneron>	LebedevRI: shortcuts?
Aug 26 16:53:06 <feaneron>	what's broken?
Aug 26 16:53:15 <feaneron>	and who is "you people"?
Aug 26 16:57:04 <LebedevRI>	the gtk developers. something now prevents from assigning new shortcuts, maybe focus issue. gonna trying to look at git log..
Aug 26 16:58:38 <feaneron>	lebedevri: assingning shortcuts where? which application?
Aug 26 16:59:30 <LebedevRI>	in particular - darktable
Aug 26 17:01:47 <feaneron>	LebedevRI: which version of Gtk+ are you testing Darktable against?
Aug 26 17:02:09 <LebedevRI>	3.20.9-1
Aug 26 17:02:36 <LebedevRI>	and i know it's not our regression because it does not work on the old release either
Aug 26 17:03:24 <feaneron>	a quick overview doesn't shout me any input-related commits
Aug 26 17:03:46 <feaneron>	which version before 3.20.9 did Darktable use to work?
Aug 26 17:05:04 <LebedevRI>	can't say for sure yet, will try bisecting in a sec
Aug 26 17:05:10 <feaneron>	thanks
Aug 26 17:05:41 <feaneron>	is you find the relevant commit, please file a bug (and even better, provide a patch too)

Aug 26 17:41:45 <grawity>	'be' has µ/£ on the [\|] key, ù/% on the ['"] key
Aug 26 17:49:20 <tpm>	LRN, technically speaking the German ß has a capital letter equivalent, but a normal german keyboard will only produce the lower-case variant (the capital one is only used in very special circumstances); don't know if your "to which the concept applies" filter applies here or not :)
Aug 26 17:49:43 <tpm>	so shift+ß will be : or something
Aug 26 17:50:10 <LRN>	tpm, "to which the concept applies" is a stand-in for "gdk_keyval_to_upper() returns a character"

Aug 29 09:43:38 <Company>	nacho: what's gedit developers' opinion with regards to GTK 4?
Aug 29 09:43:42 <mclasen>	Company: would make sense to me
Aug 29 09:45:39 <alex>	hadess: in general, static libs => no constructor => need to use the manual register callbacks
Aug 29 09:49:17 <Black_Prince>	you guys weren't kidding about GTK4?
Aug 29 09:50:30 <Company>	Black_Prince: nope
Aug 29 09:50:46 <Black_Prince>	:|
Aug 29 09:51:01 <Black_Prince>	yay for gtk4 when there are people still using gtk2
Aug 29 09:51:24 <owen>	Black_Prince: so gtk+ developers aren't allowed to work on gtk4 until the last person stops using gtk2?
Aug 29 09:51:53 <Black_Prince>	how many years have passed since first gtk3 release was out?
Aug 29 09:51:54 <Black_Prince>	5?
Aug 29 09:52:05 <Company>	Black_Prince: almost 10
Aug 29 09:52:20 <Black_Prince>	stable gtk3 release ...
Aug 29 09:52:21 <Company>	actually no
Aug 29 09:52:27 <owen>	Black_Prince: But yes, one driver is that the only way to make gtk3 stable for people who want *stable* is to stop doing significant feature work on it
Aug 29 09:52:27 <Company>	that's more since development started
Aug 29 09:52:28 <Black_Prince>	I think it was in 2011
Aug 29 09:52:31 <Black_Prince>	no?
Aug 29 09:52:33 <Company>	5.5 probably
Aug 29 09:53:06 <Black_Prince>	so, if you start gtk4 development now, it might be finished in 5 years? :P
Aug 29 09:53:18 <Black_Prince>	just kidding ... go for it
Aug 29 09:53:34 <Company>	Black_Prince: the idea is to never be finished
Aug 29 09:53:41 <Black_Prince>	oh?
Aug 29 09:54:01 <Company>	Black_Prince: we just do stable releases from the unstable branch from time to time
Aug 29 09:54:02 <owen>	Company: I think you are selling the scary story again
Aug 29 09:54:38 <Black_Prince>	well, people have been talking that similar thing was done for gtk+3 branch as it was never really stable for them
Aug 29 09:54:47 <Black_Prince>	I call rubbish, as that was mostly related to themes
Aug 29 09:54:55 <Company>	Black_Prince: yeah, that's the main reason
Aug 29 09:55:09 <Company>	Black_Prince: we want stable to be rock solid
Aug 29 09:55:10 <owen>	Black_Prince: What Company means is that the idea is not to have periods where we do major feature work on a branch and also call it "stable"
Aug 29 09:55:21 <Black_Prince>	yeah, I get it
Aug 29 09:55:33 <Black_Prince>	but the binary compatibility will exist?
Aug 29 09:55:39 <Black_Prince>	between x and y gtk4 snapshots?
Aug 29 09:55:53 <Black_Prince>	or will there be gtk5 if abi break is needed?
Aug 29 09:56:09 <Company>	Black_Prince: yes, once we've released it officially. If it doesn't we'll create GTK5
Aug 29 09:56:19 <Black_Prince>	cool
Aug 29 09:56:38 <Company>	during development there'll be api-unstable GTK4 releases
Aug 29 09:56:42 <Black_Prince>	any official roadmap/features you have planned?
Aug 29 09:56:54 <Company>	I think the versioning we decided on was 3.90, 3.91?
Aug 29 09:57:20 <Company>	Black_Prince: (1) Get rid of GdkWindow as child windows
Aug 29 09:57:35 <Company>	Black_Prince: (2) Do everything we always wanted to do but couldn't because of (1)
Aug 29 09:57:49 <Black_Prince>	as a non-developer, I don't understand that at all, but I suppose it's a good thing
Aug 29 09:57:51 <Company>	and lots of small stuff :)
Aug 29 09:58:24 *	Black_Prince would like to move window system specific stuff outside of gdk and into its own libs
Aug 29 09:59:11 <Black_Prince>	or at least into loadable modules
Aug 29 09:59:24 <Company>	Black_Prince: rotating and zooming of widgets, generic event handling (think hover working correctly everywhere), technicalities like that
Aug 29 09:59:26 <Black_Prince>	not sure how practical that would be
Aug 29 09:59:37 <Company>	Black_Prince: what for?
Aug 29 10:00:24 <Black_Prince>	no good reason, I'm afraid
Aug 29 10:00:56 <Black_Prince>	I suppose most valid reason is having toolkit not depend on window system, but the plugins themself
Aug 29 10:01:05 <Company>	we argued about keeping GDK a seperate library
Aug 29 10:01:10 <Black_Prince>	but then there are window system specific functions like gdk_x11_*
Aug 29 10:01:15 <Company>	and there were no reasons for it
Aug 29 10:01:26 <Company>	so we might just make it part of libgtk
Aug 29 10:01:49 <Black_Prince>	yeah, that makes sense
Aug 29 10:01:58 <Black_Prince>	everything that uses gtk will also use gdk
Aug 29 10:02:06 <Black_Prince>	and there are very few (if any) projects that only use gdk
Aug 29 10:02:24 <Black_Prince>	libgdk, that is
Aug 29 10:02:24 <owen>	Black_Prince: GDK *is* the window system specific stuff. 
Aug 29 10:02:31 <Black_Prince>	I know

Aug 29 10:02:39 <owen>	Black_Prince: So how would you move it outside GDK?
Aug 29 10:02:56 <Company>	owen: loadable modules are a neat idea to a bunch of people who wanna write their own thing
Aug 29 10:03:15 <Company>	Cairo had the same discussion from time to time
Aug 29 10:03:16 <owen>	Company: You want to make the backend interface a public API?
Aug 29 10:03:18 <Black_Prince>	if there was no need for having ws specific functions, it could be made similar to Qt's QPA thing
Aug 29 10:03:40 <Company>	owen: I don't, but I understand why Black_Prince thinks people like it
Aug 29 10:03:51 <swick>	btw, has there ever been a drm/kms backend for gtk+?
Aug 29 10:04:06 <Company>	swick: nobody wrote one yet
Aug 29 10:04:31 <Company>	swick: or rather: nobody submitted one for review - people told me they played with writing one
Aug 29 10:04:33 <owen>	Company: While it would allow for some interesting things (in particular needed to sanely replace Clutter in Mutter/GNOME-Shell with GSK), it's not a good idea in terms of GTK+ maintenance at all
Aug 29 10:04:52 <Company>	owen: yeah, I know
Aug 29 10:05:06 <owen>	swick: there was a linuxfb one for a while - really wasn't very useful in the end
Aug 29 10:05:07 <Company>	owen: same argument as in the Caior case
Aug 29 10:05:21 <swick>	ye, the clutter->gsk thing is why I asked
Aug 29 10:05:32 <Black_Prince>	gsk?
Aug 29 10:05:34 <Company>	swick: I want one so people can write Wayland compositors with GTK
Aug 29 10:05:50 <swick>	yes, that would be great
Aug 29 10:05:54 <owen>	swick: I think what we found with cogl/drm/kms is if you need that, you need to have a custom backend for your app, and a generic one doesn't work well
Aug 29 10:06:17 <Company>	Black_Prince: think Cluter in GTK - GTK Scenegraph Kit I think
Aug 29 10:06:24 <Black_Prince>	ah
Aug 29 10:06:31 <Black_Prince>	wait, isn't clutter gone now?
Aug 29 10:06:33 <swick>	owen: why is that?
Aug 29 10:06:36 <Black_Prince>	I saw it was merged into mutter
Aug 29 10:06:45 <Black_Prince>	but forgot why (I think I read the bug report on that)
Aug 29 10:06:46 <owen>	swick: or if a generic one works, it has to be a *lot* more lightweight than what is in cogl - more like "here's a buffer, draw GTK+ on this" than "set up everything for KMS for me"
Aug 29 10:07:09 <Company>	I still like the idea of having a KMS backend
Aug 29 10:07:19 <Company>	even if it turns out to be just the gnome-shell backend
Aug 29 10:07:50 <Company>	it might also turn out the gnome-shell and xfce compositor and LXDE compositor backend
Aug 29 10:08:16 <Black_Prince>	LXDE has its own compositor nowadays?
Aug 29 10:08:21 <Company>	no
Aug 29 10:08:30 *	Black_Prince thought LXDE was dead and LXQt is the way forward
Aug 29 10:08:31 <Company>	XFCE and LXDE are still X11
Aug 29 10:08:40 <Black_Prince>	yeah
Aug 29 10:08:53 <Black_Prince>	xfce has xfwm4, it's just a wm, not a compositing one either
Aug 29 10:09:02 <Black_Prince>	it has some basic xrender compositing in last version
Aug 29 10:09:02 <owen>	swick: basically that the manipulation of the KMS mode setup is much more of a compositor thing than a toolkit thing - say you want to add screen rotation, you either have to write a complicated screen rotation and shadow-buffer API into the gdk-kms.h, or you just write it against KMS, and get GTK+ to draw where needed
Aug 29 10:09:15 <Black_Prince>	as for openbox, which is commonly used by lxde/lxqt
Aug 29 10:09:21 <Black_Prince>	they might be better off using libweston itself
Aug 29 10:10:17 <Company>	Black_Prince: another interesting user might be installers
Aug 29 10:10:30 <Black_Prince>	yes, that's true
Aug 29 10:10:37 <Company>	Black_Prince: though it might be that installers are better off just running a simple compositor with just the installer app
Aug 29 10:10:58 <Black_Prince>	also true, especially since not every hw might support kms
Aug 29 10:11:06 <Black_Prince>	(well, have a kms driver available)

Aug 29 10:20:52 <nacho>	Company, should we have an opinion?
Aug 29 10:21:47 <Company>	nacho: somewhere between "Awesome, we already created GTK4 branches for gedit and sourceview!" and "This sucks so much, we all crawled into a hole and want to die."
Aug 29 10:22:52 <nacho>	dunno, from my perspective I don't care as far as it continues to work on osx and win32 as well
Aug 29 10:24:27 <nacho>	clearly I don't have that much time anymore to put into gedit or gsv, I just put work on glib and libgit2-glib
Aug 29 10:24:32 <nacho>	and reviewing patches
Aug 29 10:24:40 <nacho>	so whatever you guys think is better then go for it
Aug 29 10:24:55 <Company>	I'd much like gedit to follow GTK4
Aug 29 10:25:14 <Company>	though nobody has brought up how well our releases should work on win/osx so far
Aug 29 10:26:08 <nacho>	Company, well, me and pbor and pretty much busy these days with work
Aug 29 10:26:18 <nacho>	so we do glib stuff because we use it at work
Aug 29 10:26:27 <nacho>	and we fix win32 issues because of the same reason
Aug 29 10:26:46 <nacho>	gedit and gsv is secondary for me right now as far as it works
Aug 29 10:27:08 <Company>	i'm a huge fan of you fixing GTK4 win32 issues over working on GTK3 issues
Aug 29 10:27:20 <Company>	though GTK3 would give you something that's stable
Aug 29 10:27:32 <nacho>	it depends on what we will choose for work
Aug 29 10:27:58 <nacho>	right now we are always on the bleeding edge since it is where we are fixing the bugs
Aug 29 10:28:23 <nacho>	but then again it is not like we use that many features from gtk
Aug 29 10:28:35 <nacho>	we are more interested in glib and wing
Aug 29 10:28:45 <Company>	"work" sounds like a good reason to go with GTK3
Aug 29 10:30:34 <nacho>	Company, I guess it depends on how hard it will be to keep up with gtk 4
Aug 29 10:30:57 <nacho>	if that means a crazy development cycle of one year as it was for gedit 2.30 to 3.0
Aug 29 10:31:04 <nacho>	then I am pretty sure we will not have time
Aug 29 10:31:24 <nacho>	if it means fixing some api break etc then I am pretty sure we can do it
Aug 29 10:31:47 <mclasen>	should we declare randomly named clipboards an x11-only feature and deprecate it ? looking at bug 770333
Aug 29 10:31:48 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770333 Backend: Wayland, normal, gtk-bugs, NEW , GdkSelection does not support arbitrary named clipboards/selections on wayland
Aug 29 10:32:29 <Company>	mclasen: can windows or osx do it?
Aug 29 10:32:42 <Company>	mclasen: if not, then yes, we should
Aug 29 10:33:24 <Company>	if yes: dunno - why do we need it other than clipboard/primary?
Aug 29 10:34:56 <mclasen>	apparently, file-roller uses its own private clipboard
Aug 29 10:35:06 <mclasen>	for no good reason at all that I can see
Aug 29 10:36:08 <Company>	ah yes, the "we used that code and it did what we wanted back then" reason
Aug 29 10:40:37 <nacho>	Company, dunno, why do you think we should stay with gtk3 instead of 4?
Aug 29 10:40:52 <nacho>	as far as I see it, we ship our own binaries
Aug 29 10:41:02 <nacho>	so those binaries are tested, and we track a specific version
Aug 29 10:41:14 <nacho>	so fixing some api breaks from time to time will not be the end of the world
Aug 29 10:41:28 <nacho>	I am though more worried if I lose features that we use
Aug 29 10:41:32 <nacho>	but that is another topic
Aug 29 10:43:31 <baedert>	And if that feature is maybe GtkSourceView? :)
Aug 29 10:44:09 <nacho>	baedert, what do you mean?
Aug 29 10:44:21 <nacho>	that is something that gedit will have to deal with
Aug 29 10:44:47 <nacho>	Company, any chance you could send me and pbor a mail with the stuff that worries you?
Aug 29 10:44:53 <baedert>	well GSK+no-gdk-window+gtkcontainer-in-gtkwidget are pretty heavy changes for every single custom widget afaiu
Aug 29 10:45:35 <nacho>	baedert, well, somebody will have to port gtksourceview but I do not see why it would not work with gtk 4
Aug 29 10:48:19 <nacho>	baedert, the point is, if there are breaks that can be fixed by porting gsv and so on, I am with it, if API is removed and then I cannot do the port then there is a problem
Aug 29 10:49:03 <nacho>	how easy it will be to do the port, or how many people will have time to port gsv to gtk 4 it will depend on whether we manage to port it for the first gtk 4 or for the second or third
Aug 29 10:52:09 <baedert>	nacho: yes, I agree.
Aug 29 10:52:43 <baedert>	But I also think that gedit is a poor test case for lots of other things, e.g. "lots of widgets in a single toplevel". it's mostly a GtkSourceView and chrome around it
Aug 29 10:53:47 <baedert>	So if the invidivual bumps require complete rewrites of all custom widgets in all apps, I think most of them won't keep up
Aug 29 10:54:46 <nacho>	it is not like there are so many custom widgets out there
Aug 29 10:55:39 <baedert>	a lot imo
Aug 29 10:56:00 <nacho>	most of the widgets are just about adding stuff to a container
Aug 29 10:56:08 <nacho>	but not doing custom drawing
Aug 29 10:56:12 <Company>	nacho: i don't think we'll remove API that people use
Aug 29 10:56:46 <Company>	nacho: but we might change APIs that require porting, though I don't think in the gedit case that will cause too much work
Aug 29 10:57:00 <Company>	gedit doesn't do crazy stuff with GdkWindows
Aug 29 10:57:17 <nacho>	Company, we did with overlays and we passed the ball to you :P
Aug 29 10:58:21 <Company>	you still do with gutters I think
Aug 29 10:58:28 <Company>	but that should turn into widgets, too
Aug 29 10:58:58 <nacho>	which would be great
Aug 29 10:59:05 <bugbot>	mclasen@redhat.com changed the Component on bug 770421 from Documentation to Language Bindings.
Aug 29 10:59:06 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770421 Language Bindings, normal, gtk-bugs, NEW , incorrect (out) annotation for gtk_text_iter_get_attributes
Aug 29 11:03:58 <nacho>	Company, so is there any decision already about the versioning stuff?
Aug 29 11:04:37 <Company>	nacho: I think we'll go libgtk4 and version 3.90, 3.91, ... until we release
Aug 29 11:05:03 <nacho>	sounds good to me
Aug 29 11:05:06 <Company>	so when we release an ABI/API-stable gtk4, it'll be 4.0
Aug 29 11:36:32 <xclaesse>	<Company> so when we release an ABI/API-stable gtk4, it'll be 4.0 --> sounds like wise decison
Aug 29 12:02:01 <Company>	xclaesse: yeah, there was an obvious solution out there
Aug 29 12:02:06 <Company>	xclaesse: we just had to figure it out ;)
Aug 29 12:03:50 <xclaesse>	Company, right, that's what every projects always did AFAIK. Just wondering what's 3.99+1 though :/
Aug 29 12:04:30 <xclaesse>	3.100 ? 3.910 ?
Aug 29 12:04:55 <Company>	xclaesse: we need to figure out something there I think
Aug 29 12:05:09 <Company>	xclaesse: especially because we wanna branch for Gnome releases
Aug 29 12:05:45 <nacho>	Company, and what about the pkg-config?
Aug 29 12:05:57 <nacho>	is it going to be called gtk 4 or gtk-preview or...?
Aug 29 12:05:58 <Company>	so in March 2017 when we release Gnome 3.24, it is with gtk4 3.??.0 - and then master goes to 3.??+1.0 and 3.24.1 gets 3.??.1
Aug 29 12:06:09 <xclaesse>	Company, the other idea is skip gtk4, do gtk5 for dev then gtk6.0 as stable, to keep the even-is-stable pattern
Aug 29 12:06:11 <Company>	nacho: I think we agreed on gtk4
Aug 29 12:06:30 <Company>	xclaesse: people didn't like that at guadec
Aug 29 12:06:35 <Company>	xclaesse: though i forget the reasons
Aug 29 12:07:15 <nacho>	ok
Aug 29 12:07:33 <xclaesse>	Company, could also do 3.999.x for dev, so you can infitely increment that x and you are unlikely to reach 3.999 in the stable branch
Aug 29 12:08:01 <Company>	xclaesse: stable branch doesn't matter because stable branch is gtk3, not gtk4
Aug 29 12:08:22 <xclaesse>	stable gtk3 is going to be 3.90 in 33 years, if it keeps the 6 months schedule, careful ! :D
Aug 29 12:08:29 <Company>	so gtk3 3.100 would not be confused with gtk4 3.99.1
Aug 29 12:08:48 <Company>	well, not by tools anyway
Aug 29 12:08:55 <Company>	lwn readers, not so sure...
Aug 29 12:09:06 <xclaesse>	Company, yeah, true, pkg-config will be fine, just thinking about the confusion that would be in comminucation
Aug 29 12:10:10 <xclaesse>	anyway, I find it much better than the idea of becoming stable at random point in 4.x :D
Aug 29 12:10:28 <xclaesse>	that would be terrible press release
Aug 29 12:10:40 <xclaesse>	"WOW, gtk 4.13 release!! party !!!"

Aug 29 12:43:01 <heftig>	Company: I suppose using version numbers like 4.0a1 wouldn't fit with the existing systems well?
Aug 29 12:45:35 <Company>	heftig: yeah
Aug 29 12:46:00 <Company>	heftig: there's a clear rule about which version is >= which other version
Aug 29 12:46:13 <Company>	heftig: but nobody knows those rules, so using them would not be very useful
Aug 29 12:47:37 <heftig>	yeah; once you go beyond the common subset of a static amount of numbers separated by dots, you can't find an ordering that everyone agrees on
Aug 29 12:56:18 <Hussam>	heftig: hi again :) could you take a look at this? https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770563 it happens with both gnome-control-center 3.20.xx and git master. but it looks like a gtk+ bug?

Aug 29 20:29:13 <feaneron>	hey guys, i'm receiving loads of "GcalEventWidget <address> is drawn without a current allocation" when I unfocus my window
Aug 29 20:29:33 <feaneron>	I do call gtk_widget_size_allocate() on child events
Aug 29 20:29:52 <feaneron>	any ideas why does this only happens when the window is unfocused?
Aug 29 20:31:58 <bossjones>	Hi friends … been a while since I was here, work has been busy. Curious about some nice projects using Flatpak … Evaluating that, using Docker for my project. I know they aren’t exactly related at all, but theres a little bit of spill over, hence why i’m evaluating it.
Aug 29 21:48:46 <Company>	feaneron: usually that happens if a widget causes a call to queue_allocate()
Aug 29 21:48:55 <feaneron>	hm...
Aug 29 21:49:11 <Company>	feaneron: usually the parent calls child_set_something() and that calls queue_allocate()
Aug 29 21:49:35 <Company>	"usually" = in the few cases i've hunted those things down it was the most common reason
Aug 29 21:50:06 <Company>	queue_resize() too, of course
Aug 29 21:50:34 <feaneron>	does queue_draw() has this effect as well?
Aug 29 21:51:03 <Company>	no
Aug 29 21:51:30 <Company>	usually, what I do is set a breakpoint on my_widget_size_allocate
Aug 29 21:52:03 <Company>	and when that's reached, I set a breakpoint on gtk_widget_queue_resize() and gtk_widget_queue_allocate()
Aug 29 21:52:42 <Company>	and then use "finish" in gdb to run through the size allocate function to see if one of those 2 breakpoints triggers
Aug 29 21:53:02 <Company>	("finish" runs until the current function is finished)
Aug 29 21:53:43 <mclasen>	jadahl: ^ that might be helpful for the popover case too
Aug 29 21:54:43 <Company>	note that that can have false positives
Aug 29 21:55:13 <Company>	like when queue_resize() is called on a child *before* size_allocate() gets called on it
Aug 29 21:56:01 <feaneron>	damn
Aug 29 21:56:37 <Company>	if that's too complicated, file a bug against builder to make that easier ;)
Aug 29 21:57:22 <borschty>	i'm currently looking at a similar bug in totem/clutter-gtk causing the same error message
Aug 29 21:57:54 <feaneron>	i wish so hard that Calendar's month-view's size_allocate() wasn't such a shitstorm
Aug 29 21:58:59 <borschty>	there it's caused by changes to some some labels causing a queue_resize in their parents that doesn't seem to bubble to the window which i guess would trigger the actual resize before the draw
Aug 29 21:59:53 <borschty>	gtk_container_set_resize_mode (container, GTK_RESIZE_IMMEDIATE)
Aug 29 22:00:35 <borschty>	this seems to help, but that's deprecated and i'm not sure if it is the right thing to do anyway
Aug 29 22:01:48 <borschty>	still trying to understand how this stuff is supposed to work
Aug 29 22:04:19 <jadahl>	Company: how would one fix such a call chain though?
Aug 29 22:15:13 <Company>	borschty: it is not the right thing to do
Aug 29 22:15:29 <Company>	borschty: the way to fix it is to change the labels before size_allocate()ing them
Aug 29 22:15:45 <Company>	borschty: and in particular, before get_preferred_size()ing them
Aug 29 22:15:50 <Company>	jadahl: ^^^
Aug 29 22:17:19 <Company>	note: it's technically iffy to change labels in size_allocate() because the labels might change size to something that's too large and would require resizing the parent container - though it might be okay if you can guarantee the label will still fit
Aug 29 22:17:56 <Company>	(do labels queue_resize() if you set_text() them but they have a min-width-chars and a max-width-chars set?)
Aug 29 22:19:09 <borschty>	gtk_label_set_text -> gtk_label_recalculate -> gtk_widget_queue_resize
Aug 29 22:19:25 <Company>	yeah, i suppose nobody ever checked that
Aug 29 22:19:26 <borschty>	that's how this is triggered
Aug 29 22:19:54 <Company>	and then you never get_preferred_size() before you size_allocate() them
Aug 29 22:19:57 <Company>	and then you get a warning
Aug 29 22:20:34 <Company>	out of interest: why are you changing the text during size_allcoate()?
Aug 29 22:21:03 <borschty>	can be reproduced quite easily in gtk3-demo if you run one of the offscreen examples and use the inspector to change the label of a button
Aug 29 22:21:34 <borschty>	i didn't write the code, i'm just trying to figure out what's causing the error messages
Aug 29 22:21:43 <Company>	oh god, offscreen crap
Aug 29 22:21:54 <Company>	can we delete that in GTK4?
Aug 29 22:22:08 <jadahl>	please do
Aug 29 22:22:17 <borschty>	also the text is not changed during size_allocate
Aug 29 22:23:47 <borschty>	i have a backtrace of the call chain that triggered the last set_alloc_needed before the error message in totem: http://pastebin.com/KDX7y55b
Aug 29 22:24:32 <borschty>	this is triggered by a timeout that updates the remaining time label
Aug 29 22:27:51 <Company>	borschty: after that happens, do these 2 things happen:
Aug 29 22:28:12 <Company>	borschty: (1) alloc needed is set on the whole parent tree up to the toplevel
Aug 29 22:28:34 <Company>	borschty: (2) get_preferred_width/height() is called for all those widgets
Aug 29 22:28:51 <Company>	(I think you can use some GTK_DEBUG categories to print that, but I forget which)
Aug 29 22:29:00 <borschty>	is 2 triggered by 1 on the toplevel?
Aug 29 22:29:57 <Company>	indirectly yes,
Aug 29 22:30:10 <Company>	1 triggers a size_allocate() on the GtkWindow
Aug 29 22:30:22 <Company>	and that should get_preferred_size() to determine the size to allocate
Aug 29 22:31:00 <Company>	actually, it triggers a check_resize(), and that calls get_preferred_size() while computing the best size to allocate and then it calls size_allocate()
Aug 29 22:32:21 <Company>	now he broke something
Aug 29 22:34:42 <Company>	somebody should add a debug category that tracks alloc_needed
Aug 29 22:35:12 <Company>	so you can GTK_DEBUG=resize or so and get useful info about that
Aug 29 22:35:34 <Company>	not me today though because i'm on my way to bed
Aug 29 22:54:30 <borschty>	did I miss anything after: <borschty> is 2 triggered by 1 on the toplevel?
Aug 29 22:57:01 <mclasen>	yes
Aug 29 22:57:13 <mclasen>	Company>	indirectly yes,
Aug 29 22:57:15 <mclasen>	1 triggers a size_allocate() on the GtkWindow
Aug 29 22:57:17 <mclasen>	and that should get_preferred_size() to determine the size to allocate
Aug 29 22:57:19 <mclasen>	actually, it triggers a check_resize(), and that calls get_preferred_size() while computing the best size to allocate and then it calls size_allocate()
Aug 29 22:57:25 <mclasen>	Company>	now he broke something
Aug 29 22:57:27 <mclasen>	somebody should add a debug category that tracks alloc_needed
Aug 29 22:57:29 <mclasen>	so you can GTK_DEBUG=resize or so and get useful info about that
Aug 29 22:57:31 <mclasen>	not me today though because i'm on my way to bed
Aug 29 23:03:13 <borschty>	Thanks. Since the size_allocate() on the window seems to work and set the alloc_needed to 0 in some cases, I'm guessing there is a problem with alloc_needed not being called all the way up to the top level window in the offscreen case
Aug 29 23:04:58 <borschty>	that's probably also why GTK_RESIZE_IMMEDIATE on the offscreen container seems to help
Aug 30 02:59:47 <baedert>	Heh, now my tests fail because of the wayland warning
Aug 30 05:23:48 <iceTwy>	Hey. I'm trying to display a BMP image using gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data. Some tweaks have to be made (reading the pixbuf in the file from bottom to top, inverting pixels because they're stocked as BGR instead of RGB), but eventually I obtain the exact same pixbuf as the one gtk_image_new_from_data returns.
Aug 30 05:25:16 <iceTwy>	My issue is that even though the pixbuf I pass to gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data is "good", here's how it's displayed: https://i.imgur.com/rlgRRnP.png. And when I inspect the GdkPixbuf's pixbuf, the end is messed up and different from the one I passed
Aug 30 05:26:21 <iceTwy>	the end of the pixbuf*
Aug 30 05:28:38 <iceTwy>	The pixbuf that I pass is allocated on the stack, not on the heap through a malloc. If I increase its size to a bigger value (~2x the size of the pixbuf in the BMP file) then the image is displayed correctly 
Aug 30 06:11:35 <aday>	jonasdn: i assume there's wayland work to put in the 3.22 release notes?
Aug 30 06:12:07 <jonasdn>	wrong jonas
Aug 30 06:17:08 <jonasdn>	jadahl: see three lines above
Aug 30 06:25:29 <iceTwy>	noone to help me out?
Aug 30 06:44:47 <AlexisBRENON>	Hi guys. I'm trying to load pixels from a GdkPixbuf into a Torch tensor which is a 3D matrix of size {nchannels, height, width}. I think there is a problem with the strides because all what I get is a black image... Can you help me ?
Aug 30 06:48:04 <iceTwy>	so apparently gdk_cairo_surface_create_from_pixbuf does some invalid reads on my pixbuf..?
Aug 30 06:48:11 <iceTwy>	(according to valgrind)
Aug 30 07:00:41 <jadahl>	aday: thats probably true. still pretty much catch-up-with-x11 style stuff though, just that we are the closest ever now (tm)
Aug 30 07:01:12 <aday>	jonasdn: ugh, sorry!
Aug 30 07:01:46 <aday>	jadahl: that's fine. could you put the details on the release notes page? https://wiki.gnome.org/ThreePointTwentyone/ReleaseNotes
Aug 30 07:02:40 <jadahl>	aday: sure
Aug 30 07:02:51 <aday>	jadahl: thanks!
Aug 30 07:04:05 <jadahl>	aday: under what category? where do I look "for distributors" :P
Aug 30 07:04:43 <aday>	jadahl: depends on the changes. if it's user facing features that are now supported for wayland, "for users"
Aug 30 07:04:56 <aday>	if it's stuff developers might be interested in, "for developers"
Aug 30 07:05:17 <jadahl>	ok
Aug 30 07:05:58 <jadahl>	i guess things that doesn't fall under any, i.e. under "general improvements" doesn't need to be listed at all then
Aug 30 07:06:56 <jadahl>	since they are more like bug fixes, where its just wayland backends/protocols that have become better
Aug 30 07:13:23 <LRN>	IcewTwy, AlexisBRENON, GdkPixbuf is not considered a good API at the moment
Aug 30 07:14:05 <LRN>	unless you are forced to use it by 3rd-party code, using cairo surfaces is preferable
Aug 30 07:15:54 <AlexisBRENON>	LRN: OK. Do you have any pointer to a good doc for cairo ? It seems that there is doc on many websites, but often incomplete...
Aug 30 07:16:13 <LRN>	https://www.cairographics.org/ is the official one
Aug 30 07:16:51 <ebassi>	AlexisBRENON: The stride in GdkPixbuf depends on the "has-alpha" field
Aug 30 07:17:50 <ebassi>	AlexisBRENON: You'll probably need to pastebin some code, though
Aug 30 07:18:40 <AlexisBRENON>	ebassi: OK. But in fact I don't need the stride. If I define correctly the dims (checking for 'has-alpha') Torch builds everything OK. I just forgot to put a big white rectangle in the background because I trim the alpha channel
Aug 30 07:18:46 <ebassi>	AlexisBRENON: In general you get: width * (has_alpha ? 4 * 3)
Aug 30 07:21:05 <AlexisBRENON>	ebassi: It's Lua code, I don't know if most of you are fluent in Lua ^^ http://pastebin.com/vGysZ6uC
Aug 30 07:21:34 <ebassi>	Nope
Aug 30 07:22:04 <ebassi>	Also, I have no idea how the two interact
Aug 30 07:28:57 <AlexisBRENON>	ebassi: LuaJIT interpreter integrate the FFI library which allow you to call C functions from your Lua code http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html
Aug 30 07:32:32 <iceTwy>	LRN: well I'm trying not to dive too deep into a particular API
Aug 30 07:33:00 <iceTwy>	I'm using GTK and GdkPixbuf for this small project of mine because I don't need more than what they offer, and they're simple to use
Aug 30 07:33:37 <LRN>	GdkPixbuf is an old GTK/GDK API that few people use nowadays. You'll have better chance at finding support if you use cairo, IMO.
Aug 30 07:33:48 <iceTwy>	LRN: deadline soon :/
Aug 30 07:34:22 <LRN>	best of luck to you, then
Aug 30 07:34:42 <iceTwy>	I've taken a look at the code for gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data, dunno why the resulting GdkPixbuf doesn't have the same pixbuf as the one I pass
Aug 30 07:35:42 <nacho>	iceTwy, something similar happened to me, are your argb?
Aug 30 07:35:50 <nacho>	*are you using
Aug 30 07:35:59 <iceTwy>	especially when the only thing gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data does is create a new GdkPixbuf through g_object and do pixbuf->pixels = (const guchar*) passed_pixbuf
Aug 30 07:36:07 <nacho>	iceTwy, for me it was the pre multiplied alpha
Aug 30 07:36:07 <iceTwy>	nacho: no, plain RGB
Aug 30 07:36:16 <nacho>	mmm ok
Aug 30 07:36:21 <iceTwy>	I can upload the code
Aug 30 07:47:11 <iceTwy>	https://gist.github.com/iceTwy/76cabe0ff51a8bb1dbda64b404e52156
Aug 30 07:48:31 <iceTwy>	^ this reads a BMP file and if it has a valid 24 bits per pixel, 8 bit per sample RGB pixbuf, it retrieves the pixbuf so that it's arranged the way GdkPixbuf expects it to be
Aug 30 07:48:50 <iceTwy>	(i.e. RGB instead of BGR and from top left corner to bottom right instead of bottom left to top right)
Aug 30 07:49:26 <iceTwy>	note: the fact that the pixbuf is allocated on the stack is absolutely done on purpose
Aug 30 07:50:00 <iceTwy>	I'm using this image: https://i.imgur.com/n9uqHNx.png
Aug 30 07:51:05 <ebassi>	iceTwy: GdkPixbuf will not copy the data
Aug 30 07:51:26 <ebassi>	iceTwy: gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data() takes a pointer to the data and a free function
Aug 30 07:52:02 <ebassi>	iceTwy: But since you're placing the pixels on the stack, what happens after you get out of the scope is undefined
Aug 30 07:52:34 <ebassi>	iceTwy: You need to allocate or copy the buffer and provide a free function
Aug 30 07:54:14 <iceTwy>	ebassi: alright
Aug 30 07:54:35 <iceTwy>	ebassi: I did think about having this issue but kind of ignored it seeing that it worked *sometimes*
Aug 30 07:55:08 <iceTwy>	basic mistake on my side!
Aug 30 07:55:51 <iceTwy>	ofc once the function is done, the frame is removed from the stack so..
Aug 30 08:56:14 <ebassi>	mclasen: Hey
Aug 30 08:56:31 <mclasen>	here!
Aug 30 08:56:46 <ebassi>	mclasen: When should we publish the blog post about versioning/releases?
Aug 30 08:57:10 <mclasen>	what do you reckon ? today ?
Aug 30 08:57:14 <ebassi>	Alternatively: when's 3.22 scheduled, so I can fix the first paragraph? :-)
Aug 30 08:57:28 <ebassi>	mclasen: I think it's good to go
Aug 30 08:57:32 <mclasen>	I'll do 3.22 just in time for the gnome release
Aug 30 08:58:03 <mclasen>	unless we discover a good reason to delay it (like things that need fixing up for lts)
Aug 30 08:59:03 <mclasen>	I've merged the wayland export api now, and added some language to the docs explaining the stability situation
Aug 30 09:01:29 <bugbot>	New gtk+ bug 770596 filed by mikkel@linet.dk.
Aug 30 09:01:30 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770596 Backend: Win32, normal, gtk-win32-maint, NEW , Unresponsive main window if maximized on a dual monitor system
Aug 30 09:12:12 <hadess>	what's the low-down on https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=766569 ?
Aug 30 09:12:13 <bugbot>	Bug 766569: Widget: GtkScrolledWindow, enhancement, gtkdev, REOPENED , Better size requisition for GTK_SCROLL_NATURAL children
Aug 30 09:12:28 <hadess>	working out whether i should add work-arounds to gnome-control-center panels for that
Aug 30 09:17:41 <nacho>	hey guys
Aug 30 09:18:13 <nacho>	I was wondering if we should have a g_return_... method that takes also a GError
Aug 30 09:18:26 <nacho>	so in the case where the assumption fails it also sets the gerror
Aug 30 09:18:58 <nacho>	since right now in most places we makes the assumption that if NULL or FALSE the error is set but in the case the pre-condition fails we do not set it
Aug 30 09:22:08 <mclasen>	hadess: lets see if tristan is around for some last minute consultation
Aug 30 09:22:32 <mclasen>	tristan: you talked about making the new sw sizing behavior optional
Aug 30 09:23:46 <tristan>	mclasen, yeah, we need to do that, obviously that behavior effects unsuspecting apps and is just not right for many situations
Aug 30 09:24:12 <mclasen>	would you have time to whip up a patch for it ?
Aug 30 09:24:36 <tristan>	mclasen, sure, I could do it tomorrow (here is 10:30pm)
Aug 30 09:24:46 <mclasen>	thanks, thats appreciated
Aug 30 09:25:00 <tristan>	the most difficult part of course, is just choosing the right semantic / property name
Aug 30 09:25:29 <tristan>	we need to add some property unfortunately, it's not right to associate that with the GTK_SCROLL_NATURAL option
Aug 30 09:26:11 <tristan>	at the same time I'll try to whip up some better wording for the docs of that property (obviously was not very clear)
Aug 30 10:49:15 <bugbot>	New glib bug 770603 filed by markos@freevec.org.

Aug 30 11:23:12 *	baedert clicks like a maniac
Aug 30 11:27:47 <nacho>	jjardon, hey
Aug 30 11:28:00 <jjardon>	nacho: hi
Aug 30 11:28:05 <nacho>	jjardon, with the new gettext stuff what is the proper way to generate the .pot file?
Aug 30 11:28:12 <nacho>	I recall running intltool-update in the past
Aug 30 11:33:01 <nacho>	ah! it is generated automatically on make now
Aug 30 11:33:02 <nacho>	good
Aug 30 13:33:04 <mclasen>	Company: in fact, I could use GTK_DEBUG=resize right now
Aug 30 13:33:37 <Company>	mclasen: that just draws stuff, doesn't it?
Aug 30 13:34:37 <mclasen>	I mean what you mentioned yesterday, a debug option that helps tracking down : (gnome-initial-setup:15020): Gtk-WARNING **: gtk_widget_size_allocate(): attempt to underallocate GtkPopover's child GtkBox 0x2f41b60. Allocation is 346x170, but minimum required size is 323x190.
Aug 30 13:36:03 <Company>	that is not a resize problem
Aug 30 13:36:23 <Company>	that is a get_preferred_size() computation problem
Aug 30 13:37:05 <Company>	well, unless it's caused by multiple different resizes trampling on each other
Aug 30 13:37:20 <mclasen>	dunno, it is two wrapping labels in a box in a popover
Aug 30 13:38:05 <Company>	i have no idea what popovers do when wrapping
Aug 30 13:38:21 <mclasen>	maybe I can try to remove all the wrapping and see if it goes away
Aug 30 13:38:46 <Company>	i also have no idea if the warning is wrong
Aug 30 13:38:55 <Company>	maybe 346x170 is a valid size?
Aug 30 13:39:03 <mclasen>	the allocations look like the box assumes that the second label is unwrapped, but then it ends up wrapped anyway
Aug 30 13:42:22 <Company>	this looks like a sizing bug
Aug 30 13:42:44 <Company>	ie GtkPopover does not add the same numbers in get_preferred_size() that it subtracts in size_allocate()
Aug 30 13:44:21 <Company>	never looked at it
Aug 30 13:44:46 <Company>	but I think the height-for-width stuff calculates the for_size wrong
Aug 30 13:45:07 <Company>	ie it doesn't subtract margin/TAIL_HEIGHT
Aug 30 13:45:13 <halfline>	(he just stepped out, he will be back in a few)
Aug 30 13:45:51 <Company>	popover code is written in the old confusing style :/
Aug 30 13:46:10 <Company>	where we don't say "widget size = child size + extra border"
Aug 30 13:46:40 <Company>	and then have a get_extra_border() function that we call from get_preferred_size() and size_allocate() to add/subtract
Aug 30 13:46:59 <Company>	so i'm not sure if anything is wrong, but i guess so
Aug 30 13:47:09 <halfline>	look at gtk_popover_get_rect_coords
Aug 30 13:47:14 <Company>	baedert: you're a popover expert, no?
Aug 30 13:47:28 <Company>	halfline: but that computes coords, not a border
Aug 30 13:47:36 <baedert>	I started porting it to gadgets at some point but got bored
Aug 30 13:47:44 <Company>	halfline: does it do the same stuff as all the get_preferred_* functions?
Aug 30 13:48:03 <halfline>	it seems to account for margin and TAIL_HEIGHT
Aug 30 13:48:16 <baedert>	also popover allocation is also in gtkwindow.c which makes it confusing
Aug 30 13:49:53 <Company>	halfline: yeah, it seems to be that popover_extra_side = border_side + padding_size + MAX (TAIL_HEIGHT, margin_size)
Aug 30 13:50:07 <Company>	s/size/side/g
Aug 30 13:50:11 <baedert>	Usually when fixing those bugs I just printf all the components of the preferred size/allocated sized and look which one could be the difference the output mentions :)
Aug 30 13:50:28 <halfline>	Company: s/side/size/g !
Aug 30 13:51:37 <Company>	oh dammit
Aug 30 13:51:41 <Company>	we even do border width
Aug 30 14:01:23 <halfline>	Company: so it allocates "right" if you turn off label wrapping
Aug 30 14:01:44 <halfline>	so probably something in gtklabel.c versus gtkpopover.c
Aug 30 14:02:30 <baedert>	is there no sizing unit test for popovers?! :)
Aug 30 14:02:32 <vrishab>	Hi.
Aug 30 14:02:52 <vrishab>	Is export GTK_DEBUG=no-pixel-cache recommended for release code ?
Aug 30 14:04:09 <Company>	halfline: no, probably something in gtkpopover.c only
Aug 30 14:04:17 <Company>	halfline: related to height-for-width
Aug 30 14:04:48 <Company>	vrishab: turning on debugging is not recommended for release code ever
Aug 30 14:05:17 <Company>	halfline: which usually means the hfw get_preferred_size() functions don't compute the for_size correctly
Aug 30 14:05:42 *	Company gives up
Aug 30 14:05:51 <Company>	i don't understand what GtkPopover tries to do
Aug 30 14:05:59 *	baedert can't type newlines in the inspector
Aug 30 14:05:59 <Company>	what does it use widget margins for now?!?!
Aug 30 14:06:19 <Company>	baedert: copy/paste works
Aug 30 14:06:49 <Company>	gets you a rectangular box with 000A inside it
Aug 30 14:06:58 <Company>	i think
Aug 30 14:08:22 <vrishab>	Company, Ok. Is there anything which can be done to the prevent this GtkTreeView issue ( Refer https://bug734799.bugzilla-attachments.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=283529 )
Aug 30 14:10:47 <Company>	vrishab: i'm sure there's something that can be done
Aug 30 14:11:04 <Company>	:)
Aug 30 14:11:15 <vrishab>	:)
Aug 30 14:11:22 <baedert>	(:
Aug 30 14:11:24 <vrishab>	you mean app code, or libgtk code 
Aug 30 14:11:43 <Company>	vrishab: looks like a libgtk issue, especially if it works with the debug flag
Aug 30 14:12:23 <Company>	somewhere a redraw is not queued properly I'd guess
Aug 30 14:13:05 <vrishab>	Company, ok.
Aug 30 14:13:14 <vrishab>	wonder if no other app faces this issue.
Aug 30 14:13:33 <baedert>	the filechooser has had similar issues for years
Aug 30 14:13:59 <baedert>	mclasen: Why does that label wrap? Not enough space otherwise?
Aug 30 14:14:14 <mclasen>	max-width-chars
Aug 30 14:14:27 <baedert>	:|
Aug 30 14:15:18 <baedert>	all hail to the clip
Aug 30 14:15:45 <vrishab>	baedert, any bug no ?
Aug 30 14:16:26 <baedert>	the filechooser problems happen when scrolling though, not resize
Aug 30 14:17:50 <baedert>	vrishab: can't find it now
Aug 30 14:18:41 <vrishab>	np, found a bug in filechooser trying this :)
Aug 30 14:19:26 <vrishab>	clearing search by clicking <x| doesn't restore the original list
Aug 30 14:21:30 <halfline>	baedert: Company: interesting enough, if you make the bottom label have max-width-chars >= 43 it fixes it
Aug 30 14:21:44 <halfline>	(it's currently max-width-chars = 40)
Aug 30 14:22:00 <baedert>	Ship it!
Aug 30 14:23:07 <baedert>	No, the reported h4w is correct as far as I can tell, the problem seems to be in gtkwindow.c
Aug 30 14:23:24 <halfline>	but then if you drop margin-right to 15 it breaks at 43 and you have to bump it to 44
Aug 30 14:23:42 <halfline>	(drop from 20 to 15)
Aug 30 14:23:52 <halfline>	(16 works fine with 43)
Aug 30 14:25:24 <baedert>	the rect passed to size-allocate is 150 high
Aug 30 14:25:28 <baedert>	the min height is 160
Aug 30 14:25:33 <baedert>	the height used for the label is 120
Aug 30 14:25:39 <baedert>	\o/
Aug 30 14:30:15 <hergertme>	mclasen: libide/transfers/ide-transfers-button.c in ide_transfers_button_begin_theatrics()
Aug 30 14:30:39 <hergertme>	mclasen: it uses our libide/theatrics/ide-box-theatric.c helper w/ EggAnimation
Aug 30 14:30:49 <mclasen>	I was shown a screencast, thanks
Aug 30 14:31:09 <mclasen>	looks about right, nice stuff
Aug 30 14:31:53 <hergertme>	the screenshot does not to the FPS justice :(
Aug 30 14:31:58 <hergertme>	its quite smooth otherwise
Aug 30 14:32:51 <mclasen>	I would expect no less :-)
Aug 30 14:53:16 <baedert>	halfline: Fixed it! http://paste.fedoraproject.org/417532/47258318/
Aug 30 15:03:39 <baedert>	mclasen: so, the problem is that in get_prefered_foo, we're addng the TAIL_SIZE only once
Aug 30 15:04:23 <baedert>	or rather, in get_preferred_height_for_width, we never subtract the tail size from the width we pass to the child widget
Aug 30 15:04:48 <mclasen>	sounds plausible
Aug 30 15:05:08 *	mclasen not looking at the code, just mumbling 
Aug 30 15:06:14 <baedert>	I'm pretty sure I can break popovers heavily by setting the correct css margin/widget margin values
Aug 30 15:07:33 <baedert>	But maybe not because I'm an idiot and still had my last patch applied when I tried that?
Aug 30 15:38:49 <coolkid87>	Does Gtk+ CSS styleprovider support 3D animations?
Aug 30 15:39:22 <coolkid87>	e.g. rotateZ() and such?
Aug 30 15:40:19 <mclasen>	no
Aug 30 15:40:30 <coolkid87>	okay
Aug 30 15:44:01 <coolkid87>	In which version of Gtk+ GSK(scenegraph kit) is coming? 
Aug 30 15:44:49 <baedert>	mclasen: https://paste.xinu.at/m-iOPl9f/ Ignore the first one, the second one was just so that I could even wrap my head around what that funciton was doing
Aug 30 15:45:04 <baedert>	mclasen: And the third one is also weird because _get_rect is weird
Aug 30 15:59:21 <mclasen>	baedert: I'm with Company (can't really make out what the code does)
Aug 30 15:59:26 <mclasen>	so if your patches help, go for it
Aug 30 15:59:39 <mclasen>	you're the only one who has an idea

Aug 30 16:36:18 <djb>	yeah btw i got ticket editing powers a week or 2 ago. not sure that was intentional?
Aug 30 16:36:29 <djb>	someone was probably trying to ban me and their hand slipped...
Aug 30 17:19:01 <vrishab>	Just a clarification. Is this a glib issue ? http://paste.debian.net/796142/
Aug 30 17:19:27 <vrishab>	that ended in a SIGSEGV
Aug 30 17:22:20 <hergertme>	vrishab: glib does the only safe thing it can on OOM, abort
Aug 30 17:22:29 <hergertme>	so that is by design
Aug 30 17:24:40 <hergertme>	although hrmm, that is in _int_malloc, so i guess that might not be our OOM branch
Aug 30 17:25:12 <tpm>	is the SIGSEGV actually from that thread? are there other active threads?
Aug 30 17:31:27 <vrishab>	Sorry, I lost the core file, but refer to https://bugzilla.gnome.org/page.cgi?id=traceparser/trace.html&trace_id=236585 for details
Aug 30 17:32:02 <vrishab>	hergertme, it is surely not oom, since there was enough memory in the system.
Aug 30 17:32:23 <vrishab>	tpm, I just did a gdb app corefile and bt
Aug 30 17:32:38 <hergertme>	vrishab: possibly, of course if you are 32-bit you can still run out of virtual memory
Aug 30 17:33:04 <vrishab>	nope, 64-bit
Aug 30 17:33:47 <hergertme>	vrishab: try `thread apply all bt`
Aug 30 17:40:51 <vrishab>	will try
Aug 30 17:44:17 <hergertme>	basically, on sigsegv im unsure if gdb leaves you on the thread the caused it or thread-0. so its possible, as tpm said, that the sigsegv was from another thread.
Aug 30 17:45:27 <djb>	wow, i hope i remember that next time i get a segfault...
Aug 30 17:46:54 <hergertme>	(just remember that "thread apply all <command>" will run the command for every thread)
Aug 30 17:46:55 <vrishab>	hergertme, feeling cheated by gdb :) .. will check it next time for sure.
Aug 30 17:47:06 <vrishab>	thread apply all bt
Aug 30 17:47:15 <hergertme>	if you still have the core file, and the binary you ran, you can still get it
Aug 30 17:47:25 <djb>	does Builder have a clever way around this? :)
Aug 30 17:47:58 <hergertme>	djb: i just created the debugger branch yesterday, so not quite there yet :)
Aug 30 17:48:21 <vrishab>	I'm trying to get the core file. trashed it by mistake.
Aug 30 17:48:27 <hergertme>	vrishab: gdb /path/to/binary /path/to/corefile (iirc)
Aug 30 17:49:00 <djb>	well, it seems to be rocketing along, so won't be long heh
Aug 30 17:50:14 <hergertme>	the hard part is the design (as usual)
Aug 30 17:52:08 <djb>	i have been known, on certain days, to spend more time worrying which side to put buttons on and how much spacing to put between widgets... than adding features
Aug 30 17:53:10 <djb>	can't argue with the end result though haha
Aug 30 17:53:25 <hergertme>	that's what side-tracked me with the gobject generator i started on...
Aug 30 17:54:08 <hergertme>	"this is horrible" ... "shouldnt this just be a refactor operation" ... "why do we even have ui for this?" -> give up
Aug 30 17:54:17 <djb>	dang. just make it into a library and get someone else to write the UI :p
Aug 30 17:55:12 <hergertme>	for 3.24, my main goals are refactory engine and debugger. so i think we'll be able to do stuff like "Add gobject property" to a file and it will use the clang AST to determine where to add the enums, get/set prop helpers, declarations, etc
Aug 30 17:55:39 <hergertme>	if only we had GProperty :(
Aug 30 18:00:12 <lone_wolf>	Is there a GTK widget similar to the rebar in Windows? A rebar is basically a container for toolbars which allows the user to move and rearrange them.
Aug 30 18:01:27 <hergertme>	lone_wolf: GtkToolbar is probably what you are looking for
Aug 30 18:01:48 <hergertme>	i dont think you'll find anything as fancy, as say, windows Ribbons though
Aug 30 18:02:05 <djb>	cough thank goodness for that. whuh?
Aug 30 18:02:29 <lone_wolf>	I'm looking for something similar to the Office 2003 toolbars.
Aug 30 18:03:03 <lone_wolf>	I've seen some GTK apps that have toolbars with grippers where they can be dragged around, but I'm not sure how that's done.
Aug 30 18:03:03 <djb>	GtkNotebook would handle the tabbing i guess
Aug 30 18:05:15 <djb>	maybe relevant: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1609453
Aug 30 18:06:46 <djb>	my guess is that such toolbars are using custom widgets that handle the DND events, but i might be wrong. can't think of a standard widget supporting that though
Aug 30 18:06:53 <djb>	got an example app?
Aug 30 18:06:57 <hergertme>	(deprecated) heh
Aug 30 18:08:05 <djb>	what is?
Aug 30 18:08:08 <lone_wolf>	Is GtkHandleBox usable from GTK in C? Everything I see seems to be about PyGTK.
Aug 30 18:08:26 <djb>	oh, most of GtkToolbar, haha
Aug 30 18:08:50 <djb>	that's the weird thing about googling for GTK+. is python _that_ popular?
Aug 30 18:09:05 <djb>	pygtk is GTK+2, ffs
Aug 30 18:09:21 <djb>	but in this case the search is trivial: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkHandleBox.html
Aug 30 18:10:00 <djb>	there's an official Python binding for GTK+ 3, yet it seems to have nowhere near the same level of google saturation
Aug 30 18:10:47 <lone_wolf>	GTK2 apps have always been more responsive in my experience, especially through ssh.
Aug 30 18:10:53 <djb>	bad news: "
Aug 30 18:10:57 <djb>	gtk_handle_box_new has been deprecated since version 3.4 and should not be used in newly-written code. GtkHandleBox has been deprecated."
Aug 30 18:11:37 <djb>	well, GTK+2 is certainly famous, but what i find more staggering is how pygtk results often seem to drown out native C ones
Aug 30 18:13:23 <djb>	the outside impression i get is that toolbaresque widgets are on the way out, as GTK+ aims for the more GNOMEy approach of HeaderBars, Popovers, etc
Aug 30 18:14:22 <lone_wolf>	Yeah, I don't like gedit anymore because of that. I imagine it works well on touchscreens, though.
Aug 30 18:14:50 <lone_wolf>	Is there a way to get a menu's child item based on its index?
Aug 30 18:15:27 <djb>	i use gnome on a laptop exclusively and just like how it doesn't bombard me with visual overload all the time, like e.g. an Office ribbon... opinions etc
Aug 30 18:16:43 <djb>	from a GtkMenu?
Aug 30 18:18:19 <lone_wolf>	Ah, gtk_container_foreach() should work for me.
Aug 30 18:18:27 <djb>	I don't see one. set_active(n) then widget = get_active() would be a hack that the documentation explicitly warns against ;)
Aug 30 18:29:25 <lone_wolf>	Why are they so many of these typedefs, like gchar for char and gpointer for void*? I don't see the point of renaming standard C data types.
Aug 30 18:33:43 <djb>	so don't use them. iirc they'd created a bunch of fixed-width typedefs back when the stdlib lacked those, and they probably tacked the primitives on for some sense of consistency
Aug 30 18:34:21 <djb>	nowadays it's probably more of a coding convention habit than anything else
Aug 30 18:36:31 <hergertme>	you don't want to know why gchar, gint, gdouble, etc exist ...
Aug 30 18:36:39 <hergertme>	its because emacs highlighted them differently
Aug 30 18:37:00 <hergertme>	but in general, if we could ever do an API/ABI break of glib/gobject, we'd probably drop all that
Aug 30 18:37:06 <djb>	oh lol
Aug 30 18:37:55 <hergertme>	ive cargo culted myself into doing them, but im pretty tollerant of superficial stuff like that
Aug 30 18:38:24 <hergertme>	typedef'ing * types to not having * sort of annoys me, but as long as it stops at gpointer, i can live
Aug 30 18:38:47 <djb>	there'd be no ABI break for any of the primitives, i presume
Aug 30 18:40:03 <hergertme>	yeah, just syntax recompile 
Aug 30 18:41:48 <djb>	i guess lazy users could just #include <glib/gtypedefs.h> or something and never have to find-and-replace

Aug 31 03:09:20 <slomo>	nacho: were you able to run the glib/glib-networking/libsoup tests with my win32 patch? (as said, those tests don't even succeed or compile without my patch) :)
Aug 31 03:42:53 <nacho>	slomo, hey
Aug 31 03:43:17 <nacho>	slomo, see that I used wip/openssl of glib-networking
Aug 31 03:44:04 <nacho>	and I suppose you used msys2?
Aug 31 03:44:06 <nacho>	while I used msvc
Aug 31 03:51:40 <slomo>	nacho: the toolchain we use for gstreamer, but yes
Aug 31 03:51:48 <slomo>	nacho: openssl vs gnutls should not really matter here
Aug 31 03:52:14 <nacho>	slomo, the toolchain might though
Aug 31 03:52:35 <nacho>	slomo, btw is cerbero working with msvc?
Aug 31 03:55:28 <slomo>	nacho: see http://blog.nirbheek.in/2016/05/gstreamer-and-meson-new-hope.html and http://blog.nirbheek.in/2016/07/building-and-developing-gstreamer-using.html
Aug 31 03:56:31 <nacho>	slomo, yeah I saw those posts
Aug 31 03:57:13 <nacho>	but when I checked the cerbero code I did not see how it builds the msvc using the official msvc/nmake projects
Aug 31 03:57:22 <nacho>	so I supposed that it was not ready yet
Aug 31 03:57:37 <nacho>	slomo, from our side we maintain this one: https://github.com/wingtk/gtk-win32
Aug 31 03:57:39 <tpm>	nacho, which official msvc/nmake projects? glib ones?
Aug 31 03:57:45 <slomo>	nacho: it's using the meson generated MSVC projects (in the cerbero branch linked from there)
Aug 31 03:58:24 <tpm>	nacho, we have a meson-based build for glib that we use there, we don't use the official msvc projects
Aug 31 03:58:25 <nacho>	tpm, we are providing the msvc or nmake projects for each library
Aug 31 03:58:35 <nacho>	glib/gtk/libxml2 etc
Aug 31 03:58:50 <nacho>	I see
Aug 31 04:00:12 <tpm>	is the toolchain relevant for that gsocket patch though?
Aug 31 04:00:37 <nacho>	as pointed out it can go in
Aug 31 04:00:42 <nacho>	but it can definitely be relevant
Aug 31 04:04:30 <slomo>	yeah, everything is relevant on windows unfortunately. no idea how anybody is not losing their mind developing on/for windows
Aug 31 04:06:32 <slomo>	nacho: can you merge that patch for me? i assume you have a version that cleanly applies to git master already?
Aug 31 04:07:11 <nacho>	slomo, see that I haven't tested the patch
Aug 31 04:07:19 <nacho>	I assumed you did and the patch seemed fair
Aug 31 04:08:21 <slomo>	nacho: i thought you just told me that you were running the tests with the patch :)
Aug 31 04:08:55 <nacho>	slomo, I run those tests a few months ago and they were passing *without* the patch
Aug 31 04:09:06 <slomo>	ah
Aug 31 04:09:30 <slomo>	then i misunderstood you
Aug 31 04:09:59 <slomo>	well, i'll have to update the patch to latest git master and then retest. might take a while, it was all very long ago already
Aug 31 04:10:15 <slomo>	i won't be able to run the tests though, they don't succeed for me without my patch either
Aug 31 04:11:16 <slomo>	i'll put it on my list :)
Aug 31 04:52:17 <nacho>	ebassi, hey
Aug 31 04:52:28 <nacho>	ebassi, this patch seems fair to me: https://github.com/hsccr/gtk-win32/commit/593a414bd40e1de9487c857f97a91ce9e7f7c6e3
Aug 31 05:02:40 <coolkid87>	Sorry for cross posting, I've written this in #c++ but the channel seems not to be very active so I'm writing it here.
Aug 31 05:02:43 <coolkid87>	Does "composite template" option in glade UI files have any special meaning in gtkmm or it's for C only?
Aug 31 05:02:45 <coolkid87>	I mean in Gtk+ C API there are functions for setting a XML template for a widget class, I guess it's same as having a static Gtk::Builder(RefPtr) object loaded from normal UI XML in Widget class definition?
Aug 31 05:02:46 <coolkid87>	because I see no parallel API in gtkmm for those functions, e.g. gtk_widget_class_set_template
Aug 31 05:40:36 <ebassi>	nacho: Not sure; we don't have any other translation mechanism inside Clutter — but it's not like I care that much.

Aug 31 06:22:07 <tristan>	Anyone familiar with this GTK+ build error ? https://paste.fedoraproject.org/417753/14726388/raw/ ... it happens when building old GTK+ 3.2.4 against more modern libs
Aug 31 06:22:19 <tristan>	did we get an ABI break in gdk-pixbuf at some point ?
Aug 31 06:26:06 <mclasen>	you need a -UGDK_PIXBUF_DISABLE_DEPRECATED somewhere
Aug 31 06:26:46 <tristan>	mclasen, ahhh, and possibly same for glib ?
Aug 31 06:26:55 <mclasen>	unlikely
Aug 31 06:27:14 <tristan>	I pass that error with a gdk-pixbuf 2.26.1 of the same era... but then fail on undefined reference to g_module_close()
Aug 31 06:27:26 <mclasen>	thats odd
Aug 31 06:28:16 <mclasen>	you may miss a gmodule-2.0 in a PKG_CHECK_MODULES line somewhere ?
Aug 31 06:28:18 <tristan>	its from the introspection building though... https://paste.fedoraproject.org/417765/26392781/
Aug 31 06:28:43 <tristan>	anyway, I'll try just backing down the glib... at this point I'm just doing an ugly hack

Aug 31 07:06:11 <alex>	no, 1.6
Aug 31 07:06:14 <ebassi>	But xdg-shell v6 is in 1.7
Aug 31 07:06:18 <alex>	i see
Aug 31 07:06:26 <alex>	so, gtk3 build reqs should be bumped
Aug 31 07:06:30 <ebassi>	Yes
Aug 31 07:06:32 <alex>	it requires 1.6
Aug 31 07:06:39 <mclasen>	oh, that slipped through

Aug 31 07:07:27 *	mclasen fixes
Aug 31 07:07:55 <alex>	I guess i'll move to git master of wayland and wayland-protocols
Aug 31 07:07:59 <alex>	is that right?
Aug 31 07:08:05 <nacho>	slomo, I would definitely love to slowly transit to it
Aug 31 07:08:14 <nacho>	instead of having to deal with visual studio projects
Aug 31 07:08:35 <nacho>	slomo, but i.e for gettext I had to anyway apply a shitload of patches to get it building with msvc

Aug 31 09:19:26 <seb_>	ciao, I have a question. please don't laugh too much at me. I read the gtk tutorial, and when we reach the part of the application example it seems one should use clases and templates for an application.

Aug 31 09:23:06 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770646 general, normal, gtkdev, NEW , glib: Namespace global tapset variables by soname
Aug 31 09:28:35 <seb_>	mclasen: yes correct. 
Aug 31 09:30:00 <seb_>	mclasen: the definition of the struct and their usage, as well as the separation of the into multiple files (class) is not much clear. so I was wondering if there was somewhere a graph
Aug 31 09:30:07 <ebassi>	seb_: You can create as many windows you want; the GtkApplication class will keep track of them, as long as you either set the GtkWindow:application property or call gtk_application_add_window()
Aug 31 09:30:48 <ebassi>	seb_: Each class in the API reference has its hierarchy graph
Aug 31 09:31:04 <ebassi>	https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkApplicationWindow.html#GtkApplicationWindow.object-hierarchy
Aug 31 09:31:36 <seb_>	ebassi: when I meant graph, I indended a visual representatoin of the object in a graphic
Aug 31 09:31:51 <ebassi>	seb_: What kind of visual representation?
Aug 31 09:32:03 <seb_>	I don t know, kind of a picture
Aug 31 09:32:31 <ebassi>	seb_: I'm sorry, but I don't understand what *kind* of graph you want
Aug 31 09:32:50 <ebassi>	Do you have an example?
Aug 31 09:33:10 <seb_>	umh nope. 
Aug 31 09:33:26 <seb_>	but when I look at the gedit code and the application example code. I see a lot mode definition in the struct
Aug 31 09:33:41 <seb_>	that is the reason I don't understand what they are needed for.
Aug 31 09:34:06 <ebassi>	seb_: In which struct? In the instance structure?
Aug 31 09:34:28 <seb_>	I simply added my window to the gtk application and this is working well. I didn't create any private structure for that neither defined classes. that is the reason I am asking. 
Aug 31 09:34:46 <seb_>	struct _ExampleAppWindow or struct _ExampleAppWindowClass
Aug 31 09:34:58 <seb_>	I don't understand their real purpose
Aug 31 09:35:18 <seb_>	but I was thinking that is becuaswe this is an example. and ina real application they take all their sense
Aug 31 09:35:23 <ebassi>	seb_: You can avoid subclassing with GtkApplication and GtkApplicationWindow, though it's generally good code sanity to subclass them if you go beyond the "example" case
Aug 31 09:36:14 <seb_>	ebassi: exactly that is what I thought. But I guess they need to be expanded with more than a window I guess. 
Aug 31 09:36:14 <ebassi>	If you need to start attaching your own data structures to the application window, or the application singleton, for instance
Aug 31 09:36:28 <seb_>	ebassi: one should define there all the widget ? 
Aug 31 09:37:16 <ebassi>	seb_: Well, if you use a GtkBuilder template to define your UI, it's usually a good idea to subclass GtkApplicationWindow
Aug 31 09:37:43 <seb_>	ebassi: in my test, I actually used the gtkbuilder, but not the template one. 
Aug 31 09:37:50 <seb_>	just building from the glade file
Aug 31 09:38:34 <ebassi>	seb_: That's pretty much the Old Style™ for building UIs
Aug 31 09:38:52 <ebassi>	These days, subclassing and using templates is the recommended practice
Aug 31 09:38:55 <seb_>	:/ ... damm. that is all new for me :D
Aug 31 09:39:01 <LRN>	I thought "Old Style" is creating widgets one by one in your code, manually
Aug 31 09:39:12 <ebassi>	LRN: That's the Old Old Style™
Aug 31 09:39:21 <ebassi>	We went through a bunch of those
Aug 31 09:39:30 <LRN>	Ah, okay then
Aug 31 09:39:31 <seb_>	ebassi: indeed that is what I could feel when readoing the documentaiton and checking gedit programm. 
Aug 31 09:39:39 <ebassi>	There's also the Old Old Old Style™ that used Glade to autogenerate C code :-)
Aug 31 09:39:55 <LRN>	In that case i'm using the Old Style
Aug 31 09:40:07 <ebassi>	seb_: gedit is a pretty complex code base; you may want to look at simpler application
Aug 31 09:40:36 <seb_>	ebassi: would you have one to propose which comes to your mind ? 
Aug 31 09:41:22 <seb_>	or maybe there is another example which would help me to understand better the usage of the struct/class 
Aug 31 09:41:49 <ebassi>	seb_: gnome-dictionary is fairly trivial
Aug 31 09:41:58 <ebassi>	seb_: And it uses multiple windows
Aug 31 09:49:06 <seb_>	ebassi: thank you. I found it on github
Aug 31 09:55:49 <LebedevRI>	question about " Using Pango syntax for the font: style property is deprecated; please use CSS syntax". if i had "font: Sans 8;", it should be "font: 8pt Sans;" now?
Aug 31 09:56:44 <jadahl>	alex: pong
Aug 31 09:56:59 <LebedevRI>	and, does gtk <=3.20 actually support that new css syntax? it does not seem to
Aug 31 10:03:33 <mclasen_afk>	LebedevRI: you can also use font-size: and font-family: separately
Aug 31 10:03:51 <mclasen_afk>	maybe thats better than relying on the vagarities of shorthand syntax...
Aug 31 10:04:15 <alex>	jadahl: So, gtk3 master requires wayland 1.7, which is unreleased
Aug 31 10:04:38 <alex>	jadahl: I want to build gtk3 in the nightly flatpak gnome sdk
Aug 31 10:04:58 <jadahl>	why does it require wayland 1.7?
Aug 31 10:05:09 <jadahl>	wayland-protocols 1.7 is released
Aug 31 10:05:10 <alex>	jadahl: What wayland should i put in there? Do i point it at git master of wayland-protocols?
Aug 31 10:05:13 <jadahl>	wayland 1.7 is very old
Aug 31 10:05:22 <alex>	i mean wayland-protocols
Aug 31 10:05:31 <alex>	oh, 1.7 is released?
Aug 31 10:05:41 <jadahl>	https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2016-August/030606.html
Aug 31 10:05:51 <jadahl>	with tar balls and all
Aug 31 10:06:15 <alex>	Why didn't i find that when i searched?=
Aug 31 10:06:19 <alex>	whatever, thanks!
Aug 31 10:06:49 <jadahl>	good question. its on the website as well
Aug 31 10:07:05 <alex>	I guess i was confused by the gtk3 configure output that erronously said it required 1.6
Aug 31 10:07:10 <alex>	so, i assumed it was the latest
Aug 31 10:07:37 <jadahl>	gtk says it needs 1.6? I thought I bumped that
Aug 31 10:07:41 <jadahl>	because gtk needs 1.7
Aug 31 10:07:44 <mclasen_afk>	I fixed it just now
Aug 31 10:08:02 <alex>	yeah: https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=738b1e3eece46703106640fe764bb8eacad411cc
Aug 31 10:08:15 <jadahl>	\o/
Aug 31 10:08:22 <alex>	what about wayland itself
Aug 31 10:08:30 <alex>	is there anything important in 1.12?
Aug 31 10:08:32 <jadahl>	let me check
Aug 31 10:08:35 <jadahl>	no
Aug 31 10:09:17 <alex>	Also, what is the API/ABI stability of wayland and wayland-protocols?
Aug 31 10:09:45 <alex>	In the freedesktop base runtime we currently have wayland 1.10.0, and protocols 1.3
Aug 31 10:09:51 <mclasen_afk>	wayland-protocols contains both stable and unstable protocols
Aug 31 10:10:04 <jadahl>	wayland is api/abi stable
Aug 31 10:10:26 <alex>	runtimes are supposed to be very stable, so i didn't bump that in the base, just in the gnome-from-git-master layer
Aug 31 10:10:45 <alex>	But maybe its safe to do it in the base?
Aug 31 10:11:01 <mclasen_afk>	the only unstable protocol that we hard-require in gtk is xdg-shell (we fall back to x if it is missing/wrong version)
Aug 31 10:11:13 <baedert>	mclasen_afk: https://paste.xinu.at/m-J9uw2/ should fix both cases fwiw
Aug 31 10:11:16 <mclasen_afk>	everything else we only use if it is presnet
Aug 31 10:11:44 <jadahl>	we don't use any recent libwayland-client feature as far as I can see
Aug 31 10:12:07 <alex>	I guess the question is, if some old app built against 1.10.0/1.3 would things ever break if a) you ran an old app build but wayland was updated, or 2) You rebuild your old app, but wayland was updated
Aug 31 10:12:37 <jadahl>	alex: it'll fallback on x11
Aug 31 10:12:51 <alex>	what will?
Aug 31 10:12:55 <jadahl>	gdk
Aug 31 10:13:14 <alex>	I'm talking in abstract here, any possible flatpak app that does whatever
Aug 31 10:13:20 <alex>	not specifically what gtk would do
Aug 31 10:14:25 <jadahl>	any runtime or wayland talking thing will until protocols have tstabalized need to handle the situations where it (the protocol doesn't exist)
Aug 31 10:14:30 <alex>	You build the-app 0.45 against a runtime with wayland 1.10/1.3. Then the runtime is updated to (say) 1.11/1.7, could anything break?
Aug 31 10:15:04 <alex>	the-app may be using gtk, or sdl2, or custom wayland hackery
Aug 31 10:15:39 <jadahl>	assuming we are talking about wayland here, sdl2 will work since it uses x11 by default
Aug 31 10:15:46 <alex>	(I'm considering updating it because its likely not many apps use wayland anyway)
Aug 31 10:15:59 <jadahl>	custo wayland hackery wont work on operating system from 2017 if it uses the unstable protocols from today
Aug 31 10:16:27 <jadahl>	I've been urging flatpaks shouldn't use wayland until the protocols needed have stabalized
Aug 31 10:16:41 <jadahl>	but if they are to use wayland, they should be able to fallback to x11
Aug 31 10:16:55 <jadahl>	sdl2 in the fdo runtime should use x11 still for example
Aug 31 10:16:56 <alex>	yeah, but if it was built against 1.3 it can't use newer protocols
Aug 31 10:17:48 <jadahl>	if the app only relies on stable protocols, if it built against 1.3 itll work with 1.13
Aug 31 10:17:59 <jadahl>	(note that wayland-protocols is purely a build time dependency)
Aug 31 10:18:16 <alex>	I guess one issue is that if i update wayland-protocols in the runtime then some app build may pick up a newer dependencies and thus break if you don't update your runtime to the latest version 
Aug 31 10:18:39 <alex>	I'll keep it as-is for now i guess
Aug 31 10:18:44 <jadahl>	so far wayland-protocols have been 100% backward compatible, since all old unstable protocols are still shipped
Aug 31 10:19:18 <jadahl>	the protocols shipped have not, but they have been broken "gracefully" i.e. the server/client that wwants to use a new protocol must change.
Aug 31 10:19:55 <jadahl>	but there is no point in putting wayland-protocols in the runtime. only in the sdk
Aug 31 10:20:49 <alex>	Well, by "runtime" here i mean both the platform and the sdk
Aug 31 10:21:04 <alex>	with corresponding bits in the right place
Aug 31 10:21:36 <jadahl>	ok
Aug 31 10:22:59 <mclasen_afk>	baedert: maybe you can convince Company to look at the patches ? I'm stuck in meetings...
Aug 31 10:24:36 <baedert>	mclasen_afk: I'll try, have fun :)
Aug 31 10:25:07 <baedert>	Company: https://paste.xinu.at/m-J9uw2/ Are the last 2 fine with you?
Aug 31 10:26:55 <LebedevRI>	mclasen_afk: all of which is 3.21+?
Aug 31 10:27:03 <LebedevRI>	that did not answer my questions
Aug 31 10:27:12 <mclasen_afk>	no, font-size and font-family have always been supported
Aug 31 10:27:22 <mclasen_afk>	the only thing that changed is the parsing of the shorthand
Aug 31 10:28:01 <Company>	baedert: does the size request code do the same crap with widget margins?
Aug 31 10:28:33 <Company>	or is that just for x/y ?
Aug 31 10:29:41 <Company>	baedert: also: w -= MAX (2 * TAIL_HEIGHT, margin.left + margin.right); is wrong
Aug 31 10:30:03 <Company>	set margin.left to HUGE and margin.right to 0
Aug 31 10:30:25 <Company>	you want HUGE + TAIL_HEIGHT as the result of the calculation
Aug 31 10:30:30 <Company>	but you'll get just HUGE
Aug 31 10:30:52 <baedert>	but that was there before as well?
Aug 31 10:32:43 <Company>	no
Aug 31 10:33:18 <Company>	before that it was MAX(TAIL_HEIGHT, margin.left) + MAX(TAIL_HEIGHT, margin.right)
Aug 31 10:33:44 <Company>	MAX(x, y) + MAX(x, z) != MAX(2x, y + z)

Aug 31 11:18:46 *	Topic for #gtk+ set by Company (Fri Aug 19 18:16:57 2016)
Aug 31 11:26:13 <Company>	baedert: yes
Aug 31 11:26:25 <Company>	baedert: but they also automatically get subtracted when size allocating
Aug 31 11:27:28 <baedert>	removing the widget margin stuff in _get_rect woks for left/right but now top/bottom is broken
Aug 31 11:31:57 <Company>	i have no idea how popovers work
Aug 31 11:32:07 <Company>	what size does a popover request?
Aug 31 11:32:11 <Company>	border box?
Aug 31 11:32:13 <Company>	margin box?
Aug 31 11:32:43 <Company>	it doesn't seem to use clip either
Aug 31 11:32:56 <Company>	imo it should request border box like any other widget
Aug 31 11:33:01 <Company>	and use clipping
Aug 31 11:33:24 <baedert>	request border box?
Aug 31 11:33:26 <Company>	for both margin and the arrow (it's called tail?)
Aug 31 11:33:40 <Company>	yes
Aug 31 11:33:49 <Company>	or do we request margin box?
Aug 31 11:34:40 <Company>	we request margin box
Aug 31 11:34:42 <Company>	whoops
Aug 31 11:35:03 <Company>	guess i was confused because i thought about negative margins for too long
Aug 31 11:35:44 <Company>	then my only question becomes: how are popovers placed?
Aug 31 11:35:58 <baedert>	check gtkwindow.c
Aug 31 11:36:00 <Company>	ie who computes the x/y coords and how?
Aug 31 11:36:54 <baedert>	I think they were supposed to use the new gdk menu placing stuff but I'm not sure if that's the case right now
Aug 31 11:37:37 <Company>	can you explain to me how popovers are meant to be placed?
Aug 31 11:38:03 <baedert>	not really
Aug 31 11:38:04 <Company>	do they get an x/y coordinate inside some other widget and are placed so they can point there?
Aug 31 11:38:47 <baedert>	they have either a rectangle or a widget they point to
Aug 31 11:38:59 <baedert>	and gtkwindow.c tries to place them so they fit into the toplevel
Aug 31 11:40:15 <Company>	by aligning one side of the rect with one side of the popover?
Aug 31 11:41:19 <Company>	#ifdef WAYLAND
Aug 31 11:41:25 <Company>	  do_everything_different()
Aug 31 11:41:27 <Company>	#else
Aug 31 11:41:30 <Company>	  whatever()
Aug 31 11:41:31 <Company>	#endif
Aug 31 11:41:33 <Company>	yay!
Aug 31 11:41:48 <Company>	this is all clearly poke-at-it-until-it-looks-like-it-works code
Aug 31 11:42:57 <Company>	okay, what i would do:
Aug 31 11:43:08 <Company>	(1) delete all widget margin stuff
Aug 31 11:43:19 <Company>	hope nothing breaks
Aug 31 11:43:34 <baedert>	wayland makes some breakage way more obvious than x: https://paste.xinu.at/FACD/ :)
Aug 31 11:43:36 <Company>	(2) do what your patches did
Aug 31 11:44:21 <Company>	or it's just broken on wayland
Aug 31 11:44:37 <Company>	do_everything_different() etc
Aug 31 11:45:14 <mclasen>	baedert: what did you expect to happen ?
Aug 31 11:48:27 <baedert>	mclasen: No idea, but something else
Aug 31 11:49:08 <baedert>	I'd not have a problem with the popover being cut off in this case, or it just getting closed
Aug 31 11:50:55 <Company>	mclasen: conceptually, I think there's 2 types of behaviors
Aug 31 11:51:01 <Company>	mclasen: modal and nonmodal
Aug 31 11:51:29 <Company>	mclasen: modal popovers should close once you start resizing (ie lose focus) - just like menus do
Aug 31 11:51:52 <Company>	mclasen: and nonmodal ones should probably be clipped by what they're contained in - kinda like overlays in GtkOverlay
Aug 31 11:52:40 <mclasen>	makes sense, at least for popovers that are contained in the toplevel
Aug 31 11:52:54 <mclasen>	not sure about those that hang out
Aug 31 11:53:03 <Company>	i'm not sure if both of these use cases are meant  to be solved by GtkPopover btw
Aug 31 11:53:27 <Company>	hanging out for me clearly means modal
Aug 31 11:53:32 <mclasen>	cosimoc: did you seem my sushi / wayland patch ?
Aug 31 11:53:50 <mclasen>	see, even
Aug 31 11:54:31 <Company>	but the whole use case could maybe better be fixed by a new toplevel thing that's somewhere inbetween popovers and menus
Aug 31 11:55:29 <Company>	while the non-modal case might best be solved without any child windows at all and just using clipping
Aug 31 11:55:40 <Company>	of the relevant widgets
Aug 31 11:55:45 <Company>	hrm
Aug 31 11:56:03 <Company>	though we need WM interaction that wayland won't give us because wayland...
Aug 31 11:56:20 <Company>	if we want to exceed the toplevel allocation that is
Aug 31 12:00:16 <Company>	but do we actually want to exceed the toplevel allocation with non-modal (ie permanent) popovers?
Aug 31 12:00:51 <Company>	because clearly they can be nested and multiple can be open at once (at least in theory)
Aug 31 12:01:19 <mclasen>	so far, we've treated modality and containment as independent
Aug 31 12:04:15 <Company>	i wonder if we should have "layers" as in web speak
Aug 31 12:04:45 <Company>	ie so that you can say "this widget is drawn on top of everything else but placed like a regular widget"
Aug 31 12:06:20 <Company>	kinda like position: fixed or position: absolute or z-order: -1 or so
Aug 31 12:07:06 <mclasen>	cosimoc: nevermind, I see now that you did. Mind if I do a sushi release with that fix ?
Aug 31 12:08:16 <Company>	and then we don't just allow toplevels but any widget to be a root for layers
Aug 31 12:08:31 <Company>	then we can for example make GtkScrolledWindow or GtkNotebook such a root
Aug 31 12:09:00 <Company>	and ensure popuops inside them get properly clipped to stay inside them
Aug 31 12:10:13 <mclasen>	sounds beautiful
Aug 31 12:11:25 <vrishab>	Hi.
Aug 31 12:11:55 <vrishab>	after upgrading to the latest gtk in debian unstable, I get a lot of these

Aug 31 14:37:38 <djb>	3.21 just hit debian unstable, so fun times ahead
Aug 31 14:38:56 <djb>	GTK+ 3.21 that is; Polari is till 3.20.3
Aug 31 14:39:15 <djb>	*still
Aug 31 14:41:03 <hergertme>	djb: that is almost certainly caused by GtkScrolledWindow:max-content-height not being set
Aug 31 14:42:10 <djb>	thanks. anyone got the master version handy to check if it's still an issue there?
Aug 31 14:42:13 <hergertme>	which personally i think is a bug, because i think it should act the same as before the property was added. but i didn't do the gtk+ code so im not sure what the intention was there.
Aug 31 14:42:34 *	mclasen goes to review the patch
Aug 31 14:42:38 *	hergertme did the EggScrolledWindow version, but i think tristan or feaneron did the upstreaming into gtk+
Aug 31 14:43:01 <baedert>	just wait for that patch to land
Aug 31 14:43:03 <hergertme>	in EggScrolledWindow, we only applied max if it was not -1 iirc
Aug 31 14:43:04 <djb>	as it looks like it might be updated for it: https://git.gnome.org/browse/polari/tree/src/userList.js#n458
Aug 31 14:43:30 <feaneron>	hergertme: when I upstreamed max-content-height, I made sure that it'd work as before
Aug 31 14:43:39 <hergertme>	yeah i thought so too feaneron
Aug 31 14:43:52 <hergertme>	i think it was during the process to fixup the hfw or wfh stuff maybe?
Aug 31 14:44:01 <hergertme>	i dont remember what happened in that final cycle of changes
Aug 31 14:44:29 <feaneron>	i think it was the reworked sizing code of GtkScrolledWindow, which landed right after the new property
Aug 31 14:44:52 <baedert>	yes, the natural content size
Aug 31 14:45:10 <baedert>	max-content-height is completely unrelated to this
Aug 31 14:46:05 <djb>	there's a patch for mch here https://git.gnome.org/browse/polari/commit/src/userList.js?id=aa023a8c3c2b84705b91535f08795ccd3954aef4
Aug 31 14:48:30 <hergertme>	ah okay
Aug 31 14:48:46 <mclasen>	the behavior is going to change back to what it was in 3.20
Aug 31 14:49:07 <feaneron>	great news
Aug 31 14:51:00 <djb>	i've not followed the changes very closely; how do you mean?
Aug 31 14:56:32 <djb>	also GTK+ 3.21 makes Tweak Tool absolutely balloon in size lmao
Aug 31 14:59:58 <mclasen>	same issue
Aug 31 15:01:37 <djb>	ah yeah, via the ScrolledWindow on the Extensions page i'm guessing
Aug 31 15:01:40 <djb>	thanks
Aug 31 15:03:00 <djb>	so that's what's being reverted?
Aug 31 15:03:08 <mclasen>	nothing
Aug 31 15:04:08 <djb>	so what was this about? "the behavior is going to change back to what it was in 3.20"
Aug 31 15:04:48 <baedert>	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=766569
Aug 31 15:04:49 <bugbot>	Bug 766569: Widget: GtkScrolledWindow, enhancement, gtkdev, REOPENED , Better size requisition for GTK_SCROLL_NATURAL children
Aug 31 15:06:04 <djb>	thanks
Aug 31 15:08:23 <djb>	great option to have, as i've already needed to propagate it manually in the past, but yeah, better as an option
Aug 31 15:08:29 <bugbot>	mclasen@redhat.com changed the Status on bug 766569 from REOPENED --- to RESOLVED FIXED.
Aug 31 15:08:29 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=766569 Widget: GtkScrolledWindow, enhancement, gtkdev, RESOLVED FIXED, Better size requisition for GTK_SCROLL_NATURAL children
Aug 31 15:13:07 <lone_wolf>	Does a GtkScrolledWindow's hadjustment get automatically destroyed when the scrolled window is destroyed?
Aug 31 15:13:56 <djb>	all internal widgets like that do, unless you specifically ref them
Aug 31 15:14:09 <djb>	...which is probably not allowed anyway(?)
Aug 31 15:14:22 <feaneron>	is there a reliable way to send signals between threads?
Aug 31 15:14:47 <djb>	std::future :D </troll>
Aug 31 15:15:13 <baedert>	"signals between threads"?
Aug 31 15:15:43 <feaneron>	An object in thread X sends a signals that another object in thread Y listens to
Aug 31 15:16:19 <lone_wolf>	Ah, makes sense. I was wondering why GTK_IS_OBJECT(hadjustment) failed after destroying the window.
Aug 31 15:17:09 <mclasen>	feaneron: objects are not associated to threads in gobject...
Aug 31 15:17:20 <djb>	actually i guess you must be allowed to ref() the adjustments, since you might be sharing them with other widgets
Aug 31 15:17:49 <feaneron>	mclasen: so sending emiting a signal in the middle of a g_task_run_in_thread() is safe?
Aug 31 15:18:00 <djb>	and vice-versa, you can set_hadjustment() on an adjustment that's already being used elsewhere, and the ScrolledWindow shouldn't destroy that. so it's just standard ref counting
Aug 31 15:18:28 <baedert>	if it's your own signal, you might have to make sure it's run in the main thread yourself
Aug 31 15:18:33 <lone_wolf>	So it's basically like garbage collection.
Aug 31 15:18:45 <djb>	lone_wolf: but yeah, if you haven't done either of those, then the ScrolledWindow holds the sole reference, so it'll destroy the adjustment when it's disposed
Aug 31 15:18:59 <feaneron>	lone_wolf: it's basically ~not~ gc :)
Aug 31 15:19:38 <djb>	reference counting is one possible implementation of gc, but they're orthogonal
Aug 31 15:20:49 <lone_wolf>	Yes, that's true.
Aug 31 15:21:45 <lone_wolf>	Do I have to call gtk_scrolled_window_set_hadjustment() every time I modify the hadjustment, or does GTK automatically update the scrolled window when it's adjustment is modified?
Aug 31 15:22:02 <baedert>	the latter
Aug 31 15:22:23 <djb>	yeah, it all syncs for you
Aug 31 15:22:49 <baedert>	if you use gtk3, you can even use one adjustment for multiple scrolled windows
Aug 31 15:23:28 <djb>	e.g. create an adjustment, then a Scale and a ScrolledWindow, then set_hadjustment(it) for them both - then do some set_value()s and enjoy the show
Aug 31 15:24:35 <djb>	gtk3-widget-factory has some Scales synced in this way
Aug 31 15:25:33 <mclasen>	feaneron: that really depends on the signal and the handler
Aug 31 15:25:50 <djb>	uh, speaking of which... is it intentional that for the horizontal Scale there, the smooth autoscrolling gets faster as you hold and move the cursor further away VERTICALLY
Aug 31 15:26:21 <djb>	and conversely for the vscale, horizontally
Aug 31 15:30:16 <djb>	nvm, course it is: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770313#c8
Aug 31 15:30:17 <bugbot>	Bug 770313: Widget: GtkRange, normal, gtk-bugs, REOPENED , Scale/Range: right-click is broken: should/previously did change value by page increment, doesn't anymore
Aug 31 15:39:07 <lone_wolf>	How would I add a GtkDrawingArea to a GtkScrolledWindow if I want to scroll the drawing area manually when drawing to it?
Aug 31 15:40:04 <lone_wolf>	gtk_container_add() gives a warning, and tells me to use gtk_scrolled_window_add_with_viewport() instead, but I shouldn't need a viewport for this.
Aug 31 15:40:42 <djb>	This container accepts a single child widget. It adds scrollbars to the child widget and optionally draws a beveled frame around the child widget. The scrolled window can work in two ways:
Aug 31 15:40:46 <djb>	    Some widgets have native scrolling support; these widgets handle certain Gtk::Adjustment signals. Widgets with native scroll support include Gtk::TreeView, Gtk::TextView, and Gtk::Layout.
Aug 31 15:40:47 <djb>	    For widgets that lack native scrolling support, such as Gtk::Grid, Gtk::Box, and so on, the widget will be placed inside a Gtk::Viewport.
Aug 31 15:41:05 <djb>	that'll be why (gtkmm docs but it's just a find/replace)
Aug 31 15:42:11 <djb>	the DrawingArea wouldn't handle e.g. mouse scroll events on its own
Aug 31 15:50:21 <djb>	mclasen: the ScrolledWindow patch on bz wasn't marked as committed. should it be? i have unexplained ticket editing powers so can do it if you want, but am not sure why i have those... heh
Aug 31 15:50:35 <mclasen>	it doesn't matter
Aug 31 15:51:05 <mclasen>	the bug is closed, thats the important bit
Aug 31 15:51:21 <djb>	yeah, cool

Aug 31 16:45:41 <bugbot>	christian@hergert.me changed the Component on bug 770676 from general to Themes.
Aug 31 16:45:41 <bugbot>	christian@hergert.me changed the Product on bug 770676 from gnome-builder to gtk+.
Aug 31 16:45:41 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770676 Themes, normal, gtk-bugs, NEW , corner is still round when tiling on the right of left side
Aug 31 17:46:34 <lone_wolf>	What signal is triggered when the handle of a GtkScrollbar is dragged?
Aug 31 17:47:30 <djb>	https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkRange.html#GtkRange-value-changed
Aug 31 17:47:56 <djb>	Scrollbar is a subclass of Range, so it works like anything else with an Adjustment
Aug 31 17:49:04 <djb>	or do you mean dragging only? then you'd be in this foreboding territory: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-drag-begin
Aug 31 17:49:25 <lone_wolf>	I tried value-changed, but my callback doesn't get called.
Aug 31 17:50:00 <djb>	try change-value maybe https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkRange.html#GtkRange-change-value
Aug 31 17:50:06 <lone_wolf>	Never mind, it's a bug in my code.
Aug 31 17:50:08 <djb>	(handily very easily confused names)
Aug 31 18:11:36 <norbert>	hi all
Aug 31 18:11:45 <norbert>	since some of you helped me with info the last couple of weeks
Aug 31 18:11:59 <norbert>	I just wanted to let you know that I've released a new version of gtkgo
Aug 31 18:12:00 <norbert>	http://www.norbertdejonge.nl/gtkgo/
Aug 31 18:12:08 <norbert>	I hadn't worked on it for more than 17 years
Aug 31 18:12:21 <norbert>	so I had to migrate it from GTK+ 1.2 to GTK+ 3.18, among other things
Aug 31 18:12:53 <feaneron>	norbert: awsome!!!!!
Aug 31 18:13:04 <norbert>	:)
Aug 31 18:13:11 <feaneron>	norbert: can I share this news with the GNOME community on Google+?
Aug 31 18:13:26 <norbert>	err, I have no social media accounts
Aug 31 18:13:38 <feaneron>	do you mind if I do it?
Aug 31 18:13:43 <norbert>	sure, go ahead
Aug 31 18:13:46 <feaneron>	people need to know about it!
Aug 31 18:14:22 <norbert>	there are still some ancient pages about the program here and there, like this https://archive.debian.net/sarge/gnome/gtkgo
Aug 31 18:14:39 <norbert>	a long, long time ago it was in the repos
Aug 31 18:15:40 <norbert>	anyway, I learned a lot migrating the thing, about signals and callbacks for instance
