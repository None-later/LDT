Jul 25 20:03:37 <Creak>	hi!
Jul 25 20:04:10 <Creak>	I'd like to do this kind of layout, but I don't know what's the best way to achieve this: https://www.reddit.com/r/GTK/comments/4ulncl/gtkdev_best_way_to_achieve_this_layout/
Jul 25 20:05:03 <Creak>	my main problem is the width of the cells. First the Grid has to take the whole window, which doesn't seem to work :/
Jul 25 20:05:16 <Creak>	then the two panes must be of the same width

Jul 25 20:05:34 <Creak>	I simply don't know how to achieve that kind of layout

Jul 25 20:40:37 <Company>	Creak: i assume you're not using a scrolledwindow for managing the scrollbar?
Jul 25 20:42:26 <Company>	Creak: because then the answer is to put the 2 text panes into a grid with column-homogeneous = true and then put the grid and the scrollbar into a box
Jul 25 20:46:10 <Creak>	the problem would be for the headers and footers, they must be respectively above and under each pane, but the scrollbar on the right should be the size of the pane without the header and footer
Jul 25 20:46:45 <Creak>	otherwise the scrollbar would seem to include these components which would be quite strange
Jul 25 20:47:21 <Creak>	I tested with a Gtk.Grid and setting the pane to hexpand
Jul 25 20:48:00 <Creak>	it seems to work, but the problem I'm afraid of is that I don't know if both pane will keep the same width all the time
Jul 25 21:35:53 <Creak>	I've got another question. Say you're doing a special widget that is basically an HBox but with specific buttons for your app. Is it better to derive your class from Gtk.Widget and then add an Gtk.HBox or to derive directly from HBox?
Jul 25 21:48:14 <benwaffle>	Creak: you should use Gtk.Box instead of VBox and HBox
Jul 25 21:50:09 <Creak>	yup, I'm already using it, but it was just the habit ;)
Jul 25 22:06:15 <Creak>	my problem now is that my headerbar is taking too much space when the label in it is too long... how can I fix the label width?
Jul 25 22:07:13 <hergertme>	set max-width-chars to something reasonable and/or ellipsize = PANGO_ELLIPSIZE_*
Jul 25 22:21:08 <Creak>	I set ellipsize to MIDDLE, but it didn't change
Jul 25 22:21:16 <Creak>	I'll try max-width-charws
Jul 25 22:23:44 <Creak>	nope... doesn't work...
Jul 25 22:24:22 <Creak>	urgh that's so frustrating to be that close to something that works exactly how you'd expect!
Jul 25 22:55:38 <Creak>	Should I use the "map" or "map-event" signals to prevent my Grid to allocate too much space to the first row cells?
Jul 25 23:30:04 <Creak>	here is an example: http://pastebin.com/P75agP9T
Jul 25 23:32:58 <Creak>	I'd like button1 and button2 to be the same width, and label1 to be the same width as button1. But there, since label1 is way larger than both button1, label1 wins and it is setting the width for the whole column
Jul 26 00:08:39 <Creak>	Found the solution!!! you were right hergertme, I just didn't know how to use these functions. I just have to call label1.set_max_width_chars(1) and label1.set_ellipsize(Pango.EllipsizeMode.START)
Jul 26 00:09:25 <Creak>	this way the cell doesn't get an impossible width
Jul 26 02:28:25 <rishi>	Shouldn't the example my-app-label.c for a derivable class use G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE instead of G_DEFINE_TYPE?
Jul 26 02:28:34 <rishi>	I mean in https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/SubclassGObject
Jul 26 02:39:35 <rishi>	It is even worse.  G_DECLARE_DERIVABLE_TYPE doesn't generate the typedef for MyAppLabelPrivate.
Jul 26 02:39:43 <rishi>	(Why doesn't it do that?)
Jul 26 02:40:11 <rishi>	That means struct _MyAppLabelPrivate needs to be somehow typedef-ed to MyAppLabelPrivate.
Jul 26 03:00:31 <tristan>	rishi, I think that the standard for some years has become to not include a ->priv pointer on the public struct (since the lookup for private data has since become pointer arithmetic)
Jul 26 03:00:58 <tristan>	so you should not need a private struct typedef in the header (where the G_DECLARE_ stuff goes)
Jul 26 03:24:01 <ricotz>	ebassi, hi, a minor graphene issue https://paste.debian.net/plain/785287
Jul 26 03:41:56 <rishi>	tristan: Ok, but the HowDoI is still wrong.

Jul 26 05:36:09 <ebassi>	rudrab: But, in general, you cannot expect stuff to just be sequential in an event-driven GUI toolkit. This is not a console program.

Jul 26 07:36:29 <feborges>	is there a good reason why gtk_button_set_label always creates a new label instead of checking whether it already has one and gtk_label_set_label (GTK_LABEL (gtk_bin_get_child (GTK_BIN (button)... ?

Jul 26 07:38:55 <mclasen>	if you want to control the label widget, set a label widget, and operate on that
Jul 26 07:38:56 <slaf>	thumbnail: if it's a GObject, it's ref-counted so g_object_unref

Jul 26 08:02:34 <The_gull>	is there a way to remove/add multiple children “at the same time” (not causing redraws) to a container ?
Jul 26 08:04:09 <mclasen>	there is no redraw between two calls of container_remove that you do in a row
Jul 26 08:05:16 <The_gull>	mh, that’s good then, thanks :·)
Jul 26 08:06:35 <rudrab>	or i should just call the function inside the if loop as:

Jul 26 08:48:44 <hotcfoch>	is it just enough with defining a propert with g_value_set_uint64 in C, if I want hat property being read as an int in Python?
Jul 26 08:50:38 <feaneron>	i think so
Jul 26 08:51:04 <feaneron>	if python implicitly knows about the unsigned situation of the int

Jul 26 11:34:03 <feaneron>	hi guys, why am I consistently always receiving a <Meta> key in Wayland?
Jul 26 11:34:35 <feaneron>	whenever I check for the key presses, there's this stray <Meta> modified, and I have no idea where does it come from
Jul 26 11:40:15 <mclasen>	not  a stray key, just a stray modifier
Jul 26 11:40:44 <mclasen>	probably due to the fact that meta is colocated with some other modifier
Jul 26 11:41:02 <mclasen>	if wayland hadn't inherited xkb from X, the world would be a better place...
Jul 26 11:41:15 <feaneron>	shall I fill a bug for that?
Jul 26 11:41:34 <mclasen>	no, why ?
Jul 26 11:44:20 <feaneron>	because that modifier shouldn't be there. Or should it?
Jul 26 11:44:55 *	jjongsma_ is now known as jjongsma
Jul 26 11:45:24 <mclasen>	it being there is a reflection of the xkb configuration, if my assumption is correct
Jul 26 11:45:45 <mclasen>	you could debug this some more, certainly
Jul 26 11:46:09 <jjongsma>	ebassi, any chance you have a little time to talk about a regression we have in spice-gtk caused by https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=2c7b21718f18ab743cd79784ae28cad582f58503
Jul 26 11:46:17 <mclasen>	but I'm a fan of filing bugs only _after_ the debugging, as a holder for the patch that resulted from the debugging
Jul 26 11:47:35 <jjongsma>	or, if ebassi's not around, anyone else? :)
Jul 26 11:49:29 <mclasen>	without seeing more than "regression" hard to say
Jul 26 11:50:22 *	KaL_out is now known as KaL
Jul 26 11:50:34 <jmd>	The documentation for g_simple_action_set_enable says that it should never be called by users.  So why bother putting it in the public API?
Jul 26 11:51:04 <jjongsma>	mclasen, indeed, that's why I want to talk to somebody about it.
Jul 26 11:51:17 <jjongsma>	the regression is that it fails to redraw until we resize the window
Jul 26 11:51:39 <mclasen>	jmd: so other libraries can call it
Jul 26 11:51:47 <jjongsma>	and I'm digging into gtk to figure out what the difference is here and what might have caused the change.
Jul 26 11:51:49 *	mclasen reboots
Jul 26 11:51:57 <rishi>	jmd: In this case, the 'users' of an action are not the users of the GLib API.
Jul 26 11:52:17 <rishi>	The users are those who are proxying or activating the action.
Jul 26 11:52:51 <rishi>	The implementor is the one who actually handles 'activate' and does what the action is supposed to do.
Jul 26 11:54:02 <ebassi>	jjongsma: I'm going to have a couple of meeting in about 10 minutes, so I'll be available only later
Jul 26 11:54:21 <jjongsma>	ebassi, can you ping me when you're avaialble?
Jul 26 11:54:24 <ebassi>	jjongsma: But I remember talking about this with somebody else in the spice team
Jul 26 11:54:32 <jjongsma>	yeah, fidencio 
Jul 26 11:54:37 <ebassi>	jjongsma: Right
Jul 26 11:55:00 <jmd>	rishi: Well I think it is confusing.  I just spent two days trying to figure out how to enable/disable an action - I saw that when I first started looking - but discounted it because of that sentence.
Jul 26 11:55:20 <ebassi>	jjongsma: That commit was partially reverted by the fix for Firefox; if you're tripping up on current master then it means spice-gtk is doing something weird and not guaranteed to work
Jul 26 11:55:52 <rishi>	jmd: Agreed.
Jul 26 11:55:56 <ebassi>	jjongsma: But since I don't know spice-gtk, nor I have time to deal with it, last time I spoke with fidencio I asked for at least understanding what spice-gtk even does
Jul 26 11:56:19 <jjongsma>	ebassi, sure, I'm just trying to figure out what this "something weird" might be and how to fix it.
Jul 26 11:56:47 <jjongsma>	so I'm digging into gtk+ to figure out where we might be violating expectations but haven't come up with anything so far. So I was hoping to just discuss it a bit.
Jul 26 11:57:52 <ebassi>	jjongsma: The commit that you want to look at is: fc569f1ac6ff108afc17f7f439480273826af3a6
Jul 26 11:58:10 <ebassi>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=fc569f1ac6ff108afc17f7f439480273826af3a6
Jul 26 11:59:53 <ebassi>	jjongsma: That commit moves what GtkWidget used to do with double-buffering into GdkWindow — i.e. create a new buffer if the window is a top-level and a native window
Jul 26 12:00:16 <ebassi>	jjongsma: If you've disabled double buffering, everything should be back to normal
Jul 26 12:00:23 <ebassi>	jjongsma: Is spice-gtk double-buffering?
Jul 26 12:00:42 <ebassi>	jjongsma: If it isn't, is it relying on being able to create random cairo_t's on random GdkWindows?
Jul 26 12:00:55 <ebassi>	jjongsma: How does spice-gtk even draw?
Jul 26 12:01:06 <ebassi>	Those are the questions I asked fidencio 
Jul 26 12:01:53 <jjongsma>	double-buffering: yes, creating random cairo_t's: no
Jul 26 12:01:57 <jjongsma>	ebassi, ^
Jul 26 12:02:29 <jjongsma>	ebassi, we draw by connecting to the draw signal and drawing in the provided cairo_t
Jul 26 12:02:55 <jjongsma>	ebassi, the main difference (in gtk+) that I see in the commit that caused the regression is that an expose event previously resulted in a call to gtk_widget_begin_draw_internal(), but after the change, it only calls this function for toplevel GdkWindows.  But I don't know enough to know whether that's relevant to anything.
Jul 26 12:03:31 <ebassi>	jjongsma: Nothing should be relying on expose events in GTK+ 3.x
Jul 26 12:04:00 <ebassi>	jjongsma: In any case, since everything else seems to be working except spice-gtk, I doubt spice-gtk is "just" drawing on the provided cairo_t
Jul 26 12:05:04 <jjongsma>	ebassi, what does "relying on expose events" mean? We don't handle them at all in our application, but they still result in gtk_widget_render() to be called
Jul 26 12:05:51 <ebassi>	Then I fail to understand how spice-gtk is breaking
Jul 26 12:06:23 <jjongsma>	ebassi, for what it's worth, here's our draw function: https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-gtk/tree/src/spice-widget-cairo.c#n65
Jul 26 12:06:23 <ebassi>	The commit I linked added a constraint on what can be double-buffered — top-level, native GdkWindow
Jul 26 12:07:07 <jjongsma>	hmm
Jul 26 12:08:03 <ebassi>	This seems to contradict your "we're double-buffering" statement: https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-gtk/tree/src/spice-widget-cairo.c#n87
Jul 26 12:09:46 <jjongsma>	ebassi, it does seem to contradict it, but the comment is old, I think: https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-gtk/tree/src/spice-widget.c#n605
Jul 26 12:11:05 <baedert>	What's with line 1208 in that file?
Jul 26 12:14:54 <jjongsma>	well, there's a bit of an experimental egl widget as an alternative to the cairo implementation, but that's not being used
Jul 26 12:15:21 <jjongsma>	so enabled is false, which results in double-buffering being enabled.
Jul 26 12:25:48 <mclasen>	jjongsma: sorry, fell off for  a bit
Jul 26 12:25:50 <mclasen>	back now
Jul 26 12:31:44 <jjongsma>	mclasen, well, ebassi showed up briefly
Jul 26 12:34:54 <ebassi>	jjongsma: So, I guess the question is not "stuff fails to draw" but "stuff fails to invalidate the contents of the widget"
Jul 26 12:35:35 <jjongsma>	ebassi, perhaps
Jul 26 12:38:19 <jjongsma>	ebassi, but why would reverting the expose event changes affect that?
Jul 26 12:39:39 <ebassi>	jjongsma: I have no idea
Jul 26 12:41:03 <jjongsma>	ebassi, I must admit that I have a very limited understanding about GdkWindows, and how they relate to GtkWidgets, etc. What makes a GdkWindow a toplevel window?
Jul 26 12:41:20 <ebassi>	jjongsma: The code in gtk_widget_render() is the logical equivalent of what gtkmain.c was doing. What really changed is the code in GdkWindow
Jul 26 12:42:31 <jjongsma>	ebassi, well, it's very very close to the same. But as I said before, there's one difference I can see: the old implementation called gdk_window_begin_paint_region(), which calls gdk_window_begin_paint_internal()
Jul 26 12:42:56 <jjongsma>	ebassi, the new implementation calls gdk-window_begin_draw_frame(), which only calls gdk_window_begin_paint_internal() IF the GdkWindow is a toplevel
Jul 26 12:43:15 <ebassi>	Yes, that's what I said
Jul 26 12:43:37 <jjongsma>	which is why I asked the question above about toplevel GdkWindows
Jul 26 12:45:20 <ebassi>	jjongsma: Right, but, as I said, nothing expects an expose event on a child GdkWindow, these days; that's why I asked if Spice-gtk is using expose events
Jul 26 12:47:15 <ebassi>	Only top-level windows should receive expose events, and trip the redraw; child widgets should draw on the parent's buffer.
Jul 26 12:50:43 <jjongsma>	ebassi, thanks for your patience, I'm slowly getting a better understanding here...
Jul 26 12:53:52 <ebassi>	jjongsma: No problem
Jul 26 12:54:56 <ebassi>	We can tweak the conditions, after all I did that for Firefox; but I want to understand what are the requirements — and if spice-gtk can be changed, in case
Jul 26 12:55:48 <ebassi>	Also because when we break API for 4.0, we're going to pick stricter semantics
Jul 26 12:56:05 <jjongsma>	ebassi, yep. I'll continue to investigate here. I may ask additional questions from time to time
Jul 26 12:56:40 <jjongsma>	at the moment I think I need to try a few things out before I have anything intelligent to say.
Jul 26 12:57:11 <ebassi>	jjongsma: No worries
Jul 26 13:00:59 <jjongsma>	ebassi, another odd thing (in case it triggers any ideas in your mind) is that sometimes after resizing the window, it updates for a few seconds before freezing again...
Jul 26 13:01:47 <jjongsma>	I suspect that's something related to spice-gtk code, but just in case, I thought I'd mention it.
Jul 26 13:05:32 <ebassi>	Doesn't ring a bell
Jul 26 13:06:04 <ebassi>	But, maybe, something is checking the size of the cairo surface used to render the content, and if the size is the same then the widget does not get invalidated
Jul 26 13:06:22 <ebassi>	While you're getting resizing notifications, the surface gets redrawn

Jul 26 13:47:06 <mwleeds>	ebassi: Is there any reason there's not a function json_node_get_path (JsonNode* n) that returns a (unique) JsonPath to the node?
Jul 26 13:54:45 *	dpm-afk is now known as dpm
Jul 26 13:59:18 <ebassi>	mwleeds: If you have the node, why do you need the path?
Jul 26 13:59:30 <ebassi>	JsonPath is pretty much XmlPath - a query API
Jul 26 14:02:15 <mwleeds>	because I want to see if there's a node in another json tree at the same path
Jul 26 14:02:27 <mwleeds>	and if so, replace it
Jul 26 14:10:59 <ebassi>	It would be possible to write a json_path_create_for_node(), but the main reason why it does not exist is we can only guarantee parent-child relationship in a JsonNode tree if it comes from a JsonParser
Jul 26 14:11:18 <ebassi>	i.e. it's not always possible to take a node and retrieve its parent
Jul 26 14:13:13 <iulianradu>	Figured it out
Jul 26 14:13:51 <mwleeds>	we could return NULL in that case
Jul 26 14:14:09 <mwleeds>	but anyway I think I found another way in my situation

Jul 26 15:44:03 <gasuleg>	Hi, I created a GAction and I want know when his state change. Any idea?
Jul 26 15:45:32 <jmd>	gasuleg: Well you created it so you should know!!!
Jul 26 15:46:37 <jmd>	GAction is an interface.
Jul 26 15:47:26 <gasuleg>	jmd, well, I change his state in a class but I want to know when he changes in another
Jul 26 15:48:30 <jmd>	emit a signal, and connect to that signal.
Jul 26 15:50:37 <gasuleg>	jmd, I created this GAction to avoid using an emit signal because I don't know the instance where I change the state of GAction
Jul 26 15:51:20 <jmd>	So how _do_ you change its state?
Jul 26 15:51:50 <jmd>	In the bit of code where its state changes, just emit the signal there.  What is the problem?
Jul 26 15:52:09 <gasuleg>	don't need the instance to change state: g_action_change_state 
Jul 26 15:52:29 <gasuleg>	g_action_change_state (GAction *action,
Jul 26 15:52:29 <gasuleg>	                       GVariant *value);
Jul 26 15:53:58 <jmd>	gasuleg: Right.  .... and what have you got in the implementation of GActionInterface->change_state ??
Jul 26 15:56:08 <gasuleg>	jmd, http://pastebin.com/sV2STDbN
Jul 26 15:56:31 <gasuleg>	display_smartinfo is the name of my GAction
Jul 26 15:56:50 <jmd>	Please answer my question.
Jul 26 15:57:11 <jmd>	What does your GActionInterface->change_state function have ?
Jul 26 15:57:51 <gasuleg>	just boolean
Jul 26 15:58:01 <gasuleg>	(not sure to understand)
Jul 26 15:58:02 <jmd>	Huh?
Jul 26 15:58:08 <jmd>	It should be a function
Jul 26 15:59:04 <jmd>	You said that you created a GAction.  So how did you create it?
Jul 26 15:59:35 <jmd>	If you created it, then you must know when and under what circumstances it changes state.
Jul 26 16:00:14 <jmd>	So, when it changes state, emit a signal.  Then everything which is interested in that state change can connect to the signal.
Jul 26 16:03:33 <gasuleg>	as, I say I change his state in a method of a class where I don't know the instance. I created it like that : http://pastebin.com/EhTkJjim

Jul 26 16:10:45 <jmd>	Right.  See the 5th member of GActionEntry?  It is the change_state function pointer.
Jul 26 16:10:54 <jmd>	Use that pointer to emit a signal.

Jul 26 16:13:23 <jmd>	Actually I don't know what your {0
Jul 26 16:13:41 <jmd>	{0} things are for.  Your code probably crashes?
Jul 26 16:14:30 <gasuleg>	jmd, I work on a free software code, so I just add display_smartinfo line
Jul 26 16:14:50 <gasuleg>	this code work
Jul 26 16:15:03 <gasuleg>	but I don't understand everything
Jul 26 16:15:05 <jmd>	I suggest you got lucky then.
Jul 26 16:15:38 <jmd>	GActionEntry contains 5 pointers.  But you seem to be forcing 6 into it.
Jul 26 16:16:59 <jmd>	Anyway, to answer your original question.  Implement the change_state member.
Jul 26 16:17:29 <jmd>	Note that the documentation says "All stateful actions should provide a handler here".
Jul 26 16:17:42 <jmd>	You have provided no handler.
Jul 26 16:17:56 <gasuleg>	jmd, if I understand its a callback, so i can write the methode i want
Jul 26 16:18:04 <jmd>	sure.
Jul 26 16:18:25 <gasuleg>	ok ok, I see
Jul 26 16:18:27 <gasuleg>	cool
Jul 26 16:18:42 <gasuleg>	thank you jmd for all your help
Jul 26 16:18:47 <gasuleg>	I will try that

Jul 26 16:24:00 <jmd>	gasuleg: Right.  An interesting project. (but I've never yet met anyone who has succeeded building it).
Jul 26 16:25:05 <gasuleg>	jmd, why did you said that?
Jul 26 16:25:42 <jmd>	Most people (including myself) give up in frustration after a few days (weeks) trying.
Jul 26 16:26:40 <gasuleg>	I have an issue again. Can you have a seen on it? http://pastebin.com/axTi6V3y
Jul 26 16:26:56 <gasuleg>	error: �test� was not declared in this scope
Jul 26 16:27:38 <gasuleg>	well, I build it, what is your issue jmd ?
Jul 26 16:28:46 <jmd>	Well you have a symbol 'test'.  The compiler is complaining that there is no such symbol.
Jul 26 16:28:59 <jmd>	line 11
Jul 26 16:29:28 <gasuleg>	yeah, but i creat the method l16
Jul 26 16:29:37 <jmd>	(you still have those {0} there, so I wouldn't expect this code to do anything sensible).
Jul 26 16:29:52 <jmd>	Probably gives lots of compiler warnings?
Jul 26 16:30:12 <gasuleg>	no one or they are hide
Jul 26 16:31:26 <gasuleg>	I will tell the question to the creator about these {0}
Jul 26 16:35:15 <gasuleg>	jmd, we are agree I need to call my method test like that if I have GActionEntry with with elements
Jul 26 16:35:23 <gasuleg>	5 elements*
Jul 26 16:39:33 <gasuleg>	jmd,  ring_actions is an array of GActionEntrys... iirc the compiler gives some warning if you don't put the null at the end of each individual entry
Jul 26 16:40:14 <jmd>	I would expect it to give a warning if you DO put those there.
Jul 26 16:40:34 <jmd>	Even if it doesn't it'll almost certainly crash if you try running it.
Jul 26 16:41:25 <jmd>	That array has 36 pointers in it.
Jul 26 16:41:49 <jmd>	However a GArrayEntry is 5 pointers each.
Jul 26 16:42:17 <jmd>	So what you have there is an array of 5.2 GArrayEntrys.
Jul 26 16:42:28 <jmd>	The .2 is going to cause problems ...

Jul 27 05:54:33 <hramrach>	Hello
Jul 27 05:54:44 <hramrach>	how do I change colors of the default gtk3 theme?
Jul 27 05:55:33 <hramrach>	I tried to copy the gtk-default.css to gtk.css in a theme directory but I lose most 3d appearance of widgets
Jul 27 05:55:57 <hramrach>	My own old theme and themes installed from gnome-look also have this problem
Jul 27 06:06:02 <ebassi>	hramrach: You don't. The only way to change colors is to create a new theme.
Jul 27 06:06:47 <ebassi>	This is not something new: only the Clearlooks engine allowed you to select colors, in gtk2
Jul 27 06:08:34 <hramrach>	so how do you create new theme?
Jul 27 06:09:03 <benzea>	ebassi: that was a GTK+ feature! it worked for all engines except pixmap :)
Jul 27 06:09:05 <hramrach>	presumably copying the get-default.css to gtk.css in a tehme directory creates a new theme but it's missing 3d elements
Jul 27 06:09:22 <hramrach>	*gtk-default
Jul 27 06:09:52 <baedert>	what's get-default.css and what are 3d elements?
Jul 27 06:10:14 <hramrach>	gtk-default
Jul 27 06:10:26 <benzea>	3d elements would be making the base color darker/lighter for gradients, I presume

Jul 27 06:14:07 <hramrach>	there is some difference between the two
Jul 27 06:14:55 <ebassi>	hramrach: So, you're copying Adwaita?
Jul 27 06:15:05 <hramrach>	Raleigh
Jul 27 06:15:31 <hramrach>	but anything goes
Jul 27 06:15:48 <hramrach>	if copying Adwaita is supposed to work I will copy that instead, whatever
Jul 27 06:15:50 <ebassi>	I'm not really sure Raleigh is even up to date
Jul 27 06:16:02 <ebassi>	Anyway, from where are you copying the CSS?
Jul 27 06:16:07 <ebassi>	From the Git repository?
Jul 27 06:16:18 <hramrach>	from Debian package
Jul 27 06:16:24 <heftig>	I think you could use this to get a complete copy of the integrated themes:
Jul 27 06:16:26 <heftig>	gresource list /usr/lib/libgtk-3.so | while read f; do f2=${f#/org/gtk/libgtk/}; [[ $f2 == theme/* ]] || continue; mkdir -p $(dirname $f2); gresource extract /usr/lib/libgtk-3.so $f > $f2; done
Jul 27 06:17:03 <ebassi>	hramrach: CSS files shipped by GTK are part of the shared library; if you look at the files on disk, you'll notice that they are empty
Jul 27 06:17:11 <ebassi>	Unless you're using an ancient version of GTK
Jul 27 06:17:27 <hramrach>	the sauce package
Jul 27 06:17:51 <hramrach>	gresource does not know what to do with libgtk
Jul 27 06:18:30 <hramrach>	it's in arch directory
Jul 27 06:18:42 <hramrach>	will try looking at that
Jul 27 06:20:55 <hramrach>	hm, same
Jul 27 06:20:58 <hramrach>	no change
Jul 27 06:21:18 <heftig>	ebassi: btw, what is the purpose of the gtk-contained*.css files that just get imported?
Jul 27 06:22:00 <hramrach>	there is only gtk.css in Raleigh and using that in place of the gtk-default.css gives the no-3d issue
Jul 27 06:22:35 <ebassi>	heftig: You'll have to ask Lapo
Jul 27 06:22:55 <ebassi>	heftig: I think it's just broken down so that scss can build from different mixins
Jul 27 06:23:09 <heftig>	hramrach: Raleigh is broken
Jul 27 06:24:05 <heftig>	hramrach: it was neglected after Adwaita became the default theme
Jul 27 06:25:24 <baedert>	I somehow remember multiple times where mclasen proposed to drop it
Jul 27 06:33:48 <ebassi>	I honestly thought we already did
Jul 27 08:56:57 <rudrab>	Hi, in a gtk3 application, I am trying to replace titlebar with headerbar
Jul 27 08:57:21 <baedert>	gtk_window_set_titlebar
Jul 27 08:57:27 <rudrab>	the only problem I am facing is I cant drag the window using titlebar
Jul 27 08:57:56 <rudrab>	is there any property I can set for that?
Jul 27 08:58:05 <baedert>	Are you using gtk_window_set_titlebar?
Jul 27 08:58:11 <rudrab>	yes
Jul 27 08:58:50 <baedert>	There is no such property; it just works if the titlebar child widget doesn't consume drags
Jul 27 08:59:36 <rudrab>	actually opposite: I have done Gtk.Window.set_decorated to False. So I dont actually have a titlebar, only headerbar
Jul 27 09:00:10 <baedert>	that's wrong
Jul 27 09:00:16 <ebassi>	rudrab: Use gtk_window_set_titlebar() with a GtkHeaderBar
Jul 27 09:00:24 <ebassi>	Otherwise stuff won't work
Jul 27 09:02:40 <rudrab>	ebassi: will not it display both titlebar and headerbar?
Jul 27 09:02:56 <rudrab>	I guess i have not understood you 
Jul 27 09:02:57 <baedert>	No
Jul 27 09:08:35 <rudrab>	ah...great...thank you both
Jul 27 09:19:30 <heftig>	hm, why is g_unix_signal_source_new limited to a subset of signals?
Jul 27 09:21:41 <hadess>	heftig, probably because it can't safely handle the others
Jul 27 09:22:20 <heftig>	I wonder why. I just need WINCH
Jul 27 09:22:25 <hadess>	catching SIGABRT or SIGSEGV is possible but probably not something you want in your app :)
Jul 27 09:23:04 <hadess>	heftig, probably something that could be added then
Jul 27 09:24:00 <heftig>	(more specifically, i'm trying to use prompt_toolkit + gbulb from python; the former tries to add a handler for SIGWINCH and the latter translates it to g_unix_signal_source_new)
Jul 27 09:32:46 <hramrach>	heftig: I extracted the whole Adwaita theme and moved it to my theme directory. No change. Switched to default theme and back. The theme is still broken in the same way.
Jul 27 09:35:02 <rudrab>	one more thing, in line of my previous question: can I place my menubar (created using Gtk.Builder) inside headerbar as well?
Jul 27 09:36:15 <ebassi>	rudrab: No
Jul 27 09:36:37 <ebassi>	For menus in header bars, you want a GtkMenuButton or similar

Jul 27 10:20:45 <mclasen>	see ebassi's question ^
Jul 27 10:22:07 <Company>	the scale factor is a property of the monitor you're rendering on
Jul 27 10:22:31 <Company>	or the window you're rendering into
Jul 27 10:22:39 <ebassi>	Right
Jul 27 10:23:10 <ebassi>	The issue is that render nodes may have rasterization operations in them, so the need to create a surface (that will then be pushed to GL)
Jul 27 10:23:46 <Company>	but they can query the scale factor for that, no?
Jul 27 10:23:47 <gasuleg>	I try to handle the signal change state (https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GSimpleAction.html#GSimpleAction-change-state) in my GActionEntry (https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GActionMap.html#GActionEntry ) to conect it to a method of an other class. any idea?
Jul 27 10:24:17 <ebassi>	Company: Well, they set the size of the node, which is used to create the surface/drawing context
Jul 27 10:24:31 <gasuleg>	I think it's easy to do but i'm really lost right now
Jul 27 10:24:32 <ebassi>	Company: So the question is
Jul 27 10:24:47 <Company>	i would imagine the scale factor setup happening on the viewport (is that the GL term) level
Jul 27 10:25:15 <ebassi>	Company: Do we add that scaling factor to the node, so that widgets can use the allocation when creating the node; or do we tell widgets to scale the allocation themselves when creating the node
Jul 27 10:25:30 <ebassi>	Company: Not really; you still need to render at a higher scaling factor
Jul 27 10:25:43 <ebassi>	Otherwise the Cairo surface will look like crap
Jul 27 10:25:55 <Company>	yes
Jul 27 10:26:06 <Company>	but the coordinates you use are always in user space
Jul 27 10:26:25 <Company>	ie they will be scaled automatically for you
Jul 27 10:26:38 <ebassi>	If they get scaled up, they will look like arse
Jul 27 10:27:03 <ebassi>	It's not like GL will automatically do things for you
Jul 27 10:27:06 <Company>	well, if you have to upload pixel data, you'll have to look at the scale factor

Jul 27 10:46:31 *	Now talking on #gtk+
Jul 27 10:46:31 *	Topic for #gtk+ is: #gtk+ is proud to announce its selection as the official IRC channel of the Toronto GTK+ Hackfest
Jul 27 10:46:31 *	Topic for #gtk+ set by Company (Mon Jun 13 12:40:28 2016)
Jul 27 10:46:46 <ebassi>	So it would tie it to the drawing operation
Jul 27 10:47:14 <Company>	in GTK, you just cairo_scale() it however you want
Jul 27 10:47:49 <Company>	but that will not cause us to update our textures (or relaod icon pixbufs)
Jul 27 10:48:27 <Company>	no idea if gsk allows any random transform to be applied before rendering
Jul 27 10:51:45 <ebassi>	No; you rasterise into a surface the untransformed contents, and then we apply the transformation when we composite the scene
Jul 27 10:52:04 <ebassi>	Basically, the way a get_render_node() implementation looks like is this: https://paste.gnome.org/pa702plia
Jul 27 10:52:21 <ebassi>	With the option, like alex wants, to save the rasterization across frames if nothing has changed
Jul 27 10:52:38 <ebassi>	If we put a texture cache in the middle
Jul 27 10:53:44 <ebassi>	(That code snippet is basically GtkBox, or any other container with a background)
Jul 27 10:57:34 <Company>	ebassi: so a render node doesn't know what it's rendered to?
Jul 27 10:58:21 <Company>	there doesn't seem to be any association between the node and the GdkDisplay or GdkWindow
Jul 27 10:58:39 <ebassi>	Company: The renderer takes a display, drawing context, and a root node
Jul 27 10:58:57 <ebassi>	Company: That happens at the end of the scene graph build
Jul 27 10:59:11 <Company>	but not the node?
Jul 27 10:59:52 <ebassi>	Not at the node level, no. In theory, you could pass the same tree to two different renderers tied to two different environments
Jul 27 11:00:11 <Company>	that seems bad
Jul 27 11:00:13 <ebassi>	We could turn it inside-out, and have the renderer create nodes
Jul 27 11:00:22 <ebassi>	(I already have a branch that does that)
Jul 27 11:00:29 <Company>	because it makes lots of things more complicated
Jul 27 11:00:39 <Company>	for a flexibility that you almost never use
Jul 27 11:01:06 <ebassi>	Yeah, that's pretty much the same conclusion I came to
Jul 27 11:01:24 <Company>	it's nice if you can render the node to a different renderer
Jul 27 11:01:42 <Company>	but I think a node should always "belong" to one renderer
Jul 27 11:02:01 <Company>	which would be where it gets scale factors etc from
Jul 27 11:02:04 <ebassi>	Yep
Jul 27 11:02:49 <ebassi>	Right, I'll just turn the render node creation inside out, and always ask the renderer to create a node - and it can set up things like scale factors
Jul 27 11:03:00 <Company>	right
Jul 27 11:03:19 <Company>	so there may be a gdk_render_node_get_scale_factor()
Jul 27 11:03:21 <ebassi>	And it makes it easier to create a free-list of render nodes, if the memory profile starts bothering us
Jul 27 11:03:40 <Company>	but all it should do is return gsk_renderer_get_scale_factor (node->priv->renderer);
Jul 27 11:03:46 <ebassi>	Yep
Jul 27 11:04:25 <baedert>	GskRenderNodeFactory!
Jul 27 11:04:32 <ebassi>	baedert: Haha
Jul 27 11:04:39 <ebassi>	Nah, just: gsk_renderer_create_render_node()
Jul 27 11:07:49 <lazka>	is there a way to adjust the pango layout/context of a widget?
Jul 27 11:08:41 <lazka>	I'd like to disable auto bidir in GtkLabel
Jul 27 11:10:17 <heftig>	Cairo is one of GSK's backends?
Jul 27 11:10:30 <mclasen>	garnacho_: hmm; I merged my code to set up all-scroll cursors for when you use the nipple to scroll; but I am occasionally seeing that cursor getting stuck - I guess I'm missing some ways in which the scrolling can end. could you double-check that code in gtkscrolledwindow.c for what I'm missing ?
Jul 27 11:13:24 <garnacho_>	mclasen: wayland?
Jul 27 11:13:40 <mclasen>	now that you mention it, yes
Jul 27 11:14:20 <ebassi>	heftig: Yes; mostly for debugging.
Jul 27 11:14:29 <garnacho_>	aha... that's fishy :)
Jul 27 11:15:01 <ebassi>	heftig: And for macOS, since that GDK backend still does not have OpenGL support
Jul 27 11:16:31 <heftig>	So the actual backends would be OpenGL and pixman?
Jul 27 11:17:34 <heftig>	Or always GL and then software rendering if needed?
Jul 27 11:19:11 <ebassi>	heftig: Always GL, for compositing, and Cairo/pixman for rasterizations
Jul 27 11:19:47 <ebassi>	i.e. widgets draw components on Cairo image surfaces and then we blend them together in a GL scene
Jul 27 11:19:59 <ebassi>	Until we can move more bits to the GPU
Jul 27 11:20:30 <heftig>	So e.g. text rendering is unaffected by the current GSK move?
Jul 27 11:20:41 <ebassi>	Also, for backward compatibility, we still need to allow people to render on Cairo contexts
Jul 27 11:20:59 <ebassi>	heftig: Text rendering is still pretty much a rasterization, so yes: it's not moved to the GPU yet
Jul 27 11:21:55 <ebassi>	We may have a glyph texture cache by copying it from Cogl, but that would still need to rasterize individual glyphs
Jul 27 11:23:37 <rudrab>	Hi, I have just moved to MenuButton from menubar.ui+builder (ebassi, thanks. It looks more gnomic and lot better)
Jul 27 11:24:58 <rudrab>	But I am not getting a way to add keyboard shortcuts. in menubar.ui, I had, say, http://paste.fedoraproject.org/396441/46963308/ to open file.
Jul 27 11:25:23 <rudrab>	how I can add the accel group in menubutton?
Jul 27 11:32:40 <visarion>	Is there a known issue with the Spinner not showing ?  I tried everything, even replacing it with another widget to see if that appears.
Jul 27 11:33:32 <ebassi>	rudrab: https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GAction - https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GMenu

Jul 27 11:47:46 <hramrach>	ebassi: how about widgets that span multiple screens? How do you render those?
Jul 27 11:48:26 <hramrach>	to which screen do you tie it? Or do you redo the binding several times each time you draw a frame?
Jul 27 11:49:59 <baedert>	Depends what the WM does afaik

Jul 27 12:24:16 <jjongsma>	ebassi, btw, we found the issue in spice-gtk, though I don't quite understand the mechanism for failure yet.
Jul 27 12:25:12 <jjongsma>	ebassi, https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-gtk/tree/src/spice-widget-egl.c#n315 <- this function was being called in the 'realize' handler for the widget. 
Jul 27 12:25:41 <jjongsma>	not calling that function resulted in a working widget ...
Jul 27 12:27:12 <hotcfoch>	How can g_async_initable_new_finish can know if there was an error?
Jul 27 12:30:41 <mclasen>	you pass it the async result which contains that information
Jul 27 12:33:55 <ebassi>	jjongsma: Ouch
Jul 27 12:34:30 <ebassi>	You're creating an EGL surface and getting a native window
Jul 27 12:35:31 <ebassi>	This is somewhat similar to what Clutter-GTK does, but Clutter-GTK disables double buffering
Jul 27 12:35:50 <ebassi>	Because that's the only way you're going to be able to draw
Jul 27 12:36:37 <jjongsma>	ebassi, yeah, when egl is enabled, we do disable double-buffering, but this initialization happens even without egl being enabled.
Jul 27 12:36:46 <jjongsma>	I'm not very familiar with this code though, elmarco probably knows better
Jul 27 12:37:13 <ebassi>	Ah, yes.. The rest of the coe in there assumes you can draw on the window surface as if you're the only owner
Jul 27 12:37:58 <ebassi>	jjongsma: It's the GDK_WINDOW_XID call that mucks up everythinge else
Jul 27 12:38:25 <jjongsma>	ebassi, yep, that's what I determined. I commented out everything but that and it still failed. But after commenting that out, it worked ;)
Jul 27 12:39:23 <ebassi>	You are forcing the GdkWindow to have a native surface, which has certain semantics; if you do that then you get to handle a lot of nasty stuff by yourself — including double buffering
Jul 27 12:39:39 <ebassi>	A bunch of stuff will also break, like popovers :-)
Jul 27 12:39:59 <hotcfoch>	mclasen: so the GError is supposed to be in GAsyncResult ?
Jul 27 12:40:01 <jjongsma>	elmarco, ^
Jul 27 12:40:35 <ebassi>	jjongsma: My suggestion would be to use GtkGLArea, if you want to render with GL, not create random EGL context ;-)
Jul 27 12:41:17 <ebassi>	Mostly because GdkGLContext and GtkGLArea will render on the appropriate surface, using the GDK rendering infrastructure, and nothing will break
Jul 27 12:42:26 <elmarco>	ebassi: we use gtkglarea, but we need an egl context, glx won't do
Jul 27 12:42:42 <elmarco>	ebassi: so gtkglarea is only used on wayland so far
Jul 27 12:43:31 <elmarco>	so that egl/x11 stuff is a hack, but we don't have much choice, unless gtk+ start using egl on x11, I wish it would
Jul 27 12:44:01 <hotcfoch>	mclasen: even before calling "g_async_initable_new_finish" ?
Jul 27 12:44:03 <elmarco>	other solution would be to implement the dmabuf import stuff with glx, that's probably harder
Jul 27 12:44:39 <ebassi>	If you use EGL on X11 you're ot going to get a bunch of GLX only extensions — like texture from pixmap; there's an EGL extension for that, but…  meh.
Jul 27 12:45:21 <mclasen>	hotcfoch: no, you have to call finish to get it
Jul 27 12:45:22 <ebassi>	We could let you specify you want an EGL context on X11; then you could create the GdkGLContext yourself
Jul 27 12:46:09 <ebassi>	gdk_x11_gl_context_set_use_egl(); it would need a bunch of silly checks in GdkX11GLContext::realize, but it would be doable
Jul 27 12:46:11 <mwleeds>	ebassi: json_path_match() seems to return already-existing value nodes but newly-allocated object/array nodes. So how can I modify an object node I have the path for?
Jul 27 12:46:36 <ebassi>	mwleeds: You… Don't?
Jul 27 12:47:04 <ebassi>	mwleeds: I'm sorry, it seems you're using json-glib in a way that I didn't think of when I wrote it
Jul 27 12:47:47 <hotcfoch>	mclasen: that's my question? how does it discover there is an error? what kind of information does GAsyncResult provides that can help to that function to find the error?
Jul 27 12:47:51 <ebassi>	The JsonPath API is for generatin "views" or results out of an existing JSON parsed tree
Jul 27 12:48:07 <ebassi>	Sorry, new keyboard. Let's try again.
Jul 27 12:48:12 <elmarco>	ebassi: you could mix egl and glx contexts, or the app using spice-gtk would have to call gdk_x11_gl_context_set_use_egl() ? 
Jul 27 12:48:16 <ebassi>	The JsonPath API is for generating "views" of results out of an existing JSON parsed tree
Jul 27 12:48:31 <ebassi>	elmarco: You cannot mix egl and glx contexts
Jul 27 12:48:36 <ebassi>	You cannot do that even now
Jul 27 12:48:54 <elmarco>	that's what I thought, actually I tried and resulted in weird crashes iirc
Jul 27 12:48:57 <ebassi>	All contexts are shared
Jul 27 12:49:20 <ebassi>	It's like trying to create legacy and core profile contexts at the same time
Jul 27 12:50:04 <mwleeds>	would you be open to a patch changing it to return the already existing nodes?
Jul 27 12:51:30 <ebassi>	mwleeds: No, I would not be open to that. The semantics are documented.
Jul 27 12:51:38 <elmarco>	jjongsma: did you identify the gtk+ commit that broke drawing?
Jul 27 12:52:17 <jjongsma>	elmarco, yeah, sent it to you in email already, but it's https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=2c7b21718f18ab743cd79784ae28cad582f58503
Jul 27 12:52:25 <elmarco>	jjongsma: thanks
Jul 27 12:53:23 <ebassi>	That's the proximal commit; the actual commit is: fc569f1ac6ff108afc17f7f439480273826af3a6
Jul 27 12:53:56 <ebassi>	Since that introduced the rule that double buffering can only occur on top-level native GdkWindow
Jul 27 12:54:03 <mwleeds>	documented where? the json_path_match docs don't say anything about this
Jul 27 12:54:35 <ebassi>	Commit 2c7b21718 just made GTK use those semantics
Jul 27 12:55:28 <feaneron>	mclasen: hey, please, pretend you've never seen that couple of patches I sent before
Jul 27 12:55:38 *	feaneron is absolutely ashamed of that
Jul 27 12:56:40 <ebassi>	mwleeds: It says it creates a new JsonNode of array type. You're right that it doesn't say that the element nodes are new, but I honestly don't want to make it return nodes from another tree
Jul 27 12:56:54 <ebassi>	mwleeds: The memory management model of JsonNode is already a massive fuck up
Jul 27 12:57:23 <ebassi>	It also maps to the behaviour of other JsonPath implementations, which return new nodes
Jul 27 12:58:53 <elmarco>	jjongsma: I guess our easier alternative is to not support switch 2d/3d anymore (or just link older gtk+ statically, /me half-kidding)
Jul 27 12:58:57 <mclasen>	hotcfoch: an async result is mainly a container for ... the result of an operation
Jul 27 12:59:13 <mclasen>	one possible result is an error
Jul 27 12:59:31 <mwleeds>	It already does return nodes from another tree when they are value nodes
Jul 27 13:00:35 <mwleeds>	so maybe the patch should be to make it return all new nodes
Jul 27 13:01:24 <ebassi>	mwleeds: I honestly don't understand what your goal is, then. I thought you wanted to get existing nodes
Jul 27 13:02:17 <mwleeds>	yeah that patch wouldn't help me at all. I just suggested it to make the behavior consistent with what you said about not wanting to return nodes from another tree.
Jul 27 13:03:35 <ebassi>	mwleeds: It copies them, which unsets the parent
Jul 27 13:03:46 <ebassi>	mwleeds: So it always returns new nodes
Jul 27 13:06:43 <mwleeds>	I'm not sure about the implementation but when I called json_node_set_value on a node it returned the original one was modified with the new value. Anyway I'll just figure out another way to do it; don't want to waste any more of your time.

Jul 27 13:22:22 <halfline>	gasuleg: you probably want to use the "notify::property-name" signal
Jul 27 13:22:23 <ebassi>	gasuleg: If you want to know if a property value has changed, there's the "notify" signal on GObject

Jul 27 13:30:17 <ebassi>	The signal signature is the one for GObject::notify — you can check in the GObject API reference for it
Jul 27 13:31:28 <gasuleg>	but... with this line g_signal_connect don't know what GObject i want to check
Jul 27 13:31:52 <gasuleg>	tried something like that but not working : g_signal_connect(view, "notify::smartinfo_action", G_CALLBACK(display_smartinfo_view),NULL);

Jul 28 08:45:43 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769076 gobject, normal, gtkdev, NEW , Fix warning: attempt to override closure->va_marshal with new marshal
Jul 28 08:45:53 <mclasen>	what are you referring to with "the code" ?
Jul 28 08:47:58 <mclasen>	oh, now I get it
Jul 28 09:23:39 <Company>	mclasen: My biggest issue with the code is that I'm not sure what the purpose of the marshaller is
Jul 28 09:24:04 <Company>	mclasen: ie if a marshaller may do extra work or if we expect it to be always the same generic piece of code
Jul 28 09:24:48 <mclasen>	its purpose is to marshal arguments
Jul 28 09:25:28 <Company>	yeah, but is something like the cairo_save/restore we do in GtkWidget::draw intended to be allowed?
Jul 28 09:27:25 <mclasen>	I think questions about intent and purpose are very often futile
Jul 28 09:27:35 <mclasen>	who could even answer that, and why does it matter ?
Jul 28 09:27:46 <Company>	because if it is allowed, then the fix you did would have fixed a real critical bug (because it'd bypass that save/restore)
Jul 28 09:28:19 <mclasen>	you mean the patch I attached to the bug ? or what fix ?
Jul 28 09:28:24 <Company>	and if that wasn't intended, then keeping the va marhsllers would be a good idea (because it improves performance in cases where people pass the default marshaller anyway)
Jul 28 09:28:29 <Company>	yeah, that patch
Jul 28 09:29:45 <mclasen>	one thing is clear: the va marshaller must be functionally equivalent to the marshaller
Jul 28 09:29:46 <Company>	also, it might be useful to write a testcase that checks marshallers get called
Jul 28 09:30:10 <mclasen>	if gobject somehow messes that up by using implicitly set va marshallers, then thats a bug
Jul 28 09:30:41 <Company>	one thing is not clear: Does the marshaller have to be functionally equivalent to the marshaller that glib-genmarshal would have generated?
Jul 28 09:57:06 <mclasen>	they commonly are, but I think that is not a strict requirement
Jul 28 09:57:42 <mclasen>	I would expect it to be documented if they aren't (as we do for ::draw)
Jul 28 10:07:34 <oholy>	mclasen, hey

Jul 28 10:08:45 <oholy>	mclasen, I am afraid that we don't want to add several GtkStacks to workaround this... isn't there another way?

Jul 28 10:14:18 <mclasen>	you can launch your search provider manually with G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all from a terminal
Jul 28 10:14:54 <mclasen>	or you can prefix the commandline the service file with systemd-cat to redirect its output to the journal

Jul 28 10:22:13 <ericwill>	mclasen / Company can we get a comment for https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=768902
Jul 28 10:22:13 <bugbot>	Bug 768902: .General, major, gtk-bugs, NEW , Font too small when using gtk_widget_override_font()
Jul 28 10:22:49 <rishi>	jwendell:  Hard to say without looking at the code and/or XML, I guess.
Jul 28 10:23:49 <baedert>	ericwill: I didn't understand why using css only works for default/initial font size
Jul 28 10:24:04 <mclasen>	ericwill: "There is a font size problem" is not really very concrete, as a problem description
Jul 28 10:24:05 <Company>	ericwill: I think we have patches that change things to multiply with dpi somewhere
Jul 28 10:24:18 <mclasen>	and the the testcase is using override_font
Jul 28 10:24:37 <Company>	ericwill: maybe we need to do that too in the override_font case (actually in the assign vfunc of the font css property)
Jul 28 10:25:06 <baedert>	mclasen: What else would it use?
Jul 28 10:25:09 *	Company no idea, hasn't looked at override_font() in ages
Jul 28 10:25:17 <ericwill>	mclasen Company let me clarify: the change in 3.21.x that calculates font sizes returns a significantly smaller size using the new DPI system
Jul 28 10:25:42 <mclasen>	here is what the docs say: 3.16: This function is not useful in the context of CSS-based
Jul 28 10:25:45 <mclasen>	 *   rendering. If you wish to change the font a widget uses to render its text
Jul 28 10:25:46 <mclasen>	 *   you should use a custom CSS style, through an application-specific
Jul 28 10:25:48 <mclasen>	 *   #GtkStyleProvider and a CSS style class.
Jul 28 10:26:17 <baedert>	I know, but given the bug title, of course it uses override_font
Jul 28 10:26:38 <ebassi>	I thought the issue in Eclipse was that setting the font-size in CSS didn't work
Jul 28 10:26:40 <Company>	ericwill: so we need to do the same math (or the reverse version) in the override_font() case it seems to me?
Jul 28 10:27:14 <ericwill>	Company most likely, using CSS uses the correct sizing but it introduces other issues that would require a lot of work for us
Jul 28 10:27:16 <mclasen>	baedert: but the description of the bug talks about 3.21 changes unrelated to override_font
Jul 28 10:27:25 <ericwill>	it would be easier to continue to use override_font
Jul 28 10:27:33 <mclasen>	as I said, not crisp enough of a bug to incite action
Jul 28 10:29:46 <jwendell>	rishi, I see, thanks. I'll ask for help when the code is on github then :)
Jul 28 10:31:42 <ericwill>	Company mclasen maybe the bug title was a bit vague
Jul 28 10:32:26 <mclasen>	looks like Company has an idea for how to keep override_font limping along a bit better
Jul 28 10:32:49 <ericwill>	okay
Jul 28 10:32:58 <ericwill>	our investigations lead us to gtkcssenumvalue
Jul 28 10:33:12 <Company>	ericwill: I think something like https://paste.fedoraproject.org/396880/14697163/ might work
Jul 28 10:33:13 <ericwill>	where the font size returned by font_size * get_dpi() / 72.0 are too small
Jul 28 10:33:39 <ericwill>	Company yeah that looks promising
Jul 28 10:33:52 <Company>	ericwill: didn't compile that and i might have done the order wrong - could you try it?
Jul 28 10:34:29 <ericwill>	will do
Jul 28 10:34:43 <Company>	the issue is probably that we report font sizes in PX inside css while the pango code uses PT
Jul 28 10:35:11 <Company>	so making sure we transform between them everywhere is an ongoing task
Jul 28 10:38:26 <Company>	ebassi, mclasen: Do we need to talk about the versioning results from the hackfest in some GTK guadec talk?
Jul 28 10:38:54 <mclasen>	we should, probably
Jul 28 10:39:08 <mclasen>	given that I'm talk-less this time (yay!), it'll have to be yours
Jul 28 10:39:41 <Company>	yeah, i guess i'll do that
Jul 28 10:40:11 <Company>	wish there was a schedule so I knew how much time was between my talk and the GTK bof
Jul 28 10:40:21 <Company>	so people have enough time to think about things

Jul 28 11:15:00 <pochu>	Company: ^
Jul 28 11:15:06 <ericwill>	Company the patch is great except for the order
Jul 28 11:15:12 <ericwill>	it should 96.0 / 72.0
Jul 28 11:15:17 <ericwill>	fixes our issue
Jul 28 11:15:20 <ericwill>	*should be

Jul 28 11:16:18 <Company>	pochu: thx for looking at the testsuite! Patches look great
Jul 28 11:17:26 <pochu>	Company: thanks :) both pushed
Jul 28 11:18:24 <Company>	ericwill: which one should be switched? assign or query?
Jul 28 11:18:36 <ericwill>	Company I switched both of them
Jul 28 11:20:31 <Company>	that seems like an awful lot of multiplications...
Jul 28 11:21:01 <Company>	actually, the query func is run everywhere all the time?!
Jul 28 11:23:23 <ericwill>	Company this is the working patch: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/396921/69719353/
Jul 28 11:23:26 <ericwill>	just swapped the numbers
Jul 28 11:24:28 <Company>	ericwill: line 18 of that patch should make all text everywhere 1.3x larger than before
Jul 28 11:24:32 <Company>	I think
Jul 28 11:24:41 <mclasen>	isn't it silly to stuff 100 into number_value_get only to scale the value afterwards ?
Jul 28 11:24:59 <Company>	mclasen: number_value_get() is a stupid function
Jul 28 11:25:19 <Company>	mclasen: because it takes the value for 100% as the 2nd argument - even for numbers that don't support percentages
Jul 28 11:25:33 <ericwill>	Company ah so maybe change it only for the assign function?
Jul 28 11:26:08 <ericwill>	let me try that
Jul 28 11:26:11 <Company>	ericwill: that seems wrong too, becauise then assigning multiplies but querying doesn't...
Jul 28 11:26:46 <Company>	ericwill: but it seems we already convert when querying the "font" property - just not when querying font-size
Jul 28 11:28:21 <Company>	ericwill: I think it might be useful to move the conversion
Jul 28 11:32:50 <Company>	ericwill: can you try https://paste.fedoraproject.org/396929/97199451/ ?
Jul 28 11:34:39 <ericwill>	Company sure
Jul 28 11:35:01 <Company>	without the first patch ofc
Jul 28 11:40:56 <ericwill>	Company yeah that patch works
Jul 28 11:40:58 <ericwill>	fixes the bug
Jul 28 11:41:15 <Company>	then let's go with that one
Jul 28 11:41:56 <ericwill>	Company okay, will you commit it?

Jul 28 14:57:12 <tonyctl>	hey I'm having an issue where I call gtk_widget_show_all() on my widget and it doesn't get mapped
Jul 28 14:57:22 <tonyctl>	can anyone give me some tips on how to debug it?
Jul 28 14:57:50 <baedert>	... is the parent of the widget mapped?
Jul 28 14:58:44 <tonyctl>	it's not showing up on the screen
Jul 28 14:59:26 <baedert>	check the mapped status and allocation of the widget and all parent widgets with the inspector
Jul 28 14:59:45 <tonyctl>	I checked mapped status and it says it's mapped
Jul 28 15:00:49 <tonyctl>	I never get a createnotify from the x server
Jul 28 15:04:04 <swilmet>	tonyctl: gtk_widget_set_no_show_all() ?
Jul 28 15:07:14 <tonyctl>	swilmet: that didn't seem to affect it
Jul 28 15:07:55 <tonyctl>	I'm working on a bug in a complicated application framework called cef so I think it might be a threading issue
Jul 28 15:07:59 <swilmet>	tonyctl: I meant, if it's called somewhere, you should either remove it or call gtk_widget_show()
Jul 28 15:09:08 <swilmet>	tonyctl: gtk functions should be called only from the main thread
Jul 28 15:10:19 <tonyctl>	yeah I looked into that and it seems like everything is running on the main thread
Jul 28 15:11:34 <tonyctl>	also maybe like 1/20 times it works properly
Jul 28 15:12:14 <tonyctl>	here is the bug I filed in cef: https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/issues/1946/linux-cefclient-example-hangs-when-opening
Jul 28 15:56:39 <iulianradu>	there's no way to remove a single item from a GtkListBox?
Jul 28 15:56:56 <iulianradu>	Without binding a model to it
Jul 28 15:57:04 <baedert>	there's always gtk_container_remove
Jul 28 15:57:20 <iulianradu>	Oh, right
Jul 28 16:19:56 <tonyctl>	so cef has some calls that interact with the xwindow of the gtk widget
Jul 28 16:20:17 <tonyctl>	if I set xlib to make all its calls to be synchronous, I don't get that bug
Jul 28 16:21:02 <tonyctl>	I wonder if there was some bad interactions between gtk and xlib

Jul 28 16:47:02 <tonyctl>	I think maybe they are missing a flush somewhere
Jul 28 16:47:05 <halfline>	honestly probably a better bet to move your X calls to the main thread
Jul 28 16:47:18 <halfline>	if possible
Jul 28 16:47:54 <tonyctl>	I haven't checked if all the X calls happen on the main thread, but that would probably be my next move
Jul 28 16:48:57 <halfline>	oh guess i misunderstood you
Jul 28 16:53:12 <bugbot>	New gtk+ bug 769287 filed by lists.ban@herbesfolles.org.
Jul 28 16:53:12 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769287 Widget: Other, normal, gtk-bugs, NEW , GtkMenuToolButton:show-menu is emitted twice and breaks dynamic menus
Jul 28 17:50:04 <rudrab>	anyone please?
Jul 28 21:02:32 <hugomg>	Hello there! I'm working on getting rid of deprecation warnings from an existing gtk program and right now the most common complaint  GTK has is the "use-stock" property in GtkButton
Jul 28 21:03:53 <hugomg>	However, I can't figure out how I'm supposed to change my code to get rid of this warning. The current system with "stock items" puts both a nice icon and a translated label in the button. Am I supposed to try to replicate this by hand using images (with appropriate "icon-name") and a separate label?
Jul 28 21:04:45 <hugomg>	Or should I get rid of one of  the two (the label or the icon)? I heard somewhere that GTK is discouraging developers from putting icons in buttons now.
Jul 28 21:28:08 <mclasen>	hugomg: if you want to keep both icon and label  in buttons without using deprecated api, use gtk_button_set_label and gtk_button_set_image
Jul 28 21:28:44 <hugomg>	the part that confuses me the most is whether I even should
Jul 28 21:29:02 <hugomg>	because in the new api they separated the icon and label, which used to be defined together
Jul 28 21:29:58 <mclasen>	buttons with icons and labels have certainly become unfashionable 
Jul 28 21:30:12 <hugomg>	I mean, whoever originally coded those button only made it have both image and label because thats what "use-stock" did.
Jul 28 21:30:25 <mclasen>	right
Jul 28 21:31:41 <mclasen>	in that case, just using gtk_button_new_with_label will give you a button with a label
Jul 28 21:32:01 <mclasen>	and gtk_button_from_from_icon_name will give you a button with an icon
Jul 28 21:32:42 <hugomg>	if I use a label I need to call some function to translate it don't I?
Jul 28 21:32:50 <hugomg>	The "use-stock" used to do that as well
Jul 28 21:32:56 <mclasen>	yes
Jul 28 21:34:16 <mclasen>	if your application is set up for translations with gettext, then just using _("My label") is enough
Jul 28 21:34:56 <hugomg>	the application is in Lua so I'll need to figure out what is its equivalent to the "_" bit
Jul 28 21:35:15 <hugomg>	but in any case, are there "default" labels for things like "Open" , "Close" and so on?
Jul 28 21:35:26 <hugomg>	and where would I find a list, if so?
Jul 28 21:36:44 <GvP>	hello I had a question regarding the theme for rhythmbox, I believe that it's hard to differentiate whether the shuffle and repeat buttons are selected using the visible indicator
Jul 28 21:37:25 <GvP>	and was thinking that there may be a way to display them better such as inverting or highlighting more
Jul 28 21:37:25 <mclasen>	well, thats what the stock system is
Jul 29 05:43:47 <nacho>	ebassi, hey
Jul 29 05:44:05 <nacho>	ebassi, any chance to release json-glib? :)

Jul 29 08:54:28 <visarion>	Weird problem for me. Whatever I do, even if I view the gtk3-demo, I can't see a Spinner using jhbuild 
Jul 29 09:17:51 <The_gull>	visarion: `jhbuild run gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations true` ?
Jul 29 09:20:05 <visarion>	The_gull: I ran that command, but still I can't view the Spinner in gt3-demo

Jul 29 09:21:22 <ebassi>	visarion: Are you running GNOME inside a VM?
Jul 29 09:21:32 <visarion>	ebassi: No
Jul 29 09:22:03 <ebassi>	visarion: Which desktop environment are you using to build gtk3-demo under jhbuild?
Jul 29 09:22:15 <visarion>	fedora 24
Jul 29 09:22:24 <ebassi>	Running GNOME?
Jul 29 09:22:28 <visarion>	yeah
Jul 29 09:22:36 <ebassi>	Mmh
Jul 29 09:22:52 <The_gull>	visarion: a custom theme ?
Jul 29 09:23:07 <visarion>	the spinner stopped showing while still on fedora23, I don't know why
Jul 29 09:23:18 <visarion>	never saw the spinner after that, under jhbuild
Jul 29 09:23:28 <visarion>	no custom theme
Jul 29 09:24:27 <visarion>	it's not a big problem for me, as I can test what I code regarding the Spinner outside of jhbuild
Jul 29 09:24:52 <baedert>	do you have adwaita-icon-theme built?
Jul 29 09:24:53 <ebassi>	visarion: What does `glxinfo | grep "renderer string"` say?
Jul 29 09:25:37 <visarion>	OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) HD Graphics 5500 (Broadwell GT2) 
Jul 29 09:26:12 <ebassi>	Okay, so the system is not disabling animations because it cannot keep up
Jul 29 09:26:30 <ebassi>	I'm out of ideas
Jul 29 09:26:45 <ebassi>	And I cannot reproduce, here on Fedora 24 and Intel

Jul 29 09:28:49 <visarion>	baedert: I don't think I played with any of that
Jul 29 09:29:05 <visarion>	so they are default I guess
Jul 29 09:30:39 <baedert>	the default was gnome-icon-theme once and then switched to adwaita-icon-theme

Jul 29 12:45:10 <mgorse>	mclasen: I'm not sure if you're the person to ask, but do you know if anyone has looked at bgo#768738? I can't tell because the bug isn't public
Jul 29 12:45:56 <mclasen>	I asked Company to look at it, if thats the one I'm thinking of
Jul 29 12:46:34 <Company>	it isn't
Jul 29 12:46:43 <Company>	because i'm not authorized on that one :)
Jul 29 12:46:56 <mgorse>	Okay. Patch looks okay to me, fwiw. It's against gdk-pixbuf
Jul 29 12:47:05 <mclasen>	try now
Jul 29 12:47:36 <mclasen>	we had some existential questions around security of gdk-pixbuf
Jul 29 12:47:51 <mclasen>	and I think thats where we left things the last time we talked about it

Jul 29 13:54:38 <throwaway849>	does anyone know how to have a gtk program run when linux starts?
Jul 29 14:02:40 <lufimtse>	hullo folks. I have an async function that has a callback. I need to turn that into a syncronous call like "result = my_async_function()". Is there a good way of doing it? (I've looked at GTask, seems kinda complicated? anyone has a snippet?)
Jul 29 14:03:01 <baedert>	GTask is how you make something async, not sync
Jul 29 14:03:07 <lufimtse>	I see
Jul 29 14:03:13 <lufimtse>	any good method to go the other way?
Jul 29 14:03:30 <baedert>	you *could* create a new mainloop, but... why do you want to do that?
Jul 29 14:03:53 <lufimtse>	I"m a library developer, our call is syncronous, but underlying call is async
Jul 29 14:04:25 <lufimtse>	spin lock?
Jul 29 14:04:28 <baedert>	that's kind of useless, that sync call might block even undefined amount of time...
Jul 29 14:04:39 <baedert>	yes, essentially
Jul 29 14:04:46 <lufimtse>	it runs in it's own thread, so I guess... 
Jul 29 14:04:56 <lufimtse>	in it's own async thread
Jul 29 14:05:08 <lufimtse>	like an async thread calling another async thread...
Jul 29 14:05:34 <lufimtse>	baedert, do you know of any good spin lock mechanism, does glib have something build in or just regular pthreads?
Jul 29 14:08:57 <baedert>	I have only seen that being done in https://git.gnome.org/browse/librest/tree/rest/rest-proxy-call.c?h=librest-0-7#n1403
Jul 29 14:25:29 <lufimtse>	baedert, I guess go with GMutex instead?
Jul 29 14:25:43 <lufimtse>	considering it'll be run in the context of a single thread
Jul 29 14:26:25 <tonyctl>	hey how do I get a gtk window from a gtk widget?
Jul 29 14:27:15 <baedert>	gtk_widget_get_toplevel

Jul 29 14:28:11 <baedert>	first check if it even is a GtkWindow

Jul 30 07:07:27 <rudrab>	basically I am trying to place a combobox inside a cell
Jul 30 07:12:26 <The_gull>	rudrab: inside a GtkTreeView, you mean ?
Jul 30 07:12:42 <rudrab>	The_gull:yes
Jul 30 07:13:47 <The_gull>	rudrab: there’s GtkCellRendererCombo
Jul 30 07:14:42 <rudrab>	The_gull: Thats what I am trying to do. But I am trying to only get the signal on click, but GtkCellRendererCombo is also replacing the string
Jul 30 07:15:08 <iulianradu>	I'd like to have a GSequence or a GList as a property. Do I need to make register that as a boxed type first?
Jul 30 07:15:30 <rudrab>	The_gull: I am following http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cellrenderers.html#cellrenderercombo
Jul 30 07:16:25 <rudrab>	while I just want to get the on_combo_changed activated, I dont want to replace the string
Jul 30 07:18:33 <The_gull>	rudrab: what are you trying to archive ? a combobox is something that let the user select something between multiple choice, is that really your need ?
Jul 30 07:20:40 <rudrab>	The_gull: yes. I just need to select something, rest will be done on the function
Jul 30 07:21:05 <rudrab>	But, as in the example, the choice is replaced in the string
Jul 30 07:21:11 <rudrab>	which I dont want
Jul 30 07:26:42 <The_gull>	rudrab: how do you want the user to know about the currently selected option ?
Jul 30 07:28:06 <rudrab>	The_gull: user will just click on the combobox option, and no option is selected by default
Jul 30 07:31:52 <The_gull>	rudrab: I’d suggest using a GtkCellRendererCombo with, as a first choice, a « -- Select your option -- » entry ; else, you’re on your own, because what you want is not a standard GtkCellRenederer, and such a design not even exists as a standard GtkWidget…

Jul 30 13:16:50 <Kostic>	Hi everyone. Where can I find the css with which I can turn GtkButtons to blue and red (as in gnome-screenshot and in gnome-sound-recorder)?
Jul 30 13:17:35 <Kostic>	Actually, this one is more for #gnome.
Jul 30 13:18:56 <borschty>	for red, add the "destructive-action" style class to a button
Jul 30 13:19:18 <Kostic>	Really? That's... Simple. :)
Jul 30 13:20:01 <borschty>	and blue is "suggested-action"
Jul 30 13:20:24 <borschty>	(of course the colors you will get depend on the theme)

Jul 30 13:35:10 <ernestask>	shouldn’t it be context.add_class()?
Jul 30 13:36:31 <Kostic>	Yes. You are right. :)

Jul 30 22:52:39 <Rhetorical>	I'm having problems with a dark gtk 3.0 theme and nm-applet. The theme has applied to everything except the background of text boxes (e.g., the whole right-click menu for the icon, the dropdown lists, the connection information box, etc.), so I've ended up with light text on the default light background. I've done some googling, but not had any luck. Where
Jul 30 22:52:39 <Rhetorical>	would be a good place to start looking for a solution?
Jul 30 23:36:07 <Company>	Rhetorical: the easiest solution may be restarting nm-applet and hoping it's a bug resulting from switching the theme that goes away with the restart
Jul 31 05:53:52 <The_gull>	Rhetorical: open a bug against the theme..?

Jul 31 22:05:10 <raymod2>	Is it feasible to compile a GTK application to run on both 32-bit and 64-bit Linux?
Jul 31 22:06:56 <raymod2>	When I compile the GTK application in a 64-bit Fedora VM it won't run on a 32-bit Fedora VM (which makes sense).  But also when I compile the GTK application in a 32-bit Fedora VM it won't ron on a 64-bit VM.  It complains about missing shared libraries (ie. libgtk-3.so.0).
Jul 31 22:09:17 <TingPing>	raymod2, just make two packages..
Jul 31 22:11:19 <raymod2>	I guess that is an option.  I don't think my application benefits from 64-bit, though, so I would rather distribute just one package.  That's my strategy on Windows.
Jul 31 22:12:17 <TingPing>	some distros support multilib, but that is generally only for proprietary things that can't be rebuilt
Jul 31 22:12:54 <raymod2>	OSX doesn't have this problem because they are 64-bit only.
Jul 31 23:34:17 <benwaffle>	OSX has multilib
Jul 31 23:34:35 <benwaffle>	multiple architectures in a single file
Aug 01 00:25:00 <raymod2>	benwaffle - yeah that's for older OSX versions - it's been 64-bit only for awhile

Aug 01 00:27:44 <raymod2>	ooops (July 2011)
Aug 01 00:52:43 <grawity>	distributing "only 32-bit" is going to be a pain in the ass for many people, too

Aug 01 05:48:46 <iulianradu>	baedert: Hi! I'd like to retrieve some data from some widgets inside a dialog when the dialog is being destroyed. Where should I do that?
Aug 01 05:51:17 <baedert>	umm delete-event? dunno
Aug 01 05:55:54 <iulianradu>	baedert: Actually, I was hoping to override/connect to a signal of a child widget of that dialog (which is not a toplevel window) and save that from that widget when that widget is destroyed.
Aug 01 05:57:20 <iulianradu>	save data from it's children*
Aug 01 05:57:42 <iulianradu>	I tried overriding destroy () for that widget but sometimes it's children are destroyed before I can call get_text () and such
Aug 01 05:58:21 <baedert>	get_text on the toplevel?
Aug 01 06:02:49 <ebassi>	iulianradu: You cannot really know the state of the widgets during destruction
Aug 01 06:03:10 <iulianradu>	baedert: On a entry inside the widget whose signal I override.
Aug 01 06:03:50 <iulianradu>	ebassi: Is there a moment when I know their state before destruction?
Aug 01 06:03:58 <ebassi>	iulianradu: What kind of data are you trying to get, and for what purpose?
Aug 01 06:04:41 <ebassi>	iulianradu: In general, you don't gather data when you get to the destruction phase; you update your model whenever the widgets state change
Aug 01 06:05:15 <ebassi>	https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/unstable/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-destroy — as per doc :-)
Aug 01 06:05:47 <iulianradu>	ebassi: Title/uri of a bookmark. I was hoping not to save everything to a file each time I change the text inside an entry
Aug 01 06:06:30 <baedert>	you can save on confirm and/or delete-event of the toplevel I guess?
Aug 01 06:07:06 <ebassi>	iulianradu: You can install a timeout and coalesce multiple changes
Aug 01 06:07:52 <ebassi>	iulianradu: But, in general, you should save to a file when the dialog is closed
Aug 01 06:08:09 <ebassi>	(assuming it's a GtkDialog, then it's a simple case of connecting to the "response" signal)
Aug 01 06:08:34 <ebassi>	iulianradu: You can save to file on destroy; what you cannot do is query the widgets during destruction
Aug 01 06:09:47 <ebassi>	iulianradu: Basically, you update a bunch of stored strings every time the GtkEntry changes; then, on the dialog's destruction you save those strings to a file — or, better yet, you queue an idle that saves to a file
Aug 01 06:09:51 <iulianradu>	baedert, ebassi: I'm also using my widget (a Grid) in a popover. I was hoping to save everything when the grid is destroyed, not it's toplevel
Aug 01 06:09:54 <ebassi>	to avoid blocking the widget destruction
Aug 01 06:10:29 <ebassi>	Or queue a GTask
Aug 01 06:10:35 <ebassi>	(even better)
Aug 01 06:12:13 <iulianradu>	ebassi: That would work
Aug 01 06:12:24 <ebassi>	If you want to get fancy, you could create a small object that holds the title and uri of a bookmark as two properties, and use a property binding to keep those two properties in sync with the GtkEntry:text one
Aug 01 06:12:53 <ebassi>	Then, when the grid gets destroyed, you pass the object to a GTask that saves the contents of the object into a file
Aug 01 06:13:53 <iulianradu>	ebassi: Oh! That's great! I already have the object
Aug 01 06:14:32 <iulianradu>	baedert, ebassi: Thanks for help!

Aug 01 06:34:57 <jaeckel>	I'm using GIOChannel from glib 2.44.1 to read data from a serial port, we just found out that if the serial device outputs a string that ends in ",B\r" the GIO channel seems to eat up the 
Aug 01 06:35:44 <baedert>	the suspense is killing me
Aug 01 06:35:53 <jaeckel>	",B" and it was never seen again... and it happens always... I roughly searched for it, but couldn't find any hint, is that familiar to someone else?
Aug 01 06:36:06 <jaeckel>	sorry for the accidental error in between :D
Aug 01 06:36:12 <jaeckel>	s/error/enter
Aug 01 06:37:13 <jaeckel>	and sorry for the bad grammar...
Aug 01 06:46:34 <mceier>	I assume that you're checking serial device output, by printing it on the console: \r is control code that means to return to the begining of line - if you're outputting ",B\r" to console, anything that follows will overwrite ",B". 
Aug 01 07:00:09 <jaeckel>	well, but that doesn't explain why it does that only for ",B" if I have ",[ACD]" it works fine...
Aug 01 07:15:45 <jaeckel>	what is also weird is that if I use g_io_channel_set_line_term(data_channel, "\r", -1); I receive nothing, if I add "\n" there I receive something... I also do g_io_channel_set_encoding(data_channel, NULL, NULL); ...
Aug 01 07:16:39 <jaeckel>	and just to make it clear, yes the serial device sends \r(0x0d) as line terminator
Aug 01 07:54:21 <jaeckel>	okay, the serial port has the ICRNL option set which explains the \r to \n translation
Aug 01 07:59:54 <jaeckel>	and ICANON

Aug 01 08:02:34 <rudrab>	Hi, how I can add a row index to a treeview? I am currently doing that a bit artificially as https://paste.gnome.org/pamp65exv

Aug 01 08:07:23 <jaeckel>	thx for your help btw
Aug 01 08:07:24 <jaeckel>	bye
Aug 01 08:18:06 <garnacho>	rudrab: sounds like an usecase for Gtk.TreeViewColumn's set_cell_data_func()
Aug 01 08:30:54 <LRN>	what's the vala equivalent of #ifdef G_OS_WIN32 ?
Aug 01 08:32:51 <rudrab>	garnacho: thanks, but the problem is to get the row index itself. When I am editing, I can get the row number from get_selected_rows().get_indices(), but when inserting a new line(like opening from a file), how I will get the row number?
Aug 01 08:41:33 <garnacho>	rudrab: the cell data func is run to set up the cell renderer before doing anything involved with any given row. In the callback you are given the current iter that's being set up, if you pull the index from there and set it as the cell renderer text, you get a self-numbering column/renderer
Aug 01 08:41:41 <garnacho>	rudrab: see https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkTreeViewColumn.html#GtkTreeCellDataFunc

Aug 01 11:08:27 <owen>	I add an action to a GtkApplicationWindow, I put a button in that window, I set the action-name of the button to <action_name> or win.<action-name>, it stays disabled - is there anything else i need to do?

Aug 01 11:10:53 <mclasen>	ah
Aug 01 11:11:01 <owen>	convention seems to be actions are _ but I expected them to use - like signals/props so got confused and used a _ in one place and a - in another

Aug 01 11:13:35 <owen>	Perhaps, not sure that it common
Aug 01 11:13:59 <owen>	Probably would have been good to *forbid* underscores in action names, but too late for that

Aug 01 13:08:51 <hotcfoch>	hi
Aug 01 13:09:02 <hotcfoch>	is it possible to get the list of callback functions for a g_obect?
Aug 01 13:14:51 <swilmet>	hotcfoch: for a certain signal, call g_signal_lookup() and g_signal_handler_find()
Aug 01 13:18:21 <ebassi>	hotcfoch: I cannot think of any non-evil things you may want to do with that information
Aug 01 13:18:29 <ebassi>	hotcfoch: What is it that you're trying to achieve?
Aug 01 13:19:57 <swilmet>	there is a useful use-case: block all signal handlers temporarily
Aug 01 13:21:10 <swilmet>	when we set a certain value to a property temporarily (we re-set back the old value afterwards)
Aug 01 13:21:17 <hotcfoch>	ebassi: I have a attribute foo (gobject), and a method resetFoo that replaces foo by other (gobject) but keeping the connected signal handlers
Aug 01 13:24:02 <halfline>	hotcfoch: icky
Aug 01 13:24:27 <halfline>	hotcfoch: what about g_object_set_data ? what if the code that set up the handlers keeps a reference to the object outside the callback?
Aug 01 13:25:20 <halfline>	it'd be better to provide a way for the first object to subsume the data from the second object, but stick around i think.
Aug 01 13:31:43 <hotcfoch>	halfline: what info does data contain?
Aug 01 13:32:00 <halfline>	anything the user wants to put in it
Aug 01 13:34:48 <swilmet>	hotcfoch: create a property for the foo attribute, and on the notify signal the callbacks need to be connected on the new object (but this is done by the users of the class, not the class itself)
Aug 01 13:36:23 <swilmet>	hotcfoch: but it means that the users of the class need to keep around a pointer to the old object, so instead of notify, you could provide a signal foo-changed(old_foo, new_foo)
Aug 01 13:46:35 <tonyctl>	do I need to do anything special to make gtkglext work on gtk2?
Aug 01 14:02:15 <LRN>	gtk2 is soo-o-o last century
Aug 01 14:02:16 <ebassi>	tonyctl: You'll need lots of hope, most likely
Aug 01 14:02:33 <ebassi>	tonyctl: GtkGLExt hasn't been touched in many moons
Aug 01 14:02:44 <ebassi>	It *should* work
Aug 01 14:02:54 <tonyctl>	it only works in unity
Aug 01 14:03:22 <tonyctl>	I think it has something to do with compiz being an opengl compositor
Aug 01 14:03:45 <ebassi>	To be fair, anything newly written that still uses gtk2 and legacy GL in 2016 is probably not going to go far in terms of reliability and/or testing
Aug 01 14:04:01 <tonyctl>	oh it's not at all
Aug 01 14:04:06 <ebassi>	tonyctl: GL should work (on X11) regardless of the presence of a compositor
Aug 01 14:04:30 <tonyctl>	I'm getting x11 errors and my window isn't opening
Aug 01 14:04:42 <ebassi>	tonyctl: Which X11 errors are you getting?
Aug 01 14:05:14 <tonyctl>	I think they are badwindow
Aug 01 14:06:16 <ebassi>	Care to pastebin them?
Aug 01 14:07:19 <tonyctl>	X error received: type 0, serial 607, error_code 3 (BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)), request_code 1, minor_code 0
Aug 01 14:07:45 <tonyctl>	https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/issues/1946/linux-cefclient-example-hangs-when-opening
Aug 01 14:09:29 <ebassi>	Oh, ugh
Aug 01 14:09:44 <ebassi>	That's on CEF?
Aug 01 14:09:51 *	ebassi is not going to touch that
Aug 01 14:09:52 <tonyctl>	yeah
Aug 01 14:10:15 <tonyctl>	why not?
Aug 01 14:10:57 <ebassi>	Because it's a hell-hole of stuff that likely is using GTK in 20 different wrong ways
Aug 01 14:11:24 <tonyctl>	I think you are right because it doesn't work
Aug 01 14:11:26 <ebassi>	So, sorry; you'll have to debug it yourself :-/
Aug 01 14:12:22 <tonyctl>	can you give me any pointers on fixing that issue at all?
Aug 01 14:12:24 <ebassi>	It's likely something is creating a window with the wrong visual and GLX does not work; or something is passing the wrong window around
Aug 01 14:12:39 <ebassi>	"invalid Window parameter" seems to point to the latter
Aug 01 14:13:16 <ebassi>	You'll have to go around inside the code that creates the widgets and realizes them, and see which windows it creates
Aug 01 14:13:21 <tonyctl>	so the thing is that the call to `gtk_widget_show()` does nothing
Aug 01 14:13:25 <ebassi>	Other than that, I don't know
Aug 01 14:13:48 <ebassi>	tonyctl: gtk_widget_show() "just" causes a realization of the GtkWidget, and marks it as visible
Aug 01 14:14:16 <ebassi>	Look at the realize() implementation, and look at which GdkWindow it creates or uses with GtkGLExt
Aug 01 14:15:00 <ebassi>	Since GtkGLExt expects to have access to a real, native X11 window, you'll have to ensure that the window it uses is the right one
Aug 01 14:15:36 <tonyctl>	it gives me a x11 window back, but I never get a CreateNotify or MapNotify on the root window
Aug 01 14:15:54 <tonyctl>	so it's creating an id, but not the window
Aug 01 14:16:02 <tonyctl>	that id never gets into the tree
Aug 01 14:17:13 <ebassi>	Wait, are you trying to draw on the root X11 window?
Aug 01 14:17:21 <ebassi>	That's… That's not a good idea.
Aug 01 14:17:50 <tonyctl>	no, but you should get the CreateNotify when the window is created
Aug 01 14:18:20 <ebassi>	Why? The root X11 window is created by the X server
Aug 01 14:19:06 <tonyctl>	yeah and it gets notified when windows are created
Aug 01 14:19:26 <tonyctl>	try `xev -root` and then open a window and you will see a CreateNotify
Aug 01 14:19:39 <ebassi>	You need a specific event mask for that
Aug 01 14:19:55 <ebassi>	And I don't understand why you'd be creating children of the root window
Aug 01 14:20:04 <ebassi>	That only happens for top-levels
Aug 01 14:20:26 <tonyctl>	I'm just using that as evidence that the window never gets created or mapped
Aug 01 14:20:28 <ebassi>	And even then, I don't understand why you should track the creation of children of the root window, unless you're a compositor or a toolkit
Aug 01 14:21:24 <tonyctl>	it means that XCreateWindow never happens
Aug 01 14:21:51 <ebassi>	tonyctl: You could check that by looking at what calls XCreateWindow
Aug 01 14:22:02 <ebassi>	I think you're overcomplicating this by a large factor
Aug 01 14:22:31 <tonyctl>	well I'm trying to fix that bug and nothing simple has worked so far
Aug 01 14:22:45 <tonyctl>	isn't gtk supposed to call XCreateWindow behind the scenes?
Aug 01 14:23:00 <ebassi>	It depends, if the window is supposed to be backed by a native surface
Aug 01 14:23:05 <ebassi>	Which isn't the case by default
Aug 01 14:23:44 <tonyctl>	but it needs a window to show up on the screen right?
Aug 01 14:26:11 <ebassi>	Well, the top-level does
Aug 01 14:26:15 <ebassi>	Child widgets don't
Aug 01 14:26:30 <ebassi>	Some do — and GtkGLExt most definitely does
Aug 01 14:26:41 <tonyctl>	the top level is never gettings its window created
Aug 01 14:26:43 <ebassi>	But it's opt in
Aug 01 14:27:03 <tonyctl>	oh ok well maybe they're not opting in
Aug 01 14:27:09 <ebassi>	That I have more issues believing
Aug 01 14:27:15 <ebassi>	You don't see the whole window?
Aug 01 14:27:30 <tonyctl>	the first one is fine
Aug 01 14:27:50 <tonyctl>	the subsequent windows never show up
Aug 01 14:27:54 *	ebassi mutters something about being roped into debugging what he said he wouldn't debug
Aug 01 14:28:10 <tonyctl>	lol I appreciate the help though
Aug 01 14:28:23 <ebassi>	tonyctl: Then you probably want to check inside the code that creates the top levels in CEF and see what happens there
Aug 01 14:28:59 <tonyctl>	yeah I did and it looks fine
Aug 01 14:29:06 <tonyctl>	it even works on unity, but not on any other window manager
Aug 01 14:56:36 <baedert>	Let's say I'm doing a gdk_window_scrol(gtk_widget_get_window(widget), x, y) -- in gtk2 there was apparently a call to gdk_window_process_updates needed to "immediately display the result". Is that still true in gtk3?

Aug 02 00:25:30 <raymod2>	I don't see how it would matter unless the calling convention for the APIs was different.  I guess pointer arguments that are pushed onto the stack occupy 64-bits instead of 32-bits?

Aug 02 09:52:19 <baedert>	gasuleg: What do you want to display exactly? just multiline text?
Aug 02 09:55:24 <gasuleg>	I want to display some technical information in a video like the nerd stats on youtube ( you can found them in the right click menu) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkkDvKGcNSo
Aug 02 09:56:27 <baedert>	looks lik a GtkGrid and a few labels?
Aug 02 09:56:37 <gasuleg>	so basicly I want to display some text + variables 
Aug 02 09:58:06 <gasuleg>	yeah, that what I did but that not really easy to add some new element in my architecture ( add new gtklabel, add to the clutter, add to the ui file and finally set text and that for all the label
Aug 02 09:58:28 <gasuleg>	i'm think we can do that in only one widget, no?
Aug 02 09:59:17 <baedert>	You can always just draw things using cairo if you want. But you don't want to do that.
Aug 02 09:59:41 <rrika>	what is the preferrable way of spawning a process from a program with glib main loop? running g_spawn_sync on a new thread, or running g_spawn_async_with_pipes(), and putting an IO channel on its stdout?
Aug 02 10:00:08 <gasuleg>	baedert, why I don't want to? difficult?
Aug 02 10:00:48 <gasuleg>	so, the GtkTextView is not the best widget to do what I want to do?
Aug 02 10:00:59 <baedert>	gasuleg: well now you have to do layout and measuring yourself, possibly ellipsize the labels, etc.
Aug 02 10:01:15 <rudrab>	Hi, Can I have a little bit of help? I am trying to populate a treeview from a list(either parsed from file, or other source). like, https://paste.gnome.org/pz2j2bueb
Aug 02 10:03:05 <gasuleg>	baedert, I'm ok with the label. I actually display all my information with it. I just wanted to know if some widget are better for what I want to do
Aug 02 10:03:24 <rudrab>	I am not sure how to index the row properly. This method is ok if I just read from a single source. If I am trying to append the treeview, the index is 0 again.
Aug 02 10:03:33 <xjuan>	gasuleg: GtkLabel + g_strdup_printf() should do the trick
Aug 02 10:04:09 <gasuleg>	xjuan, that what I do but can you do some carriage return?
Aug 02 10:04:34 <baedert>	what do you mean by carriage return?
Aug 02 10:04:35 <xjuan>	sure why not
Aug 02 10:04:40 <xjuan>	\n
Aug 02 10:04:49 <baedert>	so still a wrapping label?
Aug 02 10:05:14 <ernestask>	\r
Aug 02 10:05:17 <ernestask>	not \n
Aug 02 10:06:00 <gasuleg>	that what I doing actually: http://pastebin.com/UgpSUjbE
Aug 02 10:06:29 <gasuleg>	to much label for what I'm doing, isn't it?
Aug 02 10:07:31 <xjuan>	hmm
Aug 02 10:07:43 <xjuan>	you are leaking memory
Aug 02 10:08:16 <xjuan>	you have to free the string returned by g_strdup_printf() once you are done with it
Aug 02 10:08:19 <xjuan>	str = g_strdup_printf ("Value one: %d\nAnother value: %d\netc", v1, v2);
Aug 02 10:08:20 <xjuan>	gtk_label_set_text (label, str);
Aug 02 10:08:22 <xjuan>	g_free (srt);
Aug 02 10:09:15 <gasuleg>	hooo, that how we use g_free, thx for that
Aug 02 10:09:43 <gasuleg>	well, I will try \n and \r
Aug 02 10:09:51 <xjuan>	you could split the format string in multiple lines to make it look better
Aug 02 10:10:08 <xjuan>	gasuleg: you do not need \r
Aug 02 10:10:22 <xjuan>	new line is enough
Aug 02 10:11:03 <gasuleg>	but.... it's not better to use only one label?
Aug 02 10:11:42 <xjuan>	no i mean something like
Aug 02 10:12:19 <xjuan>	str = g_strdup_printf ("Value one: %d\n"
Aug 02 10:12:21 <xjuan>	                       "Another value: %d\n"
Aug 02 10:12:22 <xjuan>	                       "etc", v1, v2);
Aug 02 10:13:01 <gasuleg>	yeah yeah, ok, I see
Aug 02 10:13:18 <gasuleg>	I will try that, thx for you help guys!!!
Aug 02 10:13:18 <xjuan>	btw make sure you do not have to free the string returned by SmartInfoHub::instance().callID().toStdString().c_str()
Aug 02 10:13:36 <xjuan>	you might be leaking memory there too
Aug 02 10:16:29 <gasuleg>	xjuan, you said that cause it's a string? (sorry, I'm just... noob XD)
Aug 02 10:19:54 <xjuan>	just saying you need to check the docs
Aug 02 10:20:09 <gasuleg>	ok, thx xjuan 
Aug 02 10:20:10 <xjuan>	and see what SmartInfoHub::instance().callID().toStdString().c_str() returns
Aug 02 10:20:36 <gasuleg>	well... I program it... XD he return string
Aug 02 10:20:54 <gasuleg>	and I free nothing
Aug 02 10:23:38 <xjuan>	yeah if toStdString() returns what it says it does (a std:string) then c_str() should be a pointer to the internal buffer
Aug 02 10:23:47 <xjuan>	so you do not have to free it
Aug 02 10:25:48 <rudrab>	any help please?
Aug 02 10:26:09 <gasuleg>	so with g_free (srt); what I free exactly?
Aug 02 10:33:27 <xjuan>	gasuleg: the memory allocated by g_strdup_printf() in the str pointer
Aug 02 10:34:13 <xjuan>	gasuleg: you really need to read about memory
Aug 02 10:34:48 <xjuan>	specially if you want to program in C/C++

Aug 02 13:45:47 <ebassi>	mclasen: If you want to have a look at wip/ebassi/gsk-renderer, I just landed the port of GtkBox from ::draw to ::get_render_node(), alongside with a first stab at gtk_css_gadget_get_render_node()
Aug 02 13:46:06 <mclasen>	I will, certainly!
Aug 02 13:46:19 <ebassi>	I have a small rendering artefact on the headerbar — likely some offset
Aug 02 13:46:22 <mclasen>	anything is better than poking at pixbuf loader crashes
Aug 02 13:46:26 <ebassi>	And popovers are popunders
Aug 02 13:46:51 <ebassi>	Because I need to sort them at the end of the GtkWindow get_render_node()

Aug 02 14:21:53 <baedert>	wtf
Aug 02 14:24:08 <mclasen>	ebassi: so, running GSK_DEBUG=opengl gtk3-widget-factory, I see ~13 nodes getting rendered
Aug 02 14:24:17 <mclasen>	I was expecting much more, am I missing something ?
Aug 02 14:25:06 <ebassi>	mclasen: Nope; it's just that not every widget that overrides ::draw has been ported
Aug 02 14:25:28 <ebassi>	A bunch of containers decide to chain up which is interpreted as a fallback
Aug 02 14:25:36 <mclasen>	but with GtkBox ported, shouldn't most of the widget tree be reflected in render nodes ?
Aug 02 14:26:04 <mclasen>	ah
Aug 02 14:26:12 <mclasen>	so if I see something that says Fallback<GtkFrame>
Aug 02 14:26:33 <mclasen>	that means the entire widget tree inside the frame won't show up as render nodes ?
Aug 02 14:26:35 <ebassi>	It means that everything contained inside GtkFrame is drawn to a single node
Aug 02 14:26:38 <ebassi>	Yep
Aug 02 14:27:05 <ebassi>	Working my way through the containers right now; Box was the obvious first choice because of the GtkCssGadget use
Aug 02 14:28:05 <mclasen>	I'm not sure I've seen a render node coming out of a gadget yet
Aug 02 14:28:53 <ebassi>	GtkHeaderBar should output a background and a border node
Aug 02 14:29:09 <mclasen>	right, I've seen those
Aug 02 14:29:09 <ebassi>	The log is a bit noisy with the matrices
Aug 02 14:29:17 <ebassi>	I'll split it up
Aug 02 14:30:08 <ebassi>	Bin is where things choke up because it inherits the GtkContainer::draw implementation
Aug 02 14:38:52 <mclasen>	can't it then also inherit the get_render_node implementation ?
Aug 02 14:43:23 <ebassi>	I cannot give GtkContainer a get_render_node() implementation, otherwise all GtkContainers will have it, and the fallback code that lets non-ported containers draw something will not be called
Aug 02 14:44:04 <ebassi>	But I can implement GtkBin::get_render_node()
Aug 02 14:45:26 <mclasen>	ah, ok
Aug 02 14:45:46 <mclasen>	so you're adding get_render_node implementations from the leaves of the class hierarchy upwards ?
Aug 02 14:47:33 <ebassi>	Pretty much; I'm ignoring leaf widgets right now because they would end up rendering to a texture anyway, so we can use the fallback code; I'm mostly trying to figure out a way to port containers and gadgets without adding special cases in the public API, which seems to be working

Aug 03 07:15:31 <mclasen>	the button and frame patches need more work, but the grid one is good
Aug 03 07:18:11 <ebassi>	mclasen: Yeah, I saw them; I'm going to merge the branch into mine
Aug 03 07:18:16 <ebassi>	Thanks!
Aug 03 07:18:30 <ebassi>	Any early feedback on the API?
Aug 03 07:19:55 <mclasen>	didn't really use much of it
Aug 03 07:20:42 <mclasen>	I need to sit down and actually understand the relationships between widget coordinates (allocation), gadgets, and render nodes
Aug 03 07:21:20 <ebassi>	Yeah, that's tricky; I need to write down some thought on that, and try to make it a bit more automatic
Aug 03 07:21:53 <ebassi>	There's also the whole clip != allocation thing to consider
Aug 03 07:22:24 <ebassi>	I was actually thinking of adding a function called gtk_widget_create_render_node() that set up the transformation and bounds
Aug 03 07:22:55 <mclasen>	I noticed that the 'trivial'  case basically has the same get_render_node implementation
Aug 03 07:23:14 <mclasen>	ie simple containers - you just need the gadget, and then you add the children
Aug 03 07:23:33 <mclasen>	the implementation that 'should be' gtk_container_get_render_node
Aug 03 07:24:26 <ebassi>	Yeah, we should add a gtk_container_get_render_node() that did that
Aug 03 07:24:45 <ebassi>	Or gtk_container_get_simple_render_node() :-)
Aug 03 07:25:57 <samtoday_>	Is there an idiomatic way to unfocus an entry?
Aug 03 07:26:23 <mclasen>	you can't unfocus widgets; you can only focus something else
Aug 03 07:26:50 <mclasen>	hmm
Aug 03 07:27:21 <mclasen>	jadahl: it appears we have menu placement regressions in master on wayland - is that because your part hasn't landed yet ?

Aug 03 07:28:25 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Company
Aug 03 07:30:30 <mclasen>	ebassi: the only part of that simple implementation that varies is finding the gadget
Aug 03 07:34:40 <ebassi>	Yeah, that kind of complicates things a bit
Aug 03 07:35:08 <ebassi>	Especially if we want to make that function public
Aug 03 07:55:55 <andlabs>	baedert: on Windows yes, since you have to decide what a single scrolling increment means
Aug 03 07:56:09 <andlabs>	in fact the native list box and list view controls already work like this
Aug 03 07:56:29 <andlabs>	OS X I don't think you can do it unless you effectively reimplement NSScrollView itself
Aug 03 07:56:35 <andlabs>	it works like GtkScrolledWindow
Aug 03 08:03:49 <baedert>	andlabs: How does it work on windows? Is there a GtkAdjustment equivalent? Can the increment change during scrolling does it have to stay the same?
Aug 03 08:07:12 <andlabs>	each window handle can have horizontal and vertical scrollbars provided by the system; you use the function SetScrollInfo() to set the scrolling information and actually perform scrolling in your WM_HSCROLL and WM_VSCROLL handlers
Aug 03 08:07:21 <andlabs>	the first few articles on The Old New Thing talk about it
Aug 03 08:08:14 <andlabs>	afk
Aug 03 08:11:40 <mclasen>	Company: have you looked at reftests recently ? I can't figure out why box-shadow-changes-modify-clip fails
Aug 03 08:49:20 <LRN>	something changed in latest versions of gtk?
Aug 03 08:49:47 <LRN>	it seems that gtk somehow picks up my system locale
Aug 03 08:49:56 <LRN>	that's new
Aug 03 09:09:52 <LRN>	If i create a dialog and then do "g_signal_connect (dialog, "delete-event", G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_destroy), NULL);", would it leak?
Aug 03 09:11:01 <ebassi>	LRN: Well, it would not be correct, since gtk_widget_destroy() does not have a return value and delete-event handlers expect it
Aug 03 09:11:16 <ebassi>	Also, the default delete-event handler is gtk_widget_destroy() already
Aug 03 09:22:38 <andlabs>	baedert: need any more help?
Aug 03 09:29:09 <jadahl>	mclasen: wayland uses the same method as x11, so there shouldn't be more regessions on wayland than x11 (in theory)
Aug 03 09:30:28 <baedert>	jadahl: the other day you told me that there was some private protocol that's not merged yet?
Aug 03 09:31:01 <baedert>	andlabs: I didn't really understand how that (row-based scrolling) would work from a GtkScrollable implementation
Aug 03 09:31:03 <jadahl>	baedert: indeed. except its not private
Aug 03 09:31:13 <mclasen>	jadahl: then it is probably just a regression
Aug 03 09:31:20 <jadahl>	when that has landed, and we have ported over the shell protocol to that version, we should have proper manu placement
Aug 03 09:31:29 <mclasen>	looking at widget-factory page 2, the menus pop up way too far the left
Aug 03 09:31:32 <jadahl>	now, we get "as good" as before (except there seems to be a regression)
Aug 03 09:31:42 <andlabs>	baedert: I don't know either
Aug 03 09:31:46 <andlabs>	I know I did it once, somehow
Aug 03 09:32:01 <andlabs>	I could try to dig out the code if you want
Aug 03 09:32:14 <jadahl>	mclasen: well, there was some bug olivier looked on that made thing funny on wayland but not x11, maybe its related
Aug 03 09:32:48 <jadahl>	mclasen: does it reproduce on any of the menus on testpopupat?
Aug 03 09:32:59 <mclasen>	lets try that
Aug 03 09:33:23 <jadahl>	hmm. tried it now, there seems to be some kind of regression
Aug 03 09:33:52 <jadahl>	they pop up to far to the left and to far up
Aug 03 09:34:13 <baedert>	sub menus are worse :P
Aug 03 09:34:20 <jadahl>	indeed
Aug 03 09:34:22 <mclasen>	all the menus in testpopupat seem somewhat broken
Aug 03 09:34:34 <mclasen>	the menubuttons mostly work
Aug 03 09:35:33 <jadahl>	the application menu page does not however
Aug 03 09:36:02 <mclasen>	works fine under X, afaics
Aug 03 09:36:24 <jadahl>	will take a look
Aug 03 09:36:24 <mclasen>	uh, there's more tabs
Aug 03 09:36:33 <mclasen>	this thing tests _all the menus_!
Aug 03 09:36:44 <jadahl>	yea its awesome
Aug 03 09:36:51 <jadahl>	it even has the super tall menu
Aug 03 09:36:53 <jadahl>	and super deep
Aug 03 09:38:09 <mclasen>	there's something fishy with the filechooser sidebar - don't get the context menu popover there
Aug 03 09:38:24 <jadahl>	on x11?
Aug 03 09:38:29 <mclasen>	both
Aug 03 09:38:42 <mclasen>	instead, I get something that looks like a notebook tab menu

Aug 03 09:41:26 <visarion>	I have a box with to objects in it. One of it is always shown and the other's visibility is toggled on/off. How do I make sure that the first one doesn't move when the other one is shown/not shown ?
Aug 03 09:42:29 <baedert>	you can put the second in a stack and control the visibility using that
Aug 03 10:35:19 <andlabs>	baedert: if you're still interested here's a shell archive with the code I had for line-based scrolling http://sprunge.us/QfAR but you'll have to figure it out at this point, sorry

Aug 03 12:41:19 <pmike>	Hi, not sure if this is the right place but can i make question regarding GIO (Sockets) in here?
Aug 03 12:44:06 <fmuellner>	yup
Aug 03 12:44:32 <pmike>	Ok @fmueliner, thanks.
Aug 03 12:44:53 <pmike>	I'm working on a App that runs ok on GTK3.18 but it fails on 3.20
Aug 03 12:45:38 <pmike>	been following the problem and it comes to attaching a source, or a SocketSource more precisely on to a socket
Aug 03 12:47:07 <pmike>	went to github to check gsocket.c and it seems that the g_socket_create_source has started to return null if the socket is a TCP (stream) socket instead of a UDP (Datagram)
Aug 03 12:48:53 <pmike>	i'm trying to read any document suggestion how to handle this but cannot find anything
Aug 03 12:50:02 <pmike>	the idea is, after connecting to a server, get the socket, create a source and set a callback to the IOCondition.IN
Aug 03 12:50:44 <pmike>	but the create_source will return NULL if the Socket type is TCP... Is this normal?
Aug 03 12:52:09 <pmike>	well, it wasn't but it is now. And the documentation says that the DatagramBased interface will work on both (connection oriented and connection-less) kind of streams
Aug 03 12:58:29 <pmike>	i can get more detailed if needed... my first time on IRC, *blush*
Aug 03 12:59:43 <mclasen>	I think the datagrambased stuff was done by pwithnall 
Aug 03 12:59:49 <mclasen>	maybe he can chime in
Aug 03 13:00:14 <pwithnall>	hello
Aug 03 13:00:18 <pmike>	Hi
Aug 03 13:01:10 *	pwithnall takes a look at the code
Aug 03 13:01:20 <pmike>	thanks @mclasen and @pwithnall
Aug 03 13:03:14 <nicknameitis>	is it possible to invoke gtk-inspector from my code with already specific object selected?
Aug 03 13:03:26 <pwithnall>	pmike: I don’t see how it’s possible for g_socket_create_source() to return NULL
Aug 03 13:03:50 <pwithnall>	unless you’re violating one of its preconditions, in which case you should get a critical warning
Aug 03 13:05:33 <pmike>	pwithnall: thanks for your time. What i'm doing it's simple, use g_socket_client to connect and get a g_socket_connection
Aug 03 13:05:52 <pmike>	from the g_socket_connection, get the g_socket
Aug 03 13:06:30 <baedert>	nicknameitis: no
Aug 03 13:06:55 <pmike>	then i try to create a source, from the socket, g_socket_create_source with IOCondition IN
Aug 03 13:07:07 <pmike>	but it return null
Aug 03 13:07:53 <pwithnall>	pmike: have you checked that the GSocket is non-NULL?
Aug 03 13:07:55 <nicknameitis>	baedert: this sucks, i'll have to reinvent whole thing. thanks
Aug 03 13:08:07 <pwithnall>	because that’s the only reason I can see for g_socket_create_source() to return NULL
Aug 03 13:08:14 <pmike>	yes, it's non-null
Aug 03 13:09:05 <pmike>	with gtk 3.18 (fedora 23) it's working but fails on gtk 3.20 (fedora 24)
Aug 03 13:10:47 <pmike>	on gsocket.c has a condition now "if (!check_datagram_based (self, null)) return NULL;
Aug 03 13:11:45 <pmike>	and this function will return false on: case G_SOCKET_TYPE_STREAM
Aug 03 13:12:25 <pwithnall>	pmike: You’re calling g_datagram_based_create_source(), not g_socket_create_source()?
Aug 03 13:12:31 <pmike>	pwithnall: i'm not sure, i was just trying to figure out why... i may be wrong on my assumptions
Aug 03 13:13:43 <pmike>	well, i'm using Vala, let me check which one is being called on thec generated file
Aug 03 13:14:19 <pwithnall>	g_datagram_based_create_source() is what’s being called
Aug 03 13:14:48 <pwithnall>	The code is correct, and the documentation which says GDatagramBased works for connection-oriented and connection-less objects is also correct, although not especially helpful
Aug 03 13:15:08 <pwithnall>	GDatagramBased explicitly does not work with stream-based objects, such as TCP connections
Aug 03 13:15:35 <pmike>	yes and i understand the logic
Aug 03 13:15:40 <pwithnall>	Note that you can have a connection-oriented, non-stream-based connection: SCTP is an example
Aug 03 13:15:46 <pwithnall>	I’ll clarify that documentation
Aug 03 13:16:34 <pmike>	yes, i know but i'm using TCP and the set_callback on a socket seems to appear only on the GDatagramBased interface
Aug 03 13:17:25 <pwithnall>	You mean the create_source() only seems to appear on the GDatagramBased interface?
Aug 03 13:18:04 <pwithnall>	My Vala is rusty, but I think the following should work:
Aug 03 13:18:17 <pwithnall>	(my_socket_variable as GLib.Socket).create_source(…)
Aug 03 13:19:02 <pmike>	http://www.valadate.org:8000/#!api=gio-2.0/GLib.Socket
Aug 03 13:19:34 <pmike>	the create_source method moved to the DatagramBased interface
Aug 03 13:19:45 <pmike>	maybe it's a vala/valac problem
Aug 03 13:19:58 <smcv>	if a class C implements an interface I
Aug 03 13:20:08 <smcv>	and both C and I have a create_source() method
Aug 03 13:20:22 <smcv>	I would expect my_C_instance.create_source() to mean C.create_source, not I.create_source
Aug 03 13:20:41 <smcv>	just from a general argument of "interfaces are a bit like base classes"
Aug 03 13:20:49 <smcv>	but perhaps Vala doesn't follow that rule
Aug 03 13:21:33 <pwithnall>	it might require an override
Aug 03 13:21:40 <smcv>	if Vala doesn't do that, it seems like a recipe for accidental API changes - implementing a new interface shouldn't make your Vala API magically change
Aug 03 13:21:52 <smcv>	surely?
Aug 03 13:22:19 <pwithnall>	pmike: I think you need to file a bug against Vala; this definitely looks like a Vala bug to me
Aug 03 13:22:44 <pmike>	i also come from gtk/glib on C but i'm on a project, alone, and i needed to speedup the coding so i turned to vala
Aug 03 13:23:08 <smcv>	you had a problem, you solved it with vala, and now you have a different problem
Aug 03 13:23:17 <smcv>	not an unfamiliar story tbh
Aug 03 13:23:43 <pmike>	ok, just check the 3.18 c and 3.20
Aug 03 13:24:02 <pmike>	the 3.20 it's using g_datagram_based_create_cource
Aug 03 13:24:07 <pmike>	*source
Aug 03 13:25:19 <pmike>	i must check with the vala guys then, thanks pwithnall and smcv
Aug 03 13:25:26 <pwithnall>	np
Aug 03 13:25:29 <pmike>	sorry fot the time taken
Aug 03 13:25:30 <pwithnall>	Good luck
Aug 03 13:25:39 <pmike>	thanks ;) keep up the good work 
Aug 03 14:21:01 <LRN>	when is the next gtk release?
Aug 03 14:21:39 <mclasen>	you mean the next devel snapshot, or the next stable release ?
Aug 03 14:21:49 <LRN>	stable
Aug 03 14:22:02 <LRN>	roadmap doesn't seem to have any dates anymore
Aug 03 14:23:12 <mclasen>	not sure it ever had forward-looking dates
Aug 03 14:23:22 <mclasen>	anyway, Sep 21
Aug 03 14:24:02 <LRN>	okay
Aug 03 14:30:20 <jmd>	How do I define accelerators in a GMenuModel ?
Aug 03 14:47:27 <jmd>	I have tried to set a keyboard accelerator in my app like this:    const gchar *xx[]={"<Ctrl>Q", 0};
Aug 03 14:47:27 <jmd>	  gtk_application_set_accels_for_action (GTK_APPLICATION (app), "quit", xx);
Aug 03 14:47:27 <jmd>	 
Aug 03 14:47:42 <jmd>	But it doesn't seem to do anything.  What have I missed?
Aug 03 14:51:56 <mclasen>	impossible to answer that. compare https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/examples/bp/bloatpad.c for a working example

Aug 04 01:41:32 <kung>	I have a GtkVBox, which has a statusbar, which is always at bottom, tho I wanna add a widget after it, but the new widget is always added before
Aug 04 01:41:41 <kung>	is this a pack-type "issue"?
Aug 04 01:41:49 <kung>	I tried: gtk_container_child_set(GTK_CONTAINER(gtk_widget_get_parent(statusbar)), statusbar, "pack-type", GTK_PACK_START, NULL);

Aug 04 01:47:31 <kung>	LRN, oh thanks for the glade tip, I just realized in glade that pack-type means something different what I thought xD
Aug 04 01:48:18 <kung>	I thought it's forcing a widget to be always "last" in box, but it actually just means it located at bottom 
Aug 04 01:49:37 <kung>	oh or not

Aug 04 06:43:47 <mclasen>	ebassi: I tracked down the headerbar positioning
Aug 04 06:44:37 <ebassi>	mclasen: Oh, thanks; was going over the coordinate space issues today — spent some time in the profiler yesterday
Aug 04 06:46:57 <mclasen>	pushed a possible fix in my branch
Aug 04 06:47:35 <ebassi>	Cool, I'm looking at it right now
Aug 04 06:48:58 <ebassi>	I wonder if we shouldn't just add the offset to the transformation matrix when setting it up
Aug 04 06:49:24 <ebassi>	But I'll have a got at it
Aug 04 06:49:26 <ebassi>	Thanks again!
Aug 04 06:51:04 *	ebassi needs to figure out why the first frame on hidpi is painted correctly and every other frame is not
Aug 04 06:51:36 <mclasen>	there may be other places where we need to handle the clip / allocation discrepancy
Aug 04 06:52:26 <mclasen>	I haven't looked at what the css render nodes do wrt to outer shadows, e.g
Aug 04 06:56:08 <ebassi>	In theory, that's what the bounds.origin should do — an additional translation applied when rendering. I'm likely not applying it correctly, especially when it's negative.
Aug 04 06:56:48 <mclasen>	the problem I found is that gtk_widget_get_render_node sets it right
Aug 04 06:57:01 <mclasen>	and gtk_container_propagate_render_nodes overrides it wrong
Aug 04 06:58:04 <mclasen>	splitting out that offset was a way to avoid that interference
Aug 04 06:58:20 <ebassi>	Likely something I misunderstood from the code in gtk_container_propagate_draw()
Aug 04 06:59:04 <mclasen>	no, I think the code is right
Aug 04 06:59:24 <mclasen>	it positions children according to their allocation
Aug 04 06:59:56 <mclasen>	just that when you have a nontrivial clip, the top left corner of the allocation can not be where you position your surface, in must extend beyond that
Aug 04 07:04:17 <ebassi>	The "bounds" of a GskRenderNode are the equivalent of the clip - the renderable area, including an eventual offset to be applied on top of the transformation of the top-left corner. Render nodes also have a child transform, which is applied to children only, on top of their own transformation.
Aug 04 07:04:31 <ebassi>	Containers should undo the clip offset as part of the child transformation
Aug 04 07:04:59 <ebassi>	So that children get drawn where their allocation is, but their renderable area can have a different offset
Aug 04 07:05:43 <ebassi>	Would that make sense?
Aug 04 07:07:25 <mclasen>	I briefly looked at the child transform, but couldn't see any use of it; I guess that would work fine
Aug 04 07:07:42 <mclasen>	although I'm not sure in what sense one of these transform is 'child' and the other isn't
Aug 04 08:41:16 <rrika>	Is it acceptable to call XGetWindowProperty on the UI thread?
Aug 04 08:41:39 <rrika>	I was wondering if there was an asynchronous version of this
Aug 04 08:55:39 <baedert>	Does the GtkCssValue redefinition in all the c files also confuse gdb?
Aug 04 09:06:48 <ebassi>	rrika: You can only call it inside the GUI thread; any other use is undefined behaviour
Aug 04 09:06:58 <ebassi>	rrika: XCB has asynchronous variants
Aug 04 09:07:39 <rrika>	gtk/gdk uses xlib, right? so I can't use xcb on the same connection, right?
Aug 04 09:10:35 <mclasen>	why are you worried about XGetWindowProperty being sync ?
Aug 04 09:12:00 <rrika>	I'm just generally wary about everything that's sync on a UI thread. I didn't bench anything.
Aug 04 09:12:08 <rrika>	If it's not a problem in practice then that's fine too.
Aug 04 09:14:03 <mclasen>	its not something I would worry about

Aug 04 09:16:08 <rrika>	okay
Aug 04 09:20:10 <Redfoxmoon>	...
Aug 04 09:20:41 <Redfoxmoon>	Is there anything in glib's build system with regards to libtool causing race conditions?
Aug 04 09:21:32 *	mclasen not sure how anyone would answer that
Aug 04 09:23:18 <xjuan>	fmuellner: hola!, how are you? did you have time to take a look at the issue I mention the other day?
Aug 04 09:23:23 <andlabs>	question for others I guess http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38765080/delete-the-automatic-popover-shown-on-gtk-entry
Aug 04 09:23:34 <andlabs>	never heard of this before
Aug 04 09:23:35 <fmuellner>	xjuan: no, sorry
Aug 04 09:23:48 <xjuan>	no problem, do you have any pointers?
Aug 04 09:24:17 <baedert>	andlabs: that should only appear if a touchscreen is in use and in that case can't be deleted.
Aug 04 09:28:25 <mclasen>	more precisely, it should only appear if the entry sees touch events
Aug 04 09:28:38 <mclasen>	I don't think we show it on focus-in
Aug 04 09:30:30 <Redfoxmoon>	mclasen, was that /me for me? :p
Aug 04 09:30:39 <mclasen>	yes
Aug 04 09:30:54 <Redfoxmoon>	right, so...asking because there's a new C implementation of libtool
Aug 04 09:31:09 <Redfoxmoon>	which, when used with glib causes race conditions
Aug 04 09:31:12 <mclasen>	first time I hear about it, have a pointer ?
Aug 04 09:31:19 <Redfoxmoon>	*only* glib, no other packages
Aug 04 09:31:22 <Redfoxmoon>	Oh, right, yes, sec
Aug 04 09:31:51 <Redfoxmoon>	mclasen, http://midipix.org/ http://git.midipix.org/cgit.cgi/slibtool
Aug 04 09:31:53 <mclasen>	but my basic take on that would be: you replaced one piece in a very complicated puzzle, and now there's a problem... I would start by looking at the new piece
Aug 04 09:31:53 <Redfoxmoon>	:-)
Aug 04 09:32:05 <Redfoxmoon>	oh, it's been looked into a lot..
Aug 04 09:32:31 <Redfoxmoon>	a bunch of race conditions have been fixed, but glib remains
Aug 04 09:33:43 <mclasen>	on a meta-level I think replacing libtool with a new implementation is missing the larger picture...
Aug 04 09:34:01 <mclasen>	the problem with libtool is not so much that it is written in shell
Aug 04 09:34:07 <bugbot>	bugzilla@tecnocode.co.uk changed the Status on bug 769507 from NEW --- to RESOLVED FIXED.

Aug 04 09:34:08 <mclasen>	but that it shouldn't really exist in the first place
Aug 04 09:40:41 <Redfoxmoon>	mclasen, it does exist, and has limitations
Aug 04 09:40:59 <Redfoxmoon>	like being unable to make shared libraries when cross compiling, slibtool doesn't care about that
Aug 04 09:41:02 <Redfoxmoon>	speed, etc
Aug 04 09:41:18 <Redfoxmoon>	of course if we COULD remove libtool from existence, that would be the best solution; but we can't
Aug 04 09:44:32 <smcv>	"unable to make shared libraries when cross compiling" [citation needed]
Aug 04 09:44:54 <Redfoxmoon>	smcv, just try building a library with libtool for midipix by cross compilation.
Aug 04 09:44:58 <Redfoxmoon>	you will not get a shared library :-)
Aug 04 09:45:05 <smcv>	I have no idea what midipix is
Aug 04 09:45:17 <smcv>	but every libdbus commit builds shared libraries for Windows on travis-ci
Aug 04 09:45:25 <Redfoxmoon>	libtool goes "hmmm....I don't know this platform, therefore no shared libraries!"
Aug 04 09:45:35 <Redfoxmoon>	midipix is a POSIX layer for windows
Aug 04 09:45:44 <Redfoxmoon>	unlike cygwin, it doesn't suck :-)
Aug 04 09:46:02 <smcv>	if you take a tool that contains knowledge of platform-specific quirks
Aug 04 09:46:12 <smcv>	and try to use it for a platform it doesn't know about
Aug 04 09:46:18 <Redfoxmoon>	it shouldn't matter
Aug 04 09:46:19 <smcv>	you are not going to have a good time
Aug 04 09:46:25 <Redfoxmoon>	uhm.
Aug 04 09:46:37 <Redfoxmoon>	libtool shouldn't go to a "known list for shared libraries"
Aug 04 09:46:53 <smcv>	knowing which hoops you need to jump through to get a shared library, on which platforms, is exactly the point of libtool
Aug 04 09:46:53 <Redfoxmoon>	it COULD check against a list of broken platforms, sure
Aug 04 09:47:09 <Redfoxmoon>	normal PE target
Aug 04 09:47:23 <Redfoxmoon>	"libtool: different triplet, therefore NOPE."
Aug 04 09:47:26 <Redfoxmoon>	uh.
Aug 04 09:47:27 <smcv>	now, perhaps the world has got better since libtool started, and "most" relevant platforms can be lumped into equivalence classes
Aug 04 09:47:39 <Redfoxmoon>	it has AFAIK
Aug 04 09:47:45 <Redfoxmoon>	most platforms are sane :(
Aug 04 09:50:15 <andlabs>	what do you mean
Aug 04 09:50:20 <andlabs>	we still need to support xenix and 2.2BSD
Aug 04 09:50:32 <Redfoxmoon>	:-)
Aug 04 09:50:44 <Redfoxmoon>	trololo
Aug 04 09:51:32 <andlabs>	when will gtk3 for amiga workbench be out =P
Aug 04 09:51:41 <mclasen>	anyway, to get back to the beginning of this discussion, I think showing the failure you see might be more productive than asking about race conditions in general
Aug 04 09:59:49 <gnunn>	I've got a user complaining about huge icons in GTK 3.16 when using my app. The app uses custom SVG icons and only my custom icons are showing up huge, the icons taken from the theme are the correct size. Any chance this is a known issue in GTK 3.16? Here's my bug report: https://github.com/gnunn1/terminix/issues/428
Aug 04 10:01:01 <gnunn>	I went through bugzilla and while there are some bug reports for huge icons they all seem to be all or nothing, i.e. all icons are huge, whereas in my case some icons are huge some are normal
Aug 04 10:01:47 <baedert>	gnunn: are you storing symbolic icons in scalable/?
Aug 04 10:02:30 <gnunn>	baedert: They are in a scaleable folder in my resource file yes. It works fine in other GTK versions as far as I can tell
Aug 04 10:03:13 <baedert>	gnunn: opensuse sets the min size of scalable/ to 64px
Aug 04 10:03:30 <baedert>	you have to use symbolic/ for symbolics
Aug 04 10:03:49 <baedert>	which increases the icon theme spec whatever package version you need because symbolic/ only exists in the latest version
Aug 04 10:04:07 <baedert>	... which you can work around by using symbolic pngs
Aug 04 10:04:22 <gnunn>	baedert: I think mine are smaller then that
Aug 04 10:04:47 <baedert>	then 32, doesn't matter
Aug 04 10:05:02 <baedert>	https://github.com/baedert/corebird/issues/451
Aug 04 10:05:52 <gnunn>	baedert: Thanks very much for that link, this saves me a ton of time in trying to figure out the problem!
Aug 04 10:07:48 <baedert>	gnunn: The end result was https://github.com/baedert/corebird/commit/84a11623e24ac3bd58a86847b7262d373005eb53 ...
Aug 04 10:10:06 <gnunn>	baedert: OK, that seems pretty reasonable. Thanks again for this, saves me a ton of time
Aug 04 10:17:44 <Redfoxmoon>	mclasen, will try do that later and post the log
Aug 04 10:42:50 <al>	can a GSocket of type G_SOCKET_TYPE_STREAM be used with g_dtls_server_connection_new ?

Aug 04 11:41:17 <baedert>	Company: Also, totally unrelated, but do you want to look into bug 763517? :)
Aug 04 11:41:18 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=763517 .General, normal, gtk-bugs, NEEDINFO , Selected sidebar item in file chooser briefly has wrong color on cursor leave
Aug 04 11:43:58 <al>	thanks pmike, i dont' think GSocket should implement GDatagramBased interface. Not all sockets are DatagramBased, e.g. TCP.
Aug 04 11:44:00 <al>	There should be a new object GDatagramBasedSocket that inherits from GSocket and implements GDatagramBased. This will GError if try to create TCP socket with it. The changes to GSocket are causing problems with Vala. The idea of a conditional interface based on constructor argument is dubious in my view
Aug 04 11:52:11 <pwithnall>	al: It’s not a conditional interface, it’s an interface which will return an error if you call its methods on a stream-based socket
Aug 04 11:52:29 <pwithnall>	It’s no worse than socket() being a gateway to all sorts of different types of connections with totally different semantics
Aug 04 11:53:04 <pwithnall>	and I suspect less painful than having a DatagramBased and StreamBased copy of a lot of classes and interfaces
Aug 04 11:53:54 <pwithnall>	But to answer your original question, as pmike said: you cannot use a stream-based socket with GDtlsServerConnection
Aug 04 11:54:03 <pwithnall>	It will throw errors as soon as you try sending or receiving data
Aug 04 11:54:21 <al>	hmm, if it errors then it doesn't implement the method so it is not implementing the interface. my understanding was that GObject brought OOP methods to C. this seems like a corruption of that
Aug 04 11:55:25 <al>	and makes it difficult for bindings
Aug 04 11:55:56 <al>	what purpose does the interface serve?
Aug 04 11:57:55 <DimStar>	Hi all. the fresh 3.20.7 tarball is 'broken' insofar that it requires an unstable glib2 version due to https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/configure.ac?h=gtk-3-20&id=a01ee5a7b0a9a7170d4be3c64314ee51dd502cab
Aug 04 12:47:01 <nacho_>	LRN, sorry for the late response

Aug 04 12:48:49 <mclasen>	DimStar: arr, I meant to skip that
Aug 04 12:49:17 <DimStar>	mclasen: I was pretty sure you did not mean to require an unstale glib in stable gtk
Aug 04 12:50:29 <mclasen>	reverted
Aug 04 12:51:05 <DimStar>	will you do a new release tarball or shall I just revert it in the packages too?
Aug 04 12:51:21 <mclasen>	let me do that quickly
Aug 04 13:15:47 <heftig>	mclasen: gtk 3.20.7 depends on glib 2.29.1
Aug 04 13:15:56 <heftig>	er, 2.49.1

Aug 04 15:19:27 <tobias47n9e>	What is the GTK locale for Dari language? fa_AF does not seem to work.
Aug 04 15:21:32 <mclasen>	we do have a fa.po
Aug 04 15:24:07 <tobias47n9e>	mclasen, fa starts with RTL but fa_AF not. Is that maybe a bug?
Aug 04 15:25:08 <mclasen>	both fa and fa_AF come up in rtl here
Aug 04 15:26:14 <tobias47n9e>	mclasen, Thanks. I guess then it is an issue on my side
Aug 04 15:27:02 <mclasen>	how are you setting it ? my guess would be that setlocale fails for one of your two tries
Aug 04 15:34:38 <jmd>	What's the shift key called in Variant speak?
Aug 04 15:37:03 <tobias47n9e>	mclasen, Now I know what the problem is. fa_AF in Windows 7 is prs_AF
Aug 04 15:37:39 <tobias47n9e>	I will have to catch all of these differing local labels
Aug 04 15:37:55 <mclasen>	ugh

Aug 04 16:06:31 <tonyctl>	is it possible to hide a gtk window with css?
Aug 04 16:27:34 <hergertme>	tonyctl: no
Aug 04 16:28:13 <tonyctl>	can I make it transparent enough to be invisible?
Aug 04 16:28:42 <hergertme>	you might need to make sure it has an rgba visual (although maybe that is default by now?)
Aug 04 16:29:54 <hergertme>	hrmm, setting the opacity property works for me, but not window { opacity: 0.3 }
Aug 04 16:30:07 <hergertme>	probably due to visuals

Aug 04 17:42:58 <garnacho>	b4n: yeah, I'll push to gtk-3-20 too, not sure the previous will get that much further attention
Aug 04 17:43:38 <b4n>	well, I would hope for things like Ubuntu to update to a newer 3.18 if it happened
Aug 04 17:44:02 <b4n>	maybe I'm too optimistic about them, but well
Aug 04 17:50:07 <rudrab>	Do I must have a liststore defined for this?
Aug 04 17:53:19 <b4n>	rudrab: if you don't have a liststore how do you use the renderer?  but no, you can g_object_set(renderer, "pixbuf", pixbuf, NULL);
Aug 04 18:11:49 <rudrab>	b4n: like this: https://paste.gnome.org/pdxowpffm

Aug 05 02:38:55 <rudrab>	I am trying https://paste.gnome.org/pps9ccnwe
Aug 05 02:40:19 <TingPing>	rudrab, just make two renderers and pack them both in
Aug 05 02:40:40 <TingPing>	rudrab, an example: https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/treeview.html#the-view
Aug 05 02:41:54 <rudrab>	TingPing: I am trying to do that ...the problem is, is it possible to load data to cellrenderer without a liststore? e.g. set_property?
Aug 05 02:42:20 <rudrab>	see the code please
Aug 05 02:43:50 <TingPing>	rudrab, sure, but the property you want is probably "icon-name"

Aug 05 02:50:28 <rudrab>	https://paste.gnome.org/phmomfmiv is what I am trying to do....a cellrenderercombo. The icons is working great, but that is not clickable
Aug 05 02:51:33 <rudrab>	I am trying to get the icon clickable, not the text (both is ok)
Aug 05 02:51:54 <TingPing>	is the text clickable?
Aug 05 02:52:51 <rudrab>	yes
Aug 05 02:53:32 <rudrab>	when i click the text, the on_combo_changed works
Aug 05 02:53:35 <TingPing>	hmm, well im not certain the best solution, but you could probably just connect to the clicked signal of the treeview and if its the icon activate the combo instead
Aug 05 02:56:53 <rudrab>	hmm...already did that...unfortunately CellRendererPixbuf does not have a clicled/edited signal
Aug 05 02:57:08 <TingPing>	that is why i sad the treeview
Aug 05 03:00:28 <rudrab>	Actually it should open a cellrenderercombo

Aug 05 07:17:51 <mclasen>	I may look at it a bit
Aug 05 07:18:00 <mclasen>	we may just be clipping them away
Aug 05 07:18:16 <ebassi>	Yeah, it's probably a case of missing clip
Aug 05 07:18:31 <ebassi>	i.e. using the allocation instead of the clip to determine the size of the node
Aug 05 07:18:52 <ebassi>	The frame rendering is also a bit bust: the label is drawn over the frame border

Aug 05 22:56:42 <jmd>	Where is the format for the attribute name="accel" properties of GMenuModel documented ?
Aug 06 03:00:59 <rudrab>	Hi, given the CellRendererCombo remains almost hidden (no visual for presence of a combo, eg. dropdown arrow of a normal combobox), I am trying to add a pixbuf in the same cell
Aug 06 03:01:28 <rudrab>	e.g. https://paste.gnome.org/ptnqluhzf
Aug 06 03:02:09 <rudrab>	problem is the cellrendererpixbuf is not clickable. any idea how to use it?
Aug 06 03:05:25 <rudrab>	http://picpaste.com/Screenshot_from_2016-08-06_09-02-41-kxfR8zgu.png is how my corresponding treeviewcolumn is. 
Aug 06 03:05:59 <TingPing>	rudrab, the index is what has a combo?
Aug 06 03:06:11 <rudrab>	yes
Aug 06 03:06:32 <TingPing>	rudrab, seems like drag n drop is a better way to set an order than a combobox
Aug 06 03:07:02 <TingPing>	though i suppose it might be resortable
Aug 06 03:08:47 <rudrab>	so, you mean there is no easy way to make the pixbuf clickable (or the full TreeViewColumn)?
Aug 06 03:09:39 <TingPing>	well i told you an option yesterday
Aug 06 03:11:29 <rudrab>	TingPing:True, but was not very clear to me..as you can see, I am still fighting
Aug 06 03:14:42 <rudrab>	I have tried making the column clickable. as column_combo.connect("clicked", self.on_combo_changed)
Aug 06 03:14:49 <rudrab>	but no effect
Aug 06 03:15:38 <TingPing>	rudrab, well, at a glance the rough details is, 'button-press-event' of the view, then get_path_at_pos(), somehow get that to a cellrenderer, and call activate() on the combo
Aug 06 03:16:48 <TingPing>	if i were you i just wouldn't shove an icon there, i don't think it makes it much more clear
Aug 06 03:17:10 <TingPing>	if the view isn't sortable, just enable drag n drop and that solves that
Aug 06 03:24:59 <rudrab>	TingPing: tell me one thing, plz
Aug 06 03:26:00 <rudrab>	The TreeViewColumn is clickable; and I have added one more widget(the cellpixbuf) to the column. 
Aug 06 03:26:28 <rudrab>	So, should it not have the properties of the treeviewcolumn?
Aug 06 03:27:19 <TingPing>	clickability of columns refers to the header
Aug 06 03:28:09 <TingPing>	as the docs say: http://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/index.html#Gtk-3.0/classes/TreeViewColumn.html#Gtk.TreeViewColumn.props.clickable
Aug 06 03:34:31 <rudrab>	one last help: is it possible to make the pixbuf clickable, not the int itself?
Aug 06 06:19:21 <heftig>	qt5, chrome and firefox can all display colored emoji, now just gtk seems be missing here
Aug 06 06:45:55 <jmd>	heftig: Gtk+ copes well with colours for me.
Aug 06 06:46:10 <heftig>	jmd: perhaps that is new in 3.21
Aug 06 06:46:34 <jmd>	Err.  I think it's been like that at least since 2.0
Aug 06 06:46:47 <jmd>	Maybe you have a configuration issue.
Aug 06 06:47:17 <heftig>	wat
Aug 06 06:48:00 <heftig>	jmd: i'm pretty sure this is a problem that goes deep down the stack into cairo, which can't load colored glyphs
Aug 06 06:48:12 <heftig>	that is, colored glyphs are converted to grayscale
Aug 06 06:48:52 <jmd>	I don't know about that.  There are so many different standards for fonts.
Aug 06 06:49:27 <heftig>	i'm having that behavior with both "Noto Color Emoji" and "Apple Color Emoji"
Aug 06 06:49:42 <jmd>	I don't know what they are.
Aug 06 06:52:04 <heftig>	jmd: emoji fonts
Aug 06 06:53:33 <jmd>	Again, I'm not a font expert.  But I know there are so many "standards" and non-standards for fonts, so you could be right.  Perhaps this particular class of font is not fully supported.
Aug 06 06:53:56 <TingPing>	heftig, behdad has certainly mentioned it, no clue if anything came from that
Aug 06 06:54:48 <heftig>	jmd: you do know what i'm talking about?
Aug 06 06:55:29 <jmd>	I guess the thing is, if some random person suddenly announces "Hey! I have invented a new standard for fonts", it is unreasonable to expect the Gtk devs to drop everything and suddenly implement that standard.
Aug 06 06:55:32 <TingPing>	heftig, https://lists.cairographics.org/archives/cairo/2016-April/027357.html
Aug 06 06:56:34 <heftig>	jmd: no, the colored glyph loading is implemented in freetype
Aug 06 06:56:45 <heftig>	TingPing: thanks
Aug 06 07:42:11 <hadess>	heftig, you should read my blog post, which explains the different font standards, and how to get colour emojis in gtk+
Aug 06 10:24:33 *	ChanServ sets mode +q on #gtk+ Company
Aug 06 10:24:33 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Company
Aug 06 11:55:40 <ic2000>	ah found the right channel. i've just got a little question; how is the performance of gtk applications on windows? i've heard it has a bad reputation and i'm just here to confirm if it's as slow as people say
Aug 06 12:55:01 <pmike>	ic2000: not sure what you mean by slow, just try, for example, gimp on windows and take your conclusions
Aug 06 13:00:49 <ic2000>	pmike, yeah i've used it quite a lot. the loading times are quite slow, i'm not sure if this is gtks fault or the application design itself
Aug 06 13:01:27 <pmike>	is your pc old somehow? other software runs good quit?
Aug 06 13:02:22 <baedert>	gimp startup times are long because of all the plugins etc.
Aug 06 13:02:24 <pmike>	in my experiencie i see no difference but there are many variables that can change ones experience
Aug 06 13:04:30 <ic2000>	pmike, nah my pc is definitely not old lol - another thing is photoshop loads twice as fast. but i think baedert's conclusion could be the case
Aug 06 13:05:25 <pmike>	indeed, instead of the loading, check how the application performs while working, does it seems slow? slow rendering?, slow mouse and high cpu?
Aug 06 13:05:41 <baedert>	... and then remember that gimp is gtk2
Aug 06 13:05:48 <pmike>	exactly
Aug 06 13:06:42 <ic2000>	pmike, apart from the loading and some certain art options (like cubify) it works fine
Aug 06 13:06:53 <ic2000>	i was also told to use gtk2 over gtk3 as it's less bloated?
Aug 06 13:07:39 <baedert>	mitch: ... which reminds me that I have a rebased version of the gtk3-port branch (with a few additional commits). The rebase is not perfect and needed a fixup later but not sure how important that is to you
Aug 06 13:07:42 <pmike>	some plugins are cpu intensive, it's normal. Also, dont forget that gimp, unlike photoshop, it's not a commercial grade software, there are differences
Aug 06 13:08:39 <baedert>	ic2000: if you never ever want to change your codebase, gtk2 is perfect
Aug 06 13:09:26 <ic2000>	baedert, i don't have a codebase :) i'm looking for a gui lib to use. it's either learn C++ and use Qt, or use gtk and C
Aug 06 13:09:31 <ic2000>	i really don't want to learn C++ atm
Aug 06 13:09:41 <pmike>	ic2000: depends on your goals with gtk
Aug 06 13:10:04 <pmike>	ic2000: gtk has bindings to a lot of languages
Aug 06 13:10:30 <pmike>	dont need to go to gtkmm
Aug 06 13:10:53 <baedert>	if less "bloat" is you only goal you might as well just use ncurses.
Aug 06 13:11:05 <pmike>	xD
Aug 06 13:44:36 <mitch>	baedert: i meant to rebase it soon, too, dunno what is "not perfect", but maybe you can drop me the additional commits?
Aug 06 13:46:04 <mitch>	ic2000: when somebody says "bloat", stop listening to them
Aug 06 13:58:22 <baedert>	mitch: well there's one "Fix build" commit after the rebase :)
Aug 06 13:58:49 <mitch>	baedert: i guess i'll hit that myself
Aug 06 14:13:21 <baedert>	mitch: https://paste.xinu.at/m-OeLL/ Some of those are silly but 0252 was particularly tricky to track down.
Aug 06 14:18:40 <arun>	Hi, I'm usig a flowbox and am backaging a boxes in it, each box has itself several boxes again. When I use the cursors to move around, I would like it to only iterate over the flowbox children, but it also goes a level deeper and iterates over the box children... how do I disable this?

Aug 07 15:17:14 <fahrvergnugen>	In C, I'd make a greasources.xml file to put gtk/menus-appmenu.ui and gtk/menus-traditional.ui to choose the menus intelligently depending on whether we're in GNOME 3 or some other GUI.  How do you do the same in a dynamic-language binding like PyGObject?
Aug 07 15:28:09 <fahrvergnugen>	hmm; looks like you can compile to a gresource file instead of a .c and .h file ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30308748/what-is-a-resource-path-that-have-to-be-used-with-gtk-builder-new-from-resource )
Aug 07 15:29:06 <fahrvergnugen>	It would be even better if you could just have it as a constant string in your program; any way to do that, but still have it intelligently choose which one based on desktop environment?

Aug 07 17:05:20 <Creak>	*its
Aug 07 17:08:00 <kung>	Creak, does the label or box expand? Maybe set padding to 0
Aug 07 17:09:39 <Creak>	kung: the box expand for sure, I suppose it's because of the content of the label. I'll try to make a small test to understand the problem
Aug 07 17:10:22 <kung>	What often helps is to to rebuild the layout in Glade and play with the options
Aug 07 17:11:18 <Creak>	yeah, I'm forking an existing project that didn't use Glade to do the layout (I plan to do that in a later improvement ;))

Aug 08 05:22:59 <rudrab>	Hi, I am trying to update the HeaderBar when a file is opened,  with the filename, as https://paste.gnome.org/p55uziash
Aug 08 05:24:02 <rudrab>	But it seems, I cant access the headerbar from the calling function, though it is defined global. Is it possible to update the headerbar dynamically?
Aug 08 05:39:45 <TingPing>	rudrab, sure you could, i think even window.set_title() still works
Aug 08 05:41:27 <TingPing>	rudrab, using globals is a poor way to pass around information though, i think it is just a question of a cleaner design. your MenuManager class sounds like an oddity
Aug 08 05:43:50 <rudrab>	TingPing: I guess, that is the problem. my Window class imports MenuManager. So, I can't find a way to get the window/headerbar variable from Window to MenuManager
Aug 08 05:45:01 <TingPing>	rudrab, the 'modern' way to do menus is with GAction and GMenu, so i think you should probably look into that for a cleaner design
Aug 08 05:46:00 <rudrab>	TingPing: thats true, and I have done this way. The MenuManager is actually the filechooserdialogs
Aug 08 05:46:39 <TingPing>	is your project hosted anywhere so i could have useful context?
Aug 08 05:47:24 <rudrab>	a older version is in github, but i can commit it now
Aug 08 05:47:35 <rudrab>	just give me few second
Aug 08 05:49:13 <rudrab>	TingPing: https://github.com/rudrab/mkbib
Aug 08 05:51:30 <TingPing>	very weird design
Aug 08 05:53:42 <rudrab>	TingPing: Thats might be true. I am from fortran background, and possibly that reflects in my python, too
Aug 08 05:54:43 <TingPing>	rudrab, the actions apply to the window.. so the actions should be within the context of the window
Aug 08 05:55:05 <TingPing>	rudrab, MenuManager 1) has nothing to do with menus, 2) is a subclass of Gtk.Window.. for no reason
Aug 08 05:55:17 <TingPing>	it just moves window logic to another file to complicate things
Aug 08 05:55:33 <TingPing>	rudrab, also in general i think Gtk lends itself better to inheritance than composition
Aug 08 05:56:38 <TingPing>	rudrab, also random note gi.require_version() has to be called before importing.. otherwise its meaningless
Aug 08 05:57:16 <rudrab>	TingPing: so, you think, contents of  MenuManager should be inside Window class?
Aug 08 05:57:38 <TingPing>	its a window action, yes it should be within the window class
Aug 08 05:58:16 <rudrab>	ah..ok. I guess, that will solve a lots of problems
Aug 08 06:00:04 <TingPing>	rudrab, also blocking IO on the main thread is no good, check out Gio for async reading files and whatnot
Aug 08 06:01:52 <rudrab>	blocking IO on the main? you mean the Gtk.events_pending?
Aug 08 06:02:48 <TingPing>	with open(...): read()
Aug 08 06:02:59 <TingPing>	that blocks the UI thread freezing the application
Aug 08 06:05:23 <TingPing>	rudrab, also if you are fiddling with events_pending() you are probably doing something wrong in the first place
Aug 08 06:06:08 <TingPing>	ah yea http
Aug 08 06:06:28 <TingPing>	you can either use libsoup for http which integrates with the mainloop, or do threading yourself
Aug 08 06:08:15 <TingPing>	rudrab, here is an example of libsoup, https://github.com/TingPing/transmission-remote-gnome/blob/master/trg/client.py

Aug 08 06:18:10 <rudrab>	TingPing: so I don't need urllib at all. 
Aug 08 06:18:32 <TingPing>	libsoup would replace urllib, yes
Aug 08 06:19:03 <TingPing>	rudrab, did you get my example link?
Aug 08 06:19:09 <rudrab>	yes
Aug 08 08:16:31 <mclasen>	ebassi: around ?
Aug 08 08:17:57 <ebassi>	mclasen: Yes
Aug 08 08:18:10 <ebassi>	Got your emails
Aug 08 08:18:25 <mclasen>	would love ot hear your opinion on transforms
Aug 08 08:19:22 <ebassi>	I thought about it, this morning, and I think adding non-drawing nodes to deal with clip != allocation cases makes the most sense to me
Aug 08 08:20:20 <mclasen>	I get some 'texture doesn't exist' warning currently for non-drawing nodes
Aug 08 08:20:25 <ebassi>	Non-drawing nodes will be skipped when rendering, and each node has its own world coordinates matrix
Aug 08 08:20:32 <ebassi>	Mmh, that's a bug :-)
Aug 08 08:21:25 <mclasen>	in general, the conversions are surprisingly easy
Aug 08 08:22:50 <ebassi>	As for fallbacks, yes: dropping into a CairoRenderer should be a quick stop gap solution
Aug 08 08:23:05 <mclasen>	needs some new gsk api
Aug 08 08:23:34 <ebassi>	gsk_renderer_get_fallback() :-)
Aug 08 08:23:56 <mclasen>	also need a render() api that takes a cairo_t instead of a GdkDrawingContext
Aug 08 08:24:07 <mclasen>	or a way to create 'freestanding' drawing contexts
Aug 08 08:25:50 <mclasen>	the big outstanding conversions are scrolled window, notebook and stack - after those, most of gtk3-demo should turn into render nodes
Aug 08 08:26:54 <ebassi>	mclasen: Sounds good
Aug 08 08:27:13 <ebassi>	Then we can start porting leaf widgets like TextView and TreeView
Aug 08 08:27:38 <mclasen>	do you have a plan to fix the 'excessive invalidation' problem in widget-factory ?
Aug 08 08:27:53 <mclasen>	I couldn't really find a way to cache any textures or nodes across frames
Aug 08 08:28:57 <ebassi>	mclasen: Yeah, nodes should not be cached; ideally, like alex said on the mailing list, we should have a "surface cache" between GTK and GSK to keep rasterizations around between frames, and invalidate them only when the widget changes
Aug 08 08:29:10 <alex>	not only surfaces
Aug 08 08:29:16 <alex>	any buffers
Aug 08 08:29:28 <alex>	i.e. vertex buffers or whatever
Aug 08 08:30:03 <ebassi>	alex: Texture ids are cached across frames, if they have the same size; just the content is different
Aug 08 08:30:22 <ebassi>	I can also easily cache the VAOs if the quads are the same
Aug 08 08:30:28 <alex>	good
Aug 08 08:30:38 <ebassi>	The main issue is invalidations need to come from GTK
Aug 08 08:30:41 <alex>	yeah
Aug 08 08:30:52 <alex>	need new invalidation model for gtk
Aug 08 08:30:57 <alex>	(like in my mail)
Aug 08 08:31:15 <alex>	sorry for not replying to you btw
Aug 08 08:31:16 <mclasen>	ebassi: there's a bunch more conversions in my gsk-renderer branch, btw
Aug 08 08:31:19 <alex>	been offline mostly
Aug 08 08:31:25 <ebassi>	alex: No worries
Aug 08 08:31:46 <alex>	i'm hoping to be wowed at guadec though
Aug 08 08:31:47 <alex>	NO PRESSURE!
Aug 08 08:32:05 <ebassi>	heh
Aug 08 08:32:32 *	ebassi still has to write his talk, as usual
Aug 08 08:32:39 <alex>	do you do anything of css using custom shaders atm, or is it all texuturing from cairo drawn stuff?
Aug 08 08:33:06 <ebassi>	Nope, texturing; though there is the beginning of a CSS blend mode shader
Aug 08 08:33:24 <ebassi>	Untangling Cairo from GTK is going to take another cycle
Aug 08 08:33:47 <ebassi>	Too much stuff passes around a cairo_t, including the public API
Aug 08 08:34:12 <ebassi>	Gadgets already create different nodes for different bits — like border, background, and focus
Aug 08 08:36:17 *	mclasen was thinking of creating one node per css background
Aug 08 08:38:35 <alex>	ebassi: But will we not be creating assloads of textures?
Aug 08 08:39:10 <alex>	i.e. full size of widget surface/texture for everything that has a border
Aug 08 08:39:21 <alex>	or background
Aug 08 08:40:30 *	mclasen opens a color chooser and counts 124 textures
Aug 08 08:40:39 <alex>	at what sizes?
Aug 08 08:41:07 <mclasen>	most of them are for the individual color swatches, I think
Aug 08 08:41:19 <alex>	I mean, a 100x100 widget with a 1px black background and solid white bg, is that 2 100x100 textures?
Aug 08 08:41:51 <ebassi>	Currently, yes
Aug 08 08:41:58 <alex>	not ideal...
Aug 08 08:42:03 <ebassi>	We'd need a 9-slice texture node
Aug 08 08:42:10 <ebassi>	Or a border-specific node
Aug 08 08:42:26 <alex>	or 4 surfaces for the border
Aug 08 08:42:37 <alex>	+ wrapping 1x1 texture for solid bgs
Aug 08 08:42:48 <alex>	eh, repeating i mean
Aug 08 08:43:42 <ebassi>	To be fair, we don't have many solid colors
Aug 08 08:44:20 <ebassi>	Even borders have gradients :-/
Aug 08 08:44:52 <alex>	ebassi: Every toplevel has a solid bg, plus viewports
Aug 08 08:45:00 <alex>	ebassi: not a *lot* but often large
Aug 08 08:45:20 <mclasen>	do we plan on using gl for gradients ?
Aug 08 08:45:31 <mclasen>	as opposed to textures
Aug 08 08:45:45 <ebassi>	mclasen: AFAIR, Cairo has some code there, but it's pretty nasty
Aug 08 08:46:24 <ebassi>	For large textures I was thinking of adopting Cogl's sliced textures, but those make things like mipmapping much harder to achieve
Aug 08 08:46:25 *	mclasen would envision just sampling at a few points and letting gl do the interpolation as it sees fit
Aug 08 08:47:11 <ebassi>	mclasen: Should work mostly fine for small linear gradients, but it gets hairy for large/radial ones
Aug 08 08:47:28 <alex>	I think having a general textured fallback for things is fine
Aug 08 08:47:32 <mclasen>	right, radial won't work easily that way
Aug 08 08:48:08 <alex>	but for super common cases, like white bg for a textview bg, or the grey window bg, or a simple square black border 1/2px, we should do better
Aug 08 08:48:48 <ebassi>	alex: We could have a GskRenderNode.set_solid_color()
Aug 08 08:48:58 <alex>	yeah
Aug 08 08:49:02 <ebassi>	That would create a 1x1 texture with a repeat
Aug 08 08:49:15 <alex>	simple hack that probably helps bandwidth a lot
Aug 08 08:49:32 <alex>	as well as memory use
Aug 08 08:50:59 *	ChanServ sets mode +q on #gtk+ Company
Aug 08 08:50:59 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Company
Aug 08 08:51:20 <mclasen>	another question: whats the fate of the pixelcache with indirect rendering ?
Aug 08 08:51:36 <alex>	i also described that in my mail :)
Aug 08 08:52:02 <mclasen>	ah, great
Aug 08 08:52:18 <alex>	i.e. we want the system to do something similar but at the buffer level
Aug 08 08:52:23 <mclasen>	thats the 'gsk review' on -devel ?
Aug 08 08:52:35 <alex>	and track invalidation inside subwidgets
Aug 08 08:53:36 <alex>	https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2016-July/msg00002.html and follow up which i think never hit the list, but ebassis reply has most of it: https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2016-July/msg00024.html
Aug 08 09:00:41 <mclasen>	Company: any idea about this ? bug 769611
Aug 08 09:00:42 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769611 .General, normal, gtk-bugs, NEW , CSS text transitions are not smooth
Aug 08 09:02:29 <Company>	ugh
Aug 08 09:02:44 <Company>	* transitions transition everything, so I wouldn't even know what's going on there
Aug 08 09:03:06 <Company>	plus, i have no idea what happens when themes change
Aug 08 09:03:07 <mclasen>	but some of the text pretty clearly changes after the other stuff
Aug 08 09:04:09 <Company>	yeah, that probably shouldn't happen
Aug 08 09:04:27 <Company>	but from the test I have no idea why that's happening
Aug 08 09:05:01 <Company>	text is also changing color twice, which probably shouldn't happen either
Aug 08 09:05:39 <Company>	but I know stuff that looks like that can happen if opacity changes
Aug 08 09:06:34 <Company>	ie if you transition from white to transparent (which is transparent black), 50% means semi-transparent gray
Aug 08 09:07:28 <Company>	so it might in the end just be some bug about transitions in the parent widget causing transitions in the children to run (which they shouldn't but so far do)
Aug 08 09:07:51 <Company>	and the labels just being the ones where those are nested most deeply
Aug 08 09:08:28 <mclasen>	hmm
Aug 08 09:08:33 <Company>	because the label color transition runs after the button color transition runs after the box color transition runs after...
Aug 08 09:08:48 <mclasen>	shouldn
Aug 08 09:08:55 <mclasen>	t all transitions run at the same time ?
Aug 08 09:09:23 <Company>	a transition is started if a value changes
Aug 08 09:09:54 <mclasen>	and in this case some inherited value changes due to the 'parent transition' ?
Aug 08 09:10:02 <Company>	yes
Aug 08 09:10:15 <Company>	and we have color: inherit; transition: *
Aug 08 09:10:24 <mclasen>	but that would still make the child transition start as soon as the parent one gets ot changing values ?
Aug 08 09:10:33 <Company>	yes
Aug 08 09:10:38 <mclasen>	or does it continuously get restarted while the parent one runs ?
Aug 08 09:10:45 <Company>	and we'd start new ones all the time until the parent transition has finished
Aug 08 09:11:00 <mclasen>	thats...suboptimal
Aug 08 09:11:03 <mclasen>	does the spec require that ?
Aug 08 09:11:07 <Company>	no
Aug 08 09:11:28 <Company>	the specs require you to not start transitions if the change was caused by a transition
Aug 08 09:12:00 <Company>	but for that you need a framework that tracks why some value changed
Aug 08 09:12:27 <Company>	box-shadow: currentColor 1em 1em;
Aug 08 09:12:45 <Company>	that one shoudln't start transitions if the parent runs a transition for font-size or color
Aug 08 09:13:17 <Company>	so tracking that properly is hard
Aug 08 09:13:37 <Company>	and it's not been necessary because themes don't nest transitions
Aug 08 09:14:21 <Company>	ie we transition the button color, but not the color of it's label or the color of the box containing it
Aug 08 09:14:25 <Company>	so it works out in the end
Aug 08 09:14:47 <Company>	as long as you don't demo things in the inspector ;)
Aug 08 09:14:55 <mclasen>	I see
Aug 08 09:15:19 <Company>	it might of course be something else
Aug 08 09:15:54 <Company>	but we're not doing anything specific to fonts that I can think of in the CSS machinery
Aug 08 09:22:14 <iulianradu>	What are the steps to follow if I want to add some .svg files to an application?
Aug 08 09:22:43 <iulianradu>	I need to add them as gresources then use gtk_icon_theme_add_resource_path ()?
Aug 08 09:40:03 <bugbot>	New glib bug 769629 filed by msanchez@gnome.org.
Aug 08 09:40:03 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769629 general, normal, gtkdev, NEW , Re-enable libmount support by default
Aug 08 09:45:51 <Company>	iulianradu: you mean like https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/ThemedIcons ?
Aug 08 09:46:20 <mclasen>	ebassi: oh, one question I pondered: what do you envision child-transform to be useful for ? the problem with using it to go clip->allocation is that it applies equally to all child nodes (widget ones and css ones)
Aug 08 09:48:06 <ebassi>	mclasen: I added child-transform from ClutterActor; actors use it to do things like "scrollable actors". You set the child transform on the parent with the scrolling offset, and then children are all automatically transformed, instead of changing the transformations on each child
Aug 08 09:49:06 <mclasen>	does that imply that there's some parent-child clipping then ?
Aug 08 09:49:55 <ebassi>	mclasen: Ideally, yes, there should be; right now there isn't.
Aug 08 09:50:05 <ebassi>	So I guess I should remove it
Aug 08 09:50:07 <iulianradu>	Company: Thanks! It seems don't have to call add_resource_path () at all if I add them in the right directory. If I use something like gtk_image_set_from_icon_name () do I have to also add the extension to the name parameter (e.g. my-icon.svg or my-icon)? 
Aug 08 09:50:15 <ebassi>	And add a note on adding stencil-based clipping
Aug 08 09:51:17 <Company>	iulianradu: just my-icon - treat it like any other system icon
Aug 08 09:51:27 <iulianradu>	Thanks
Aug 08 09:52:48 <mclasen>	ebassi: and another question: who is reponsible for setting up a widget node's transform ? the code seems a bit confused about that, currently - the widget functions set transforms, and the propagate_render_node function overrides them
Aug 08 09:55:59 <bugbot>	New glib bug 769630 filed by damien.lespiau@gmail.com.
Aug 08 09:55:59 <bugbot>	Bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769630 gio, normal, gtkdev, NEW , gfile: G_FILE_MONITOR_WATCH_MOVES was actually introduced in 2.46
Aug 08 09:58:42 <ebassi>	mclasen: Yes, that's definitely suboptimal; ideally, the widget should do that, but now that the GtkContainer is allowed to override them it's a bit of a mess.
Aug 08 09:59:18 <ebassi>	mclasen: We have to solutions: one is to add a `gsk_render_node_get_transform()` and let the container modify the transform of the widget node
Aug 08 09:59:35 <ebassi>	mclasen: The other is to add a non-drawing node with the additional translation imposed by the container
Aug 08 10:02:04 <mclasen>	imo, the main thing we need is a definition of what get_render_node returns: does the node assume it is placed at the allocation, or at the clip
Aug 08 10:05:32 <mclasen>	this is somewhat related to clipping too: if we place the widget node at the allocation, we need to be able to add a larger node for the widget clip, without having the parent node clip it away
Aug 08 10:07:07 <ebassi>	mclasen: I would expect the parent node to be set to the clip, and then widget node to be set to the allocation
Aug 08 10:07:25 <ebassi>	[clip [allocation [children… ] ] ]
Aug 08 10:08:18 <fahrvergnugen>	I found a bug in the GIR; the second argument to g_regex_match_full is flagged as an array rather than a string, and I can't find any way to use it from lgi (Lua binding), even if I expand the string into an array of ASCII code points.
Aug 08 10:08:23 <mclasen>	that conflicts with what you said earlier (about having a non-drawing node at the allocation)...
Aug 08 10:09:09 <mclasen>	the 'widget node' in this terminology is what get_render_node returns, and what propagate_render_node places
Aug 08 10:10:17 <ebassi>	mclasen: Mmh, right
Aug 08 10:13:14 *	mclasen has to go do some trip preparation
Aug 08 10:13:29 <ebassi>	mclasen: Will think about it some more
Aug 08 10:14:28 <mclasen>	thanks
Aug 08 10:22:29 <garnacho>	fahrvergnugen: that's not too different from other places in API where string+length is given. Given there's no hitch in other languages (afaik), I'd think first that lgi is involved
Aug 08 10:22:42 <garnacho>	other places specify "element-type: guint8" though
Aug 08 10:24:03 <feborges>	after the changes in GtkScrolledWindow (bgo#766569), how should we approach scrolled windows which are unexpectedly expanding? by setting an arbitrary max-height-request?
Aug 08 10:25:41 <feborges>	for context: the g-c-c Printers panel is expanding because of the ScrolledWindow at the left listing the printers
Aug 08 10:25:43 <nacho_>	hey guys
Aug 08 10:26:23 <feborges>	http://i.imgur.com/345Gf5f.png
Aug 08 10:26:25 <nacho_>	for the gsettings macro how about having a gsettings_ENUM_PATH?
Aug 08 10:26:59 <nacho_>	so on non recursive makefiles I can provide a proper path for the generated file

Aug 08 10:43:44 <ebassi>	nacho_: I'd like to understand the issue, though
Aug 08 10:44:16 <ebassi>	nacho_: Why is it an issue if it's in the builddir?
Aug 08 10:45:04 <nacho_>	ebassi, in a non recursive makefile if I do NAMESPACE = pipo/my-namespace I want the generated enums.xml in pipo/ but I do not want pipo to be part of the namespace
Aug 08 10:45:08 <ebassi>	jjardon: Hey; last week I asked you if you remember why you had to add build-aux/config.rpath to the EXTRA_DIST
Aug 08 10:45:31 <jjardon>	ebassi: sorry, completely missed that; I was on holidays
Aug 08 10:45:38 <ebassi>	jjardon: No worries
Aug 08 10:45:45 <jjardon>	ebassi: its added automatically by gettextize
Aug 08 10:45:58 <ebassi>	jjardon: How?
Aug 08 10:46:19 <ebassi>	jjardon: You added it to Makefile.am/EXTRA_DIST
Aug 08 10:46:28 <ebassi>	It's a generated file, it should not be added to the dist
Aug 08 10:47:09 <jjardon>	ebassi: what module is this? gettextize modify the Makefile.am when you run it
Aug 08 10:47:19 <ebassi>	jjardon: gtk+

Aug 08 10:48:37 <ebassi>	If gettextize is adding config.rpath to the EXTRA_DIST then gettextize is doing something dumb
Aug 08 10:49:00 <jjardon>	ah, yeah; that was gettextize; should we submit a bug report?
Aug 08 10:49:07 <ebassi>	Yes, please
Aug 08 10:49:56 <jjardon>	I will send it to gettext when I finish work if you don't beat me on it :)
Aug 08 10:50:55 <ebassi>	I don't even know where the gettextize bug tracker is
Aug 08 10:52:07 <jjardon>	ebassi: AFAIK is a mailing list: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gettext/
Aug 08 10:52:20 <ebassi>	Yey!

Aug 08 11:21:27 <throwaway574>	3.14.15, Windows.  I'm more curious as to whether or not there is anything in GTK itself that can ignore the DPI settings in any version/environment.  Just knowing if it is possible in any context is what I'm looking for.
Aug 08 11:25:34 <pmike>	g_data_input_stream_readline is supposed to block or return NULL if there is no more data left in the receiving buffer?

Aug 08 11:29:53 <throwaway574>	that's okay.  i've been looking and i don't think there's anything either.
Aug 08 11:30:27 <pmike>	imo, i think there might be a bug there, at least when working with sockets (DataInputStreams) but would like to consult with you guys first
Aug 08 11:35:11 <aruiz>	throwaway574, I'd be curious to see a screenshot, can you file a bug?
Aug 08 11:35:53 <aruiz>	throwaway574, in any case, 3.14 is kind of dated atm...
