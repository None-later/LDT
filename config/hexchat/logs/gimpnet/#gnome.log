Dec 19 11:52:52 <lufimtse>	Hello, I'm trying to tie a hotkey (e.g F1) to run a bash script (e.g ~/home/user/path/myCmd.sh ). But adding a custom shortcut doesn't seem to work. Does anyone know how to get this to work? (Fedora 27/Wayland)
Dec 19 11:54:50 <borschty>	are you using ~ in the path? ~ is something that gets expanded by bash, but the custom commands are not launched by bash, so this won't get expanded
Dec 19 11:59:03 <peter-bittner>	> but why do you want to run gsettings on every login?
Dec 19 12:00:21 <peter-bittner>	I mainly need the script for the very first login (of LDAP users). But I do mount corporate NAS shares (with user permissions) on every login.
Dec 19 12:00:49 <lufimtse>	borschty, I've tried full path, doesn't see to work either? 
Dec 19 12:02:43 <borschty>	lufimtse, can you try restarting your session after changing the command? I remember some issue with the command not being updated immediately (not sure if this has been fixed yet)
Dec 19 12:03:16 <lufimtse>	borschty, 'r' doesn't work on wayland to restart anymore. Is logout & login enough to restart session or is there a better way?
Dec 19 12:03:19 <borschty>	peter-bittner, in that case custom dconf profiles with modified defaults seem like the way to go
Dec 19 12:03:41 <borschty>	lufimtse, logout & login
Dec 19 12:03:46 <lufimtse>	borschty, danke.
Dec 19 12:03:50 <lufimtse>	brb
