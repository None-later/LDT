Aug 31 10:58:15 <joanie>	alexarnaud: I'm in a meeting
Aug 31 10:58:27 <alexarnaud>	I've noticeed a syntax error on Orca.
Aug 31 10:58:39 <joanie>	alexarnaud: got a traceback?
Aug 31 10:58:50 <alexarnaud>	joanie: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23116287/
Aug 31 10:59:07 <joanie>	ok, will fix that. thanks

Aug 31 11:18:46 *	Now talking on #a11y
Aug 31 11:29:28 <joanie>	alexarnaud: so it seems like the issue is python3.4 -- or rather changes in python3.5 that I was using that are not in 3.4. In this particular case, the method in question was going to be removed anyway, so I've just made that change.
Aug 31 11:29:43 <joanie>	Any idea why Debian is not shipping python3.5?
Aug 31 11:32:53 <alexarnaud>	joanie: no idea, the next Debian will use python 4.5 for sure but the current stable has the 3.4.2.
Aug 31 11:33:44 <alexarnaud>	*python 3.5 sorry
Aug 31 11:33:53 *	joanie nods
Aug 31 11:34:01 <alexarnaud>	in the future Debian
Aug 31 12:02:27 <alexarnaud>	joanie: it works well :) ! Thank you very much.
Aug 31 12:02:55 <joanie>	alexarnaud: thanks for pointing it out. I obviously am not testing with older versions of Python.
Aug 31 12:19:56 <alexarnaud>	joanie: If I checked the box "speak object on the mouse" I cannot restart Orca because synthax error. You could find the log here : http://paste.ubuntu.com/23116689/
Aug 31 12:20:31 <joanie>	alexarnaud: looks like I need to bump the version of Gtk+
Aug 31 12:21:00 <joanie>	I'll add a sanity check shortly
Aug 31 12:21:53 <alexarnaud>	joanie: np, I just inform you :)
Aug 31 12:22:02 <joanie>	i appreciate it
Aug 31 12:33:42 <alexarnaud>	If you could take a look or forward me to right list or person about a technical question on AT-SPI2 (as I understand ATK standard) : https://mail.gnome.org/archives/orca-list/2016-August/msg00017.html
Aug 31 12:33:42 <alexarnaud>	I don't know if the question is clear, if not, I could contact ksamak to have precisions. For me his message is difficult to understand.
Aug 31 12:35:12 <joanie>	alexarnaud: I'm in another meeting but I just added a sanity check for your traceback. It won't make Mouse Review work, but it should (hopefully) stop Orca from spitting up.
Aug 31 12:36:12 <alexarnaud>	I'll check, thanks you so much.
