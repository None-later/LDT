Aug 31 10:58:15 <joanie>	alexarnaud: I'm in a meeting
Aug 31 10:58:27 <alexarnaud>	I've noticeed a syntax error on Orca.
Aug 31 10:58:39 <joanie>	alexarnaud: got a traceback?
Aug 31 10:58:50 <alexarnaud>	joanie: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23116287/
Aug 31 10:59:07 <joanie>	ok, will fix that. thanks

Aug 31 11:18:46 *	Now talking on #a11y
Aug 31 11:29:28 <joanie>	alexarnaud: so it seems like the issue is python3.4 -- or rather changes in python3.5 that I was using that are not in 3.4. In this particular case, the method in question was going to be removed anyway, so I've just made that change.
Aug 31 11:29:43 <joanie>	Any idea why Debian is not shipping python3.5?
Aug 31 11:32:53 <alexarnaud>	joanie: no idea, the next Debian will use python 4.5 for sure but the current stable has the 3.4.2.
Aug 31 11:33:44 <alexarnaud>	*python 3.5 sorry
Aug 31 11:33:53 *	joanie nods
Aug 31 11:34:01 <alexarnaud>	in the future Debian
Aug 31 12:02:27 <alexarnaud>	joanie: it works well :) ! Thank you very much.
Aug 31 12:02:55 <joanie>	alexarnaud: thanks for pointing it out. I obviously am not testing with older versions of Python.
Aug 31 12:19:56 <alexarnaud>	joanie: If I checked the box "speak object on the mouse" I cannot restart Orca because synthax error. You could find the log here : http://paste.ubuntu.com/23116689/
Aug 31 12:20:31 <joanie>	alexarnaud: looks like I need to bump the version of Gtk+
Aug 31 12:21:00 <joanie>	I'll add a sanity check shortly
Aug 31 12:21:53 <alexarnaud>	joanie: np, I just inform you :)
Aug 31 12:22:02 <joanie>	i appreciate it
Aug 31 12:33:42 <alexarnaud>	If you could take a look or forward me to right list or person about a technical question on AT-SPI2 (as I understand ATK standard) : https://mail.gnome.org/archives/orca-list/2016-August/msg00017.html
Aug 31 12:33:42 <alexarnaud>	I don't know if the question is clear, if not, I could contact ksamak to have precisions. For me his message is difficult to understand.
Aug 31 12:35:12 <joanie>	alexarnaud: I'm in another meeting but I just added a sanity check for your traceback. It won't make Mouse Review work, but it should (hopefully) stop Orca from spitting up.
Aug 31 12:36:12 <alexarnaud>	I'll check, thanks you so much.

Sep 12 10:38:33 <ankh>	schoppenhauer, in theory you could use an image inside svg, but in practice I don't know if that works very well. You could have a "longdesc" attribute on the image pointing to a script that sent the appropriate transcription, or you could generate the img element itself on the fly with a server-side include
Sep 12 10:38:52 <ankh>	on Linux at least you can try orca as a reader
Sep 12 10:39:06 <schoppenhauer>	i never got orca to work properly with firefox
Sep 12 10:39:39 <schoppenhauer>	i cannot generate the img-element on the fly when I want to host the file statically
Sep 12 10:40:38 <schoppenhauer>	hm. longdesc does not really solve this problem.
Sep 12 10:44:51 <schoppenhauer>	ankh: probably a VM with vinux is the easiest to get a working orca+ff, right?
Sep 12 10:45:53 <ankh>	no idea re. vinux
Sep 12 10:46:26 <ankh>	well, you're doing some scripting to generate the random image already
Sep 12 10:47:13 <ankh>	have that script generate <img alt="..." src="data:....." />
Sep 12 10:47:27 <ankh>	watch that you can't have paragraph breaks or other markup inside alt, though
Sep 12 10:48:46 <schoppenhauer>	well then I would have to generate the whole page containing the <img>
Sep 12 10:48:51 <schoppenhauer>	which I want to host statically
Sep 12 10:52:12 <ankh>	hmm, no, most web servers i think support server-side includes
Sep 12 10:52:29 <ankh>	e.g. in apache <!--#include....-->
Sep 12 10:52:41 <ankh>	or be sucky and use an iframe :)
Sep 12 10:53:13 <schoppenhauer>	I will probably use an iframe
Sep 12 10:53:23 <schoppenhauer>	but will screenreaders then read the contents of this iframe?
Sep 12 10:54:20 <schoppenhauer>	hm. i will see soon probably …
Sep 12 10:54:24 <schoppenhauer>	if vinux works.
Sep 12 11:09:31 <ankh>	they should, just as if you had used blocking javascript to fetch image and text, or to generate the image on a canvas
Sep 12 11:09:48 <ankh>	and added alternate text inside the canvas
Sep 12 11:26:44 <schoppenhauer>	ankh: how can I tell orca to read a website?
Sep 12 11:26:58 <schoppenhauer>	ankh: in the current vinux installation it does not even read alt-texts for some images
Sep 12 11:28:20 <ankh>	i'm not sure why, maybe try valdiating the page?
Sep 12 11:28:56 <schoppenhauer>	validating?
Sep 12 11:29:19 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: I don't have time for a deep dive, but how are you reading the page?
Sep 12 11:29:26 <joanie>	are you arrowing in the content?
Sep 12 11:29:57 <schoppenhauer>	I am trying
Sep 12 11:30:15 <joanie>	is it reading other things?
Sep 12 11:30:17 <schoppenhauer>	ah. I include the svg-images via <object>. and inside the object, I have a jpeg. and inside this jpeg, I have an alt-text
Sep 12 11:30:20 <schoppenhauer>	yes
Sep 12 11:30:22 <schoppenhauer>	it just ignores the image
Sep 12 11:30:41 <joanie>	I need to look at how object elements are exposed
Sep 12 11:30:45 <joanie>	my guess is ROLE_EMBEDDED
Sep 12 11:31:02 <joanie>	which makes it look like a web app (e.g. google sheets)
Sep 12 11:31:07 <schoppenhauer>	m(
Sep 12 11:31:15 <joanie>	and Orca is not supposed to allow navigation in that
Sep 12 11:31:21 <joanie>	says a spec
Sep 12 11:31:32 <schoppenhauer>	is there anything not broken with screenreaders?
Sep 12 11:32:06 *	joanie sighs at the question
Sep 12 11:34:56 <schoppenhauer>	can I disable object-tags then?
Sep 12 11:34:57 <joanie>	negativity aside, images with alt text are normally presented by Orca. I'll add looking into <object> as time permits. But it should work with the img element.
Sep 12 11:35:00 <joanie>	is that not an option?
Sep 12 11:35:16 <schoppenhauer>	no it is not
Sep 12 11:35:17 <joanie>	disable them?
Sep 12 11:35:41 <schoppenhauer>	svg should be included using object-tags, especially since this is the only way to have a fallback jpeg
Sep 12 11:35:49 <schoppenhauer>	and this jpeg is included using img
Sep 12 11:36:06 <joanie>	ok, then I'll look into the object issue. That's the best I can do right now
Sep 12 11:36:07 <joanie>	sorry
Sep 12 11:36:14 <schoppenhauer>	I assumed that when a screenreader cannot handle the object-tag, it would use the alternative content
Sep 12 11:36:36 <schoppenhauer>	because object-tags have alternative content for that purpose I think
Sep 12 11:36:47 <joanie>	the problem (what I need to address) is that the accessible object probably looks just like a web app
Sep 12 11:37:04 <joanie>	and the W3C spec says screen readers are supposed to not consume or cause navigation in web apps
Sep 12 11:37:21 <joanie>	so I need to pull tags out of object attributes to see that it's not a web app
Sep 12 11:37:34 <joanie>	and I apologize for not realizing this needed doing
Sep 12 11:37:41 <joanie>	i'll look at it shortly
Sep 12 11:37:47 <schoppenhauer>	ok
Sep 12 11:38:10 <joanie>	you have a test case handy?
Sep 12 11:38:25 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: https://blog.uxul.de/e?e=beekeeping
Sep 12 11:38:42 <joanie>	thanks. please give me a few as I didn't really have time for this
Sep 12 11:38:48 <schoppenhauer>	ok
Sep 12 11:38:52 <schoppenhauer>	take your time.
Sep 12 11:42:56 <schoppenhauer>	maybe in the meantime I'll try jaws on a vm
Sep 12 11:43:07 <joanie>	sounds like a plan
Sep 12 11:47:51 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: I was wrong about my theory. I'm looking at this in accerciser
Sep 12 11:48:00 <joanie>	The svg has ROLE_DOCUMENT_FRAME
Sep 12 11:48:08 <joanie>	and no alt text
Sep 12 11:48:25 <joanie>	because ROLE_DOCUMENT_FRAME is not ROLE_IMAGE
Sep 12 11:48:43 <joanie>	and the accessible name of the DOCUMENT_FRAME is the url of the svg
Sep 12 11:48:57 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: so … what can I do to make it accessible?
Sep 12 11:49:23 <joanie>	I would need to play around with it. Happily this time doesn't seem to be all screen readers being broken. That's something, anyway ;)
Sep 12 11:49:23 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: it is an <object ...><img ... alt="" /></object>
Sep 12 11:49:41 <joanie>	yeah, I see a bunch of child images which lack names
Sep 12 11:49:50 <joanie>	which result from the <img ... alt="">
Sep 12 11:50:03 <schoppenhauer>	it actually has alt-text
Sep 12 11:50:10 <joanie>	what does?
Sep 12 11:50:12 <schoppenhauer>	and I would have expected the alt-text to appear 
Sep 12 11:50:13 <joanie>	the svg?
Sep 12 11:50:16 <schoppenhauer>	no, the jpeg
Sep 12 11:50:19 <schoppenhauer>	inside the object-tag
Sep 12 11:50:29 <joanie>	I'm looking at this in accerciser
Sep 12 11:59:51 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: http://picpaste.com/what-alt-text-wBmYqIfi.png
Sep 12 11:59:58 <joanie>	that's a screenshot from Accerciser
Sep 12 12:00:05 <joanie>	that is what Orca sees
Sep 12 12:00:22 <joanie>	you'll note in that image that there's another image which does have an accessible name
Sep 12 12:00:27 <joanie>	the one about hipsters
Sep 12 12:00:43 <joanie>	you'll note that the svg element has the url as the accessible name
Sep 12 12:00:50 <joanie>	and a bunch of nameless child elements
Sep 12 12:01:11 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: that is the random image. does the internal frame have another child besides the svg?
Sep 12 12:01:32 <joanie>	lemme look
Sep 12 12:03:17 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: nope the internal frame has one child: the svg
Sep 12 12:03:48 <joanie>	and the svg has 162 nameless child images
Sep 12 12:05:48 <joanie>	and JAWS and NVDA are reading this??
Sep 12 12:13:43 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: Should I anticipate a new version to examine for accessibility?
Sep 12 12:17:54 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: anticipate?
Sep 12 12:18:14 <joanie>	I set aside some things to answer your questions and see if there was something I could fix in Orca
Sep 12 12:18:18 <schoppenhauer>	(jaws is not running yet)
Sep 12 12:18:24 <joanie>	if you're about to have a new version I'll wait
Sep 12 12:18:31 <joanie>	otherwise I'll go back to other stuff
Sep 12 12:19:01 <joanie>	but from what I see in Accerciser from this version, there's nothing on my side I can do
Sep 12 12:19:06 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: it has time, maybe first do other stuff and I'll find out what other screenreaders do
Sep 12 12:19:15 <joanie>	ok
Sep 12 12:19:29 <joanie>	I'd be curious as to what NVDA does as it gets the windows version of what I get
Sep 12 12:19:35 <joanie>	and I'm not getting anything I can work with
Sep 12 13:00:29 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: ok, jaws reads it
Sep 12 13:00:48 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: does NVDA?
Sep 12 13:01:02 <joanie>	JAWS might be parsing the content from the DOM
Sep 12 13:01:18 <joanie>	i.e. as opposed to using a11y apis
Sep 12 13:08:50 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: I just dusted off a windows 10 box I have for occasional testing. NVDA with Firefox seems to skip right over the image.
Sep 12 13:09:07 <schoppenhauer>	but why :(
Sep 12 13:09:17 <joanie>	remember that screenshot?
Sep 12 13:09:21 <schoppenhauer>	yes
Sep 12 13:09:26 <schoppenhauer>	but I don't understand that
Sep 12 13:09:29 <schoppenhauer>	it makes no sense
Sep 12 13:09:31 <joanie>	like I said earlier, NVDA gets essentially the same thing Orca gets
Sep 12 13:09:39 <joanie>	it's IA2 rather than ATK/AT-SPI2
Sep 12 13:09:51 <joanie>	but the accessibility tree and exposed info tends to be the same
Sep 12 13:10:01 <joanie>	so if NVDA cannot see it, Orca probably cannot either
Sep 12 13:10:21 <joanie>	JAWS, at least years ago, wasn't getting all it's info from the accessibility tree
Sep 12 13:10:46 <joanie>	I'm guessing perhaps it still does
Sep 12 13:11:08 <joanie>	getting back to your question: I don't know why Firefox is not exposing things to Orca and NVDA in the way you would like
Sep 12 13:11:18 <joanie>	but that would be a question for them
Sep 12 13:11:27 <schoppenhauer>	ok
Sep 12 13:11:37 <joanie>	if you go to irc.mozilla.org and join #accessibility
Sep 12 13:11:41 <schoppenhauer>	people should just use edbrowse.
Sep 12 13:11:43 <schoppenhauer>	ok
Sep 12 13:11:43 <joanie>	they might know the answer
Sep 12 13:11:48 <schoppenhauer>	thx, I'll ask them.
Sep 12 13:11:53 <schoppenhauer>	(not today, but probably tomorrow)
Sep 12 13:11:58 <joanie>	sorry I could n't just fix it for you
Sep 12 13:12:08 <joanie>	but I cannot turn nothing into something ;)
Sep 12 13:12:15 <joanie>	and what I'm getting is, I'm afraid, nothing
Sep 12 13:12:40 <joanie>	if you file a bug against gecko a11y, feel free to cc me

Sep 24 13:24:34 <joanie>	ankh: and djb: I just commented on the bug
Sep 24 13:25:17 <joanie>	I'll look into the numlock not toggling issue, but KP_Enter is doing the right thing (expected by users who are blind) if NumLock is off
Sep 24 13:28:27 <djb>	joanie: great thanks!
Sep 24 13:28:50 <djb>	after you said that i checked with gtk+, and indeed, if the numlock is off, then Enter does function as a way to retrigger the reading
Sep 24 13:29:38 <joanie>	djb: and this is all documented in the Orca docs
Sep 24 13:30:00 <joanie>	which, again, no one reads docs and that sucks if you're not a "typical" screen reader user
Sep 24 13:30:08 <djb>	mea culpa
Sep 24 13:30:10 <joanie>	but like I said in the bug, I don't see changing that
Sep 24 13:30:22 <joanie>	no, it's perfectly reasonable for you to not know that
Sep 24 13:30:31 <djb>	glad i found the oddity with gnome-shell though
Sep 24 13:30:51 <joanie>	scren reader users and developers and instructors know all the secret handshakes and knocks ;)
Sep 24 13:31:21 <joanie>	Orca has to hack around other known clutter input-event exposure (or failure to expose) issues
Sep 24 13:31:48 <joanie>	so my guess is that this is another not-Orca bug which Orca should hack around but isn't
Sep 24 13:32:02 <joanie>	or that Orca's hack is getting things wrong here :-/
Sep 24 13:32:10 <joanie>	this is why sad hacks are sad

Oct 10 12:20:38 <alexarnaud>	joanie: hey :) ! If you have some questions related to the Icedove bug report I'm available to answer.
Oct 10 12:21:09 <joanie>	alexarnaud: working on something else at the moment. But did you respond to my request for more specific steps?
Oct 10 12:21:43 <joanie>	ah icedove got it
Oct 10 12:21:55 <joanie>	email tends to be better for me than chat
Oct 10 12:22:04 <joanie>	but I'll take a look in icedove later
Oct 10 12:22:30 <alexarnaud>	joanie: It's difficult to give more specific steps. The only I can tell you is the Orca comportment on Icedove looks different than on Thunderbird, even if on the same machine.
Oct 10 12:23:08 <alexarnaud>	I suspect but I have no informations a little different things on the orca Icedove script.
Oct 10 12:23:54 <joanie>	ok. like I said, I'll take a look later. Since the bug report mentioned Thunderbird by name, I assumed we were talking about Thunderbird; didn't realize we were not.
Oct 10 12:24:00 <joanie>	Thanks for the clarification!

Oct 25 11:18:49 <freaky>	Hi, I'm experimenting around with text-to-speech for disabled people on fedora 24 currently. Anyone aware of good guides on how to get started?
Oct 25 11:19:19 <freaky>	Quite some stuff I'm running into, even when selecting flat text in says gedit it will occasionally output <selected> in the middle of texts
Oct 25 11:20:22 <freaky>	If one selects the text in reverse (from bottom to top) it gets even worse, first it will output the last couple of words, then the last sentence, then the last 2 sentences, etc., until it finally reads the full text (still with many "selected" exclamations in between)
Oct 25 11:21:51 <joanie>	freaky: if you are talking about Orca, which is a screen reader for users who are blind, it should say the word which is selected followed by "selected" so that people who cannot see the screen know what they are selecting.
Oct 25 11:22:27 <joanie>	the final thing you describe sounds like a bug. Lemme try.
Oct 25 11:22:44 <freaky>	Sure but if I select 5 sentences of text, with no markup in between, it shouldn't: select first couple of words, selected another couple of words, selected even more words selected, etc.
Oct 25 11:23:00 <joanie>	markup?
Oct 25 11:23:30 <joanie>	extremely concrete steps to reproduce?
Oct 25 11:23:52 <freaky>	There's no html, paragraphs, or whatever, just flat text with no enters in it. If there was markup it might be related to triggering the 'selected' speech multiple times, but there is none
Oct 25 11:24:08 <joanie>	What is the exact text and what keys are you pressing?
Oct 25 11:24:55 <freaky>	Have it with many texts, but in many things you'll have to select text for it to start speaking (unless I'm missing some hotkeys or something I should use, pretty new to this, not blind either :))
Oct 25 11:25:02 <freaky>	Last I used was this: De vrouw van Kanye West is dus niet de enige die hoopt dat de overvallers zo snel mogelijk worden opgepakt. Volgens politiechef Sainte staat zelfs de toekomst van Parijs op het spel. Volgens Vanity Fair heeft Parijs vorig jaar in de toeristische sector ongeveer een miljard dollar verloren aan de gevolgen van terroristische aanvallen. De stad kan zich een dergelijk verlies dus niet 
Oct 25 11:25:08 <freaky>	opnieuw permitteren. "Het is ontzettend belangrijk dat de daders worden gepakt, omdat iedereen zich afvraagt: is Parijs wel veilig?"
Oct 25 11:25:19 <freaky>	Just grabbed it from a news site
Oct 25 11:26:16 <freaky>	There's also a lot of difference between how apps work, for example, it will automatically speak the text in this console (using irssi), quite nicely, but if I select text here, it's not spoken
Oct 25 11:26:32 <joanie>	so I pasted your text in gedit
Oct 25 11:26:37 <joanie>	then I pressed control home
Oct 25 11:26:59 <joanie>	then I pressed shift+down arrow and orca read the line of text which was selected and ended by saying "selected"
Oct 25 11:27:20 <joanie>	I pressed shift+down arrow again and orca read the newly selected line of text and ended by saying "selected"
Oct 25 11:27:31 <joanie>	is this the behavior you are seeing or not?
Oct 25 11:27:31 <freaky>	Ah, I'm using a mouse haha, blind people probably won't do that
Oct 25 11:27:39 <joanie>	there you go
Oct 25 11:27:40 <joanie>	;)
Oct 25 11:27:52 <joanie>	I will try that and see if it's a bug in Orca
Oct 25 11:27:56 <freaky>	So the mouse events are probably triggering it then?
Oct 25 11:28:09 <joanie>	however, Orca is a screen reader for people who are blind. It's not a universal text-to-speech solution
Oct 25 11:28:31 <joanie>	and, yeah, as a general rule, physically using the mouse to select text is not something Orca users are doing
Oct 25 11:28:56 <freaky>	I know, we're looking into making a test facility for blind people. Not being blind kinda makes it difficult to erm place yourself in their world
Oct 25 11:29:01 <joanie>	so what problem are you trying to solve (i don't mean make orca do your bidding; I mean target users, etc.)
Oct 25 11:29:21 <joanie>	so your target users are blind?
Oct 25 11:30:03 <freaky>	The company I'm end produces a software solution for taking tests/exams. They want to add features to make it usable for blind and poor sighted, so we need to look into text-to-speech, magnifying, color profiles, etc.
Oct 25 11:30:19 <freaky>	end=at haha
Oct 25 11:30:34 <joanie>	ok
Oct 25 11:30:53 <freaky>	This seems rather dead too: https://wiki.gnome.org/Accessibility/Roadmap
Oct 25 11:31:12 <joanie>	yeah. there's only so much everyone has time for
Oct 25 11:31:19 <joanie>	I am the orca maintainer. I focus on that.
Oct 25 11:32:14 <joanie>	I did notice that when you do as you describe (namely use the mouse to select), Orca did present it in multiple chunks. I'll see why. My guess is multiple accessibility events.
Oct 25 11:32:23 <joanie>	HOWEVER, what I stated above holds
Oct 25 11:32:31 <joanie>	Orca is a screen reader.
Oct 25 11:32:59 <joanie>	if you want to test solutions for users who are sighted but have some other need for text-to-speech, then you'll want to look for other solutions 
Oct 25 11:33:09 <freaky>	Yea I understand, this is quite an experience. Much to find out, many different standards. Many apps doing things differently. Maybe I should visit some blind people and see how they do stuff
Oct 25 11:33:13 <joanie>	such as options for sighted users with learning disabilities
Oct 25 11:33:59 <joanie>	if you are tasked with setting up a center and working with individuals about whose needs you are completely unfamiliar, then.... Yeah, what you suggest makes a lot of sense ;)
Oct 25 11:35:03 <freaky>	Basically they want to use the software for a wide range of people including, by lack of a better word in my vocabulary, 'regular' people. Dead, blind, impaired (not fully disabled, not sure if it's the correct word), dyslectic and quite a few others. Main focus is blind and people that hardly see currently.
Oct 25 11:35:30 <joanie>	They can want all they'd like. :)
Oct 25 11:35:36 <joanie>	Orca will continue to be a screen reader
Oct 25 11:35:50 <joanie>	rather than a text-to-speech solution for all needs
Oct 25 11:37:15 <freaky>	Yea I understand. Might have to combine a lot of stuff or provide different paths eventually. The needs are quite different between them.
Oct 25 11:37:36 <joanie>	I fully agree about needs being quite different.
Oct 25 11:37:40 <joanie>	I'm glad you see that.
Oct 25 11:38:06 <joanie>	All too often people seem to assume the opposite
Oct 25 11:38:31 <joanie>	but there's no way to be a one-size-fits-all solution and still address the needs of users adequately
Oct 25 11:38:45 <joanie>	I know this from experience
Oct 25 11:40:18 <freaky>	Yea, probably is going to be quite a task to get something workable, even for just one category.
Oct 25 11:42:17 <freaky>	Thanks, I've got to run, closing up here. Will rejoin from screen session shortly. If you have good starting documentation I'd be much obliged.

Dec 07 11:24:17 <schoppenhauer>	hi. if I have some ascii-art and want to provide an alternative text for visually impaired people, is it the right thing to just add an aria-label-attribute with the description of the ascii art to the <pre />-element containing the art?
Dec 07 11:29:59 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: I'd have to look at a specific test case, however based on what you describe, the pre element with ascii contents is going to be exposed as a generic text object which implements the text interface. So perhaps adding role="img" to the pre element would help
Dec 07 11:30:26 <joanie>	if it claims to be an image, Orca is far less likely to do things like assume the text object with text should be treated like text
Dec 07 11:30:33 <joanie>	:)

Dec 12 09:31:47 <b4n>	wait, for some reason it works just fine it the entry doesn't actually has focus
Dec 12 09:32:00 <b4n>	so it should be "just" a matter of not focusing it on the desktop
Dec 12 10:20:43 <joanie>	b4n: the "for some reason" might be the fact that Orca needs to present the new location to the user. So if something claims focus, or something claims to be the active window, Orca believes the claim and presents it to the user.
Dec 12 10:21:09 <joanie>	So if the entry doesn't have (or claim to have) focus, Orca by default will not present it
Dec 12 10:21:15 <b4n>	yeah no, I get wht it makes orca do what I want
Dec 12 10:21:38 <b4n>	I was more surprised as it didn't break nothing further in the actual typeahead search
Dec 12 10:21:39 <joanie>	ah. Then I misread your statement
Dec 12 10:21:46 <joanie>	aha
Dec 12 10:21:50 <joanie>	gotcha. my bad.
Dec 12 10:22:12 <joanie>	so is this something you can fix on your end, and without it seeming like a sad hack?
Dec 12 10:22:29 <b4n>	well I can fix it on my end
Dec 12 10:22:39 <b4n>	but it somewhat still look like a sad hack
Dec 12 10:22:46 <joanie>	really?
Dec 12 10:23:04 <joanie>	the focused widget is usually something on screen
Dec 12 10:23:07 <b4n>	especially as apprently the focus was explicitely moved to the entry for the sake of input methods
Dec 12 10:23:42 <b4n>	yeah as it's actually not visible (pushed outside of the screen on the bottom right), maybe it's not worse than right now, and does what "I" want
Dec 12 10:24:31 <b4n>	anyway, for now I'm happy, and don't need a way to fool orca, so that's nice
Dec 12 10:24:41 <joanie>	(I'm just trying to make the case for why it's not a sad hack :-) )
Dec 12 10:24:53 <joanie>	not fooling/tricking Orca is good too :)
Dec 12 10:25:12 <b4n>	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66466
Dec 12 10:25:15 <joanie>	not asking Orca to lie to users about what has focus is also good ;)
Dec 12 10:26:19 <b4n>	well, in this very case what actually has focus is slightly tricky, as both widgets are coupled so tightly they basically share events
Dec 12 10:26:27 <b4n>	that very think is kind of a hack to start with
Dec 12 10:26:32 <b4n>	thing*

Dec 12 21:39:44 <TheMuso>	texou: One difference on Windows is that when you perform a type ahead, it doesn't bring up a text entry, it just jumps to the first matching item with the text you type, although I think that only works when you type the beginning of the item in question.
Dec 12 21:39:58 <TheMuso>	texou: Mate and Nautilus have always popped up a text field of some kind when type ahead search is being done.
Dec 12 21:40:07 <TheMuso>	Frankly I think Windows' behavior is better.
Dec 12 21:40:17 <TheMuso>	Mac OS also does the same as Windows.
Dec 13 03:54:56 <b4n>	joanie: hi
Dec 13 03:55:42 <b4n>	as the solution I found is likely to generate problems with IM methods, I'll continue searching whether it's possible to limit the changes to the AT layer
Dec 13 03:56:39 <joanie>	b4n: ok
Dec 13 03:56:40 <b4n>	I'll be trying STATE_INVALID, but that'll take a little longer than I expected as apparently one can't simply set a role on an ATK object, but has to override ref_state_set()
Dec 13 03:57:12 <joanie>	right
Dec 13 03:57:14 <b4n>	in the meantime I was mondering if it was easy to add some kind of filters over what Orca sees?  it would be easy to tag the offending window
Dec 13 03:58:03 <b4n>	(BTW, I talked with 3 people about what should happen from their user POV, and they agree the text field is not very useful info and leads to highly annoying feedback)
Dec 13 03:58:24 <joanie>	always or just on the desktop?
Dec 13 03:58:45 <b4n>	always for that typeahead search window
Dec 13 03:58:51 <joanie>	interesting
Dec 13 03:59:36 <joanie>	I suspect that if I ignored it -- and identifying it reliably might itself be challenging -- someone would call it a bug because it gets focus and impacts what keyboard navigation works
Dec 13 04:00:35 <joanie>	is there some setting through which typeahead could be disabled?
Dec 13 04:00:38 <b4n>	Caja could help for identifying it I guess
Dec 13 04:00:49 <b4n>	no, not that I know of
Dec 13 04:01:26 <b4n>	hum yeah actually it can, but only my application choice AFAIK
Dec 13 04:02:07 <joanie>	if you added the option to disable it in caja, and Orca users disabled it, would that help?
Dec 13 04:02:30 <joanie>	anyhoo, right now I'm working on some other things, but I'll add this to my todo list.
Dec 13 04:03:21 <b4n>	the thing is that they like the typeahead feature (somehow, maybe it doesn't exactly behave as they like best)
Dec 13 04:03:48 <b4n>	it could be an option to introduce my change that might break input methods, but that seems an option for trading one problem for another
Dec 13 04:03:54 <b4n>	joanie: okay, thanks
Dec 13 04:04:56 <b4n>	I'll try the STATE_INVALID thing in the meantime
Dec 13 05:34:42 <joanie>	b4n: I am still working on something else, but that something else caused me to think of another hack that might work: Assign it ATK_ROLE_UNKNOWN.
Dec 13 05:35:01 <joanie>	If you don't know what it is, Orca can't know what it is, and by default tends to ignore such objects.
Dec 13 05:35:09 <b4n>	STATE_INVALID on the window didn't work BTW
Dec 13 05:35:15 <b4n>	okay
Dec 13 05:36:11 <b4n>	BTW, the entry actually has focus only for a very short time, so 99% of the time it's still the GtkTreeView that has it
Dec 13 05:36:31 <b4n>	so it really doesn't seem to be so useful to annouce it as it gies awai the next second
Dec 13 05:36:55 <joanie>	sure. But the problem is being able to reliably identify that condition.
Dec 13 05:36:57 <b4n>	yes, that code seem riddled with hacks :)
Dec 13 05:37:02 <b4n>	yeah
Dec 13 05:37:05 <joanie>	which code?
Dec 13 05:37:28 <b4n>	GtkTreeView and Caja's icon view interactive search
Dec 13 05:37:54 <joanie>	ah. (Orca's code is too, but it's due to things like we're discussing)
Dec 13 05:38:14 <b4n>	(:S)
Dec 13 05:38:28 *	joanie shrugs
Dec 13 05:38:39 <joanie>	ping me after you try the ROLE_UNKNOWN hack
Dec 13 05:38:39 <b4n>	well, hence why ideally I'd rather like a way to make Caja do what's needed not to have to touch Orca
Dec 13 05:38:45 <b4n>	okay
Dec 13 05:38:52 <b4n>	on the window, the entry or both?
Dec 13 05:39:06 <joanie>	start with the entry
Dec 13 05:39:28 <b4n>	okay, thanks
Dec 13 05:39:32 <joanie>	if that doesn't do it, I may need to add a sanity check, but that wouldn't be a hack imho
Dec 13 05:43:59 <b4n>	okay, setting ROLE_UNKNOWN makes Orca not announce the text field, but it still re-announces the icon view
Dec 13 05:44:24 <b4n>	I guess it makes sense as it still sees focus in to that view
Dec 13 05:44:41 *	joanie nods
Dec 13 05:45:13 <b4n>	lemme test STATE_INVALID + ROLE_UNKNOWN, although I'm pessimistic
Dec 13 05:45:22 <joanie>	that's not it
Dec 13 05:45:33 <joanie>	it's the focus claim (re-claiim) if I had to guess
Dec 13 05:45:40 <joanie>	you using Orca master?
Dec 13 05:45:57 <b4n>	no
Dec 13 05:46:05 <joanie>	what version?
Dec 13 05:46:08 <joanie>	(orca -v)
Dec 13 05:46:09 <b4n>	(and yes, it's highly likely the focus back and forth)
Dec 13 05:46:17 <b4n>	but I can try on it
Dec 13 05:46:30 <joanie>	well, here's what I'm thinking:
Dec 13 05:46:36 <joanie>	and master won't fix it
Dec 13 05:46:41 <b4n>	joanie: you bucled up?  3.16.2
Dec 13 05:46:47 <joanie>	zomg
Dec 13 05:46:54 <joanie>	all bets are off
Dec 13 05:47:11 <b4n>	I can switch to master and see what happens
Dec 13 05:47:19 <joanie>	so I don't think master will fix it, BUT
Dec 13 05:47:27 <joanie>	you can then capture a debug.out for me
Dec 13 05:47:34 <joanie>	having made your ROLE_UNKNOWN change
Dec 13 05:47:53 <joanie>	and I can use that output to figure out what Orca is ignoring, reacting to, presenting, etc.
Dec 13 05:48:00 <b4n>	and I need master for that?
Dec 13 05:48:15 <joanie>	you need a quite recent version for a couple of reasons:
Dec 13 05:48:23 <joanie>	1) Orca spews a lot more output now
Dec 13 05:48:23 <b4n>	(I got 3.22.2 on my dev machine)
Dec 13 05:48:31 <joanie>	3.22.2 is good
Dec 13 05:49:13 <joanie>	If I make any changes in Orca for this, you'll need master (or to patch your 3.22.2 version)
Dec 13 05:49:24 <b4n>	yeah sure
Dec 13 05:49:40 <b4n>	<evil>or backport on 3.16? :D
Dec 13 05:49:43 <joanie>	but quite a bit has changed since 3.16.2
Dec 13 05:49:54 <joanie>	dude, that's a whole different Orca
Dec 13 05:50:02 <joanie>	feel free though
Dec 13 05:50:14 <joanie>	Free Software is Free :)
Dec 13 05:51:01 <b4n>	as in free to inflicate myself as much pain as I want trying to backport, got it :)
Dec 13 05:51:13 <joanie>	You learn quickly ;)
Dec 13 05:51:34 <b4n>	I ain't new to free software :)
Dec 13 05:51:48 <b4n>	(to think about backporting stuff, a lot more)
Dec 13 05:52:13 <joanie>	patch might apply, or be easy to adjust, but whether or not there are other changes that the fix would assume that you would lack... dunno.
Dec 13 09:19:58 <b4n>	joanie: did you inspect the mess happening with the focus without ROLE_UNKNOWN?
Dec 13 09:23:57 <joanie>	b4n: the mess?
Dec 13 09:24:04 <joanie>	and did you send me a full debug.out?
Dec 13 09:24:31 <b4n>	sorry, I responded to the orca ML post, but I wasn't subscribed so it's moderated
Dec 13 09:24:47 <b4n>	not yet, I did fight my Caja build, but it's alright now
Dec 13 09:25:10 <b4n>	joanie: with and without the ROLE_UNKNOWN, or only with?
Dec 13 09:25:21 <joanie>	with
Dec 13 09:27:04 <b4n>	even without you'll see that on the first key press orca will "say" focus to the text, to the view and back to the text upon the first key press, and back to the view upon the second one -- and no focus change after that
Dec 13 09:27:24 <joanie>	b4n: btw, I don't need the speech
Dec 13 09:27:28 <joanie>	I need the debug.out
Dec 13 09:27:42 <joanie>	with the role unknown
Dec 13 09:27:54 <b4n>	ok :)
Dec 13 09:28:04 <joanie>	and with at least 3.22.x

Dec 13 10:16:00 *	Now talking on #a11y
Dec 13 10:18:13 <joanie>	b4n: in my environment, I have gtk+3. Is that what your version is using as well?
Dec 13 10:18:36 <b4n>	yeah
Dec 13 10:19:12 <b4n>	earlier this morning I was on GTK2 with Orca 3.16, but now it's GTK3
Dec 13 10:19:21 <b4n>	behavior is virtually the same
Dec 13 11:11:48 <b4n>	okay a working hack is to remove the ATK_STATE_FOCUSED from the entry :)
Dec 13 11:12:14 <joanie>	cool
Dec 13 11:12:27 <joanie>	I'm still trying to detect these things
Dec 13 11:12:35 <joanie>	I don't think we want to be completely silent
Dec 13 11:12:47 <b4n>	yeah maybe not
Dec 13 11:12:52 <joanie>	but prune down the spoken spewage
Dec 13 11:13:11 <joanie>	btw, don't do the unknown hack. I need the role to detect the widget
Dec 13 11:13:24 <b4n>	BTW, I noticed that the popup has no parent -- not that it changes anything for the matter at hand though
Dec 13 11:13:35 <b4n>	ok
Dec 13 11:59:15 <joanie>	b4n: working on this I was reminded of a silly issue in caja that I think I reported and which is still present (in stable).
Dec 13 11:59:29 <joanie>	could you please see if it's fixed, and if not, fix it?
Dec 13 11:59:48 <joanie>	in particular, open a caja window in the icon view
Dec 13 11:59:58 <joanie>	locate one of the icons in accerciser
Dec 13 12:00:16 <joanie>	and in accerciser's ipython console, with that caja icon selected, type:
Dec 13 12:00:24 <joanie>	acc.queryText().getText(0,-1)
Dec 13 12:01:23 <joanie>	icons really shouldn't implement the accessible text interface
Dec 13 12:30:36 <joanie>	b4n: I just committed some changes to Orca master for Gtk+ 3 which hopefully will make Caja suck less w.r.t. typeahead
Dec 13 12:31:11 <b4n>	wow
Dec 13 12:31:14 <b4n>	thanks
Dec 13 12:31:44 <joanie>	sure thing. Please fix the bogus text thing I mentioned above
Dec 13 12:32:01 <joanie>	I added a hack for that too
Dec 13 12:34:44 <b4n>	joanie: hum, lemme see for that accerciser thing
Dec 13 12:35:48 <joanie>	b4n: what you'll notice if you poke around further in accerciser is that the accessible description, accessible name, and accessible image description all contain the details
Dec 13 12:36:10 <joanie>	concatenating it all together -- let alone failing to include a space -- is not desired
Dec 13 12:36:13 <joanie>	nor necessary
Dec 13 12:36:35 <joanie>	and, again, icons should not implement accessible text anyway ;)
Dec 13 12:39:39 <b4n>	okay, ipithon console plugin is broken here…
Dec 13 12:39:47 <b4n>	"AttributeError: 'InteractiveShellEmbed' object has no attribute 'readline_startup_hook'"
Dec 13 12:40:31 <b4n>	but the interface browser suggests it doesn't implement text
Dec 13 12:40:31 <joanie>	bah
Dec 13 12:40:40 <joanie>	that's the thing, I see that too
Dec 13 12:40:59 <joanie>	but if you use the working ipython console to query the text interface
Dec 13 12:41:01 <joanie>	it works
Dec 13 12:41:12 <joanie>	and you get the text as I described it
Dec 13 12:41:27 <joanie>	and it's bad and wrong and must be stopped ;)
Dec 13 12:42:04 <b4n>	it provides the info some other non-crazy way?
Dec 13 12:42:15 <joanie>	don't follow you
Dec 13 12:42:40 <joanie>	but the needed info is correctly exposed via object properties (name and description) and via image interface (description)
Dec 13 12:42:53 <b4n>	okay, so that answers me
Dec 13 12:42:58 <joanie>	:)
Dec 13 12:47:31 <b4n>	yeah aparently it uses gail_text_util stufs "editable text" and "additional text" in it
Dec 13 12:47:41 <b4n>	not sure what it does, but that sounds like what you say
Dec 13 12:47:53 <joanie>	ah
Dec 13 12:48:18 <joanie>	so editable text being implemented makes sense if, duh, it's being edited.
Dec 13 12:48:38 <joanie>	not sure then if it would be better to only implement text in that case
Dec 13 12:48:54 <joanie>	or just leave my Orca hack in place
Dec 13 12:49:13 <joanie>	but regardless, stuffing should include spaces to separate what is being stuffed
Dec 13 12:49:26 <b4n>	makes sense indeed
Dec 13 12:49:59 <joanie>	please and thank you
Dec 13 12:50:01 <joanie>	:)
Dec 13 12:50:34 <b4n>	I don't really know what I would be changing, but sure adding a space would be easy, I can do that and try and submit it :)
Dec 13 12:50:55 <joanie>	perfect
Dec 13 12:56:19 <b4n>	joanie: hum, I'm not sure what your changes fo rtypeahead to "suck less" do?
Dec 13 12:56:36 <joanie>	filter out spam mostly
Dec 13 12:56:48 <joanie>	lots less chattiness
Dec 13 12:57:12 <b4n>	oh, I see the navigation in the entry now has feedback
Dec 13 12:57:14 <joanie>	are you not seeing a reduction in chattiness?
Dec 13 12:57:47 <joanie>	e.g. on the desktop
Dec 13 12:58:00 <joanie>	which is what started this whole two-day-long adventure
Dec 13 12:58:01 <joanie>	;)
Dec 13 12:58:11 <b4n>	yeah actually I am, that sounds pretty great :)
Dec 13 12:58:36 <joanie>	good
Dec 13 12:59:09 <b4n>	thanks!
Dec 13 12:59:16 <joanie>	so hopefully that addresses the issue. I'll deal with Gtk+ 2 later. I've set aside some things which I need to return to now.
Dec 13 12:59:27 <joanie>	(and by "now" I mean hours ago)
Dec 13 13:00:02 <b4n>	sorry for sidetracking you, and thanks a lot for the attention, help and fix :)
Dec 13 22:23:23 <nicolas17>	hi
Dec 13 22:23:44 <nicolas17>	does AT-SPI have any interface for tree widgets, like in a directory hierarchy in a file browser?
Dec 13 22:31:26 <nicolas17>	ugh... I think I know what's going on
Dec 13 22:31:36 <nicolas17>	Qt bug with trees
Dec 13 22:33:14 <nicolas17>	or missing features
Dec 14 04:18:09 <b4n>	joanie: https://github.com/mate-desktop/caja/pull/692 should do for the icon stuffing hopefully
Dec 14 04:18:50 <joanie>	b4n: excellent. Thanks!
Dec 14 04:18:58 <b4n>	np
Dec 14 04:44:12 <b4n>	hum, the typeahead hack in orca seems to sometimes stop working
Dec 14 04:44:28 <b4n>	unfortunately I can't identify when for the moment
Dec 14 04:45:17 <joanie>	b4n: ok. I cannot deal with it now. Have an important all-hands meeting to prepare for. If you come up with reliable, concrete steps, please email them to me and I'll try to look later (possibly not until next week, however).
Dec 14 04:45:36 <b4n>	ok, no worries
Dec 19 04:25:35 <b4n>	joanie: https://github.com/mate-desktop/caja/pull/692 do you have an easy way to see how that's useful?  I actually can't seem to find a situation where both those things are set (or either even?)
Dec 19 04:26:06 <b4n>	and the guys legitimately ask for hwo to reproduce :)
Dec 19 04:26:47 <joanie>	b4n: I'll comment
Dec 19 04:26:53 <b4n>	thanks
Dec 19 04:29:48 <joanie>	b4n: did you ever get a working accerciser
Dec 19 04:29:49 <joanie>	?
Dec 19 04:30:17 <b4n>	yeah if I downgrade a lib it works
Dec 19 04:30:35 <joanie>	so could you do a screenshot using the ipython console before and after?
Dec 19 04:30:53 <b4n>	sure
Dec 19 04:30:54 <b4n>	2s
Dec 19 04:31:10 <joanie>	since I'm officially on vacation, but working on other things, if you could do that and attach that to the issue, it would be helpful
Dec 19 04:34:52 <b4n>	joanie: okay, so what should I do in accerciser?
Dec 19 04:35:01 <b4n>	i've got an unpatched version to start with
Dec 19 04:35:10 <joanie>	what I stated the other day, namely:
Dec 19 04:35:20 <joanie>	select one of the icons in the pane on the left
Dec 19 04:35:26 <joanie>	then go into the ipython console
Dec 19 04:35:35 <joanie>	and type acc.queryText().getText(0,-1)
Dec 19 04:36:00 <joanie>	without your patch, the size should be crammed up together with the other information
Dec 19 04:36:10 <joanie>	with your patch, there should be a space before the size
Dec 19 04:38:05 <b4n>	hum, I don't see the size in that description
Dec 19 04:38:15 <b4n>	just the plain label
Dec 19 04:40:07 <joanie>	you may need to change your configuration
Dec 19 04:40:14 <joanie>	lemme get a screenshot
Dec 19 04:40:48 <b4n>	that's in icon view, right?
Dec 19 04:41:03 <joanie>	b4n: yes
Dec 19 04:41:10 <joanie>	is the size displayed on screen?
Dec 19 04:41:29 <b4n>	no
Dec 19 04:41:43 <joanie>	display it
Dec 19 04:41:50 <joanie>	what's being crammed together is the displayed text
Dec 19 04:43:30 <b4n>	okay, that optio nis broken, but I got them to display.  now Accerciser is stuck :)
Dec 19 04:44:48 <joanie>	i just discovered you can get even more noise by zooming
Dec 19 04:44:58 <joanie>	lemme see if I can get a "this is so broken" screenshot
Dec 19 04:45:21 <b4n>	okay, I got the stuffed thing
Dec 19 04:45:39 <joanie>	zoom way in so that there are like 4 lines
Dec 19 04:45:57 <joanie>	with the size, being a number, you won't necessarily hear that in speech
Dec 19 04:46:26 <joanie>	because you cannot really pronounce letters joined with digits as anything other than separate words
Dec 19 04:46:38 <b4n>	yeah
Dec 19 04:46:43 <b4n>	I'll screenshot that
Dec 19 04:47:01 <joanie>	yay!
Dec 19 04:47:23 <joanie>	at 400% it's chocked full of crap
Dec 19 04:48:52 <joanie>	hmmm. doesn't seem to be cramming anything more than the size
Dec 19 04:48:57 <joanie>	(which is still broken)
Dec 19 05:30:00 <b4n>	okay, Caja decided to annoy me just now, but I commented

Dec 21 04:35:51 <b4n>	joanie: hi!  how would you feel about a patch like that https://gist.github.com/cwendling/58adf3cc8a4665fe51e5409f96b5821c ?
Dec 21 04:36:27 <b4n>	FWIW landegav` tells me he's very happy with the result
Dec 21 04:37:07 <b4n>	I'm absolutely not sure about the implementation here, but the idea would be just ignoring the events to the typeahead search entry
Dec 21 04:38:15 <b4n>	I've got the little sister of that patch for GTK3 too, but it removes some of your previous work on that area (as it again just ignores the typeahead instead of trying and be clever about it)
Dec 21 04:40:28 <landegave>	I confirm that I'm satisfied. All of our users are disturbed by the verbose on the desktop. The aim is to find fastly an icon.
Dec 21 04:46:34 <joanie>	b4n: I'll look later. But ignoring all events sounds like a bad idea.
Dec 21 04:47:02 <joanie>	but since hypra has it's own distro you can maintain that solution in your version of Orca.
Dec 21 04:48:14 <joanie>	s/it's/its/
Dec 21 04:49:06 <b4n>	yeah I figured you'd say that about ignoring the events :)  I let landegave argue about why he feels presenting the text field is also noise
Dec 21 04:49:48 <b4n>	and yeah we can probably patch on our end, but it's better if we can come up with a solution everyone is happy about that everyone can have
Dec 21 04:49:52 <b4n>	easily that is
Dec 21 04:50:07 <joanie>	sure
Dec 21 04:50:22 <joanie>	but if I thought ignoring all events was a good idea, I would have ignored all events
Dec 21 04:50:42 <b4n>	of course
Dec 21 04:50:49 <b4n>	(and would have been easier too I uess)
Dec 21 04:50:52 <b4n>	guess*
Dec 22 08:04:02 <b4n>	joanie: hum, after discussing further internally, how would feel about fixing it your way, but whether or not announcing the text field itelf depending on the verbosity setting?
Dec 22 08:05:15 <alexarnaud>	or maybe with an orca option for  caja
Dec 22 09:05:49 <landegav`>	Does anyone know if it's possible to specify a speech-dispatcher port in Orca?

Jan 20 06:58:28 <alexarnaud>	joanie: Hello :) ! Do you prefer I report bugs on the bugzilla? Do you have seen the three bug I have reported about Icedove (maybe also Thunderbird)? I really think it's important issue that it would be really cool to fix them before the 3.24 release.
Jan 20 07:36:28 <joanie>	alexarnaud: I saw the emails. Those are sufficient. But I don't use icedove and would always like a debug.out for those sorts of matters anyway. I've since responded to your emails. Apologies for not doing so yesterday, but I wanted to finish the landmark-related context work.
Jan 20 07:37:06 <joanie>	Lastly, I am preparing for overseas travel today. I will look as soon as possible to the output you provide. TTYL.
Jan 20 07:38:10 <alexarnaud>	joanie: No problem. I'm not totally sure but it could be really possible that the issue I have reported are the same on Thunderbird.
Jan 20 07:38:46 <alexarnaud>	thanks a lot for the great work you provide :) !
Jan 20 07:39:09 <alexarnaud>	I love the new feature about the announcement of list, quote etc :).
Jan 20 07:42:32 <joanie>	alexarnaud: It would be helpful if you could see if they are the same on Thunderbird.
Jan 20 07:43:03 <joanie>	And I'm glad you like the new feature. :)
Jan 20 07:43:27 <joanie>	There shall be more (like the font and formatting stuff for proofreading)
Jan 20 07:43:54 <joanie>	Hopefully within a couple of weeks. Though it depends on other stuff on my plate and deadlines and the like.
Jan 20 07:43:59 <alexarnaud>	joanie: why the mouse review feature requires GTK 3.20?
Jan 20 07:44:31 <joanie>	because fixing some bugs was accomplished by taking advantage of some stuff in Gdk
Jan 20 07:45:02 <joanie>	And officially Orca 3.x is supported only in GNOME 3.x
Jan 20 07:45:14 <joanie>	I do my best to keep things backwards compatible
Jan 20 07:45:36 <joanie>	but I cannot maintain lots of different versions of Orca
Jan 20 07:45:43 <alexarnaud>	OK, I'll try to test with Thunderbird. I will especially in the future try to make Icedove replaced by Thunderbird into Debian like it is the case for Firefox.
Jan 20 07:46:02 <joanie>	and to be honest, when I fixed the mouse review stuff, I discovered it was so broken that clearly no one was using it at all
Jan 20 07:46:34 <joanie>	so I didn't feel especially guilty for requiring a version of GTK that was recent -- but not even current at that time.
Jan 20 07:47:01 <joanie>	People who MUST have mouse review should consider upgrading to a more current version of GNOME ;)
Jan 20 07:47:12 <alexarnaud>	joanie: The only reason why no people use this feature as we see in Hypra is because it is as usable as in NVDA.
Jan 20 07:47:36 <joanie>	I don't get what you just said
Jan 20 07:48:40 <alexarnaud>	joanie: GNOME is not the best a11y environment for the low-vision people. Compiz are more powerful than the built-in GNOME Magnifier.
Jan 20 07:49:19 <joanie>	ok, lemme rephrase. A current GNOME or MATE environment
Jan 20 07:49:34 <joanie>	assuming the distros are using GTK 3.0
Jan 20 07:49:39 <alexarnaud>	joanie: I really want to help you to fix mouse review stuff but I'm using Debian 8.7 so GTK 3.14.
Jan 20 07:49:43 <joanie>	for instance Fedora 25 MATE spin would work
Jan 20 07:49:59 <joanie>	alexarnaud: the mouse review stuff is, I believe, fixed
Jan 20 07:50:14 <joanie>	have you tried it with GTK 3.20 or later?
Jan 20 07:51:12 <alexarnaud>	joanie: unfortunately I've not try it on modern platform.
Jan 20 07:51:31 <joanie>	Ok. If you try it on a modern platform and find it is broken, please let me know.
Jan 20 07:51:51 <alexarnaud>	OK :), thanks so much !!!!
Jan 20 07:52:14 <joanie>	OK, really walking away from my computer now. I'm not good at not working. ;)
Jan 20 07:52:30 <joanie>	Talk to you next week (probably via email), ok?
Jan 20 07:52:56 <alexarnaud>	joanie: Yeah, It will be a really pleasure as usual.
Jan 20 07:53:16 <alexarnaud>	joanie: As you could see b4n works a lot to fix mate a11y stuff.
Jan 20 07:54:26 <alexarnaud>	joanie: We need your help or the help of an experienced man to understand difficult thinks like he have posted on g-a-devel.list.
Jan 20 07:54:58 <alexarnaud>	Have a good travel and see you soon on the network world :).
Jan 20 15:20:14 <alexarnaud>	texou: ?
Jan 20 15:20:34 <texou>	alexarnaud: ?
Jan 20 16:04:10 <schoppenhauer>	hello
Jan 20 16:12:08 <schoppenhauer>	if anyone finds the time, can he please look at the text https://uxul.de/~schoppenhauer/brlswitch.xhtml with a braille reader? it is a pixelated comic of mine, and I wanted to know how well it is recognizable
Jan 20 16:12:24 <schoppenhauer>	it consists of unicode braille characters (so you need a screen reader that can handle it)
Jan 20 17:55:51 <schoppenhauer>	anyone?
Jan 20 18:14:44 <ankh>	hah fun idea
Jan 20 18:15:32 <ankh>	you need someone with a Braille terminal, but the ones I've seen only show one line at a time
Jan 20 18:15:50 <ankh>	so I'm guessing the pictures won't work
Jan 20 18:16:20 <ankh>	e.g. https://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_960w/Boston/2011-2020/2013/09/06/BostonGlobe.com/EditorialOpinion/Images/WORKING%20DISABLED-171992.jpg
Jan 20 18:16:23 <ankh>	(for schoppenhauer)
Jan 20 18:24:06 <schoppenhauer>	ankh: yes, I know they show only one line. I tried to keep the information on the image itselves small
Jan 20 18:24:47 <ankh>	ok. i don't have access to a Braille terminal i'm afraid. It's 6pm on a Friday here, but some of the likely candidates may also be in Europe.
Jan 20 18:26:52 <schoppenhauer>	ok

Feb 07 10:24:27 <b4n>	joanie: You should have received some logs by mail, but tell me if you need anything more
Feb 07 10:24:40 <joanie>	b4n: ok thanks
Feb 07 10:24:41 <b4n>	or if you prefer me to attach them to the report
Feb 07 10:24:54 <joanie>	i prefer to be done with this mess ;)
Feb 07 10:25:02 <joanie>	so if I have them in email, great
Feb 07 10:25:25 <b4n>	:)
Feb 07 10:25:48 <b4n>	MATE1.16/GTK3 is almost there I think
Feb 07 10:25:59 <b4n>	1.8/GTK2 not so much I'm afraid
Feb 07 10:26:19 <b4n>	not sure what's so diffrenet between thos 2 setups, the mate-panel itself shouldn't have changed too much
Feb 07 10:26:48 <joanie>	At some point I think it's time to give up. How old is 1.8?
Feb 07 10:26:53 <joanie>	years?
Feb 07 10:27:35 <b4n>	2-3 years apparently
Feb 07 10:27:47 <b4n>	last point release is from 2015-03-13
Feb 07 10:27:56 <b4n>	first release from 2014-03-04
Feb 07 10:33:21 <joanie>	b4n: point of clarification: Did you send the Gtk3 debug logs for comparison, or are those chatty too?
Feb 07 10:34:05 <b4n>	the GTK3 ones are not as chatty at all, but they contain the extra announcmenet after the menu I mentioned
Feb 07 10:34:19 <joanie>	aha ok thanks
Feb 07 10:34:31 <b4n>	the 2 GTK3 ones are very similar though
Feb 07 10:37:15 <joanie>	you're getting name-changed events that I'm not
Feb 07 10:38:59 <b4n>	oh?  FWIW I'm in French locale here, but I doubt it should matter
Feb 07 10:39:21 <joanie>	agreed re not mattering (in theory)
Feb 07 10:39:47 <joanie>	I wonder if it's due to a panel applet
Feb 07 10:40:01 <b4n>	oh
Feb 07 10:40:03 <joanie>	anyhoo, we cannot just ignore name-changes
Feb 07 10:40:12 <b4n>	I have the clock with seconds
Feb 07 10:40:14 <joanie>	so lemme see if I can come up with something
Feb 07 10:40:17 <b4n>	lemme see chat hapens if I disable it
Feb 07 10:41:05 <b4n>	nah it's not the clock
Feb 07 10:41:55 <joanie>	while I look for a hack, mind verifying that an english session doesn't change the situation for you?
Feb 07 10:42:08 <b4n>	I was on it
Feb 07 10:42:13 <b4n>	and apparently it does somehow
Feb 07 10:42:19 <joanie>	heh
Feb 07 10:42:24 <joanie>	ok, lemme switch to french
Feb 07 10:43:15 <b4n>	yeah definitely I don't get the announce after
Feb 07 10:43:45 <joanie>	you changing the whole session or just relaunching mate-panel with a new locale?
Feb 07 10:43:59 <b4n>	though, I still get context announcement (panel frame/panel panel before applications menu) a bit randomly
Feb 07 10:44:12 <b4n>	joanie: I just relaunched the panel with LANGUAGE=C
Feb 07 10:44:17 <joanie>	ok
Feb 07 10:45:38 <b4n>	(FWIW, the GTK2 tests are all done in an English session)
Feb 07 10:45:53 <joanie>	I can confirm the french problem
Feb 07 10:45:56 <joanie>	weird
Feb 07 10:46:35 <b4n>	does the name actually change?
Feb 07 10:47:53 <joanie>	it doesn't look like it changes, and that's what I plan to hack around once I verify that's the case
Feb 07 10:48:09 <joanie>	but it would be nice if the bogus events were not emitted
Feb 07 10:48:24 <joanie>	perhaps that is something you can investigate on your end?
Feb 07 10:48:32 <joanie>	and fix wherever the bug is?
Feb 07 10:48:34 <b4n>	yeah
Feb 07 10:48:39 <joanie>	thanks!
Feb 07 10:48:40 <b4n>	if it's not in GTK :D
Feb 07 10:49:03 <joanie>	if it is in Gtk, you'd be fixing even more
Feb 07 10:49:24 <joanie>	and there are some conditions it's hard to hack around
Feb 07 10:49:26 <b4n>	yeah, but I'd have to battle a lot more to get it committed ^^
Feb 07 10:49:34 <b4n>	yeah
Feb 07 10:49:41 <b4n>	I'll investigate
Feb 07 10:49:48 <joanie>	thanks again :)
Feb 07 10:51:30 <b4n>	np, thanks for those fixes already :)
Feb 07 10:53:39 <b4n>	ok I think I got it
Feb 07 10:53:51 <b4n>	(in the code)
Feb 07 10:57:17 <b4n>	yep
Feb 07 10:57:29 <b4n>	absurd bug in mate-panel
Feb 07 11:05:28 <joanie>	b4n: you found the name-change bug?
Feb 07 11:05:33 <b4n>	yes
Feb 07 11:05:47 <joanie>	if you can fix it in mate-panel, then I'd prefer that be the solution
Feb 07 11:06:18 <b4n>	joanie: https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-panel/pull/525
Feb 07 11:06:26 <b4n>	yes it's totally a mate-panel bug
Feb 07 11:07:09 <joanie>	you rock
Feb 07 11:07:25 <joanie>	lemme see if I can see what your logs reveal about gtk+ 2
Feb 07 11:07:33 <b4n>	:)
Feb 07 11:27:02 <joanie>	b4n: could you see if the problem also exists when you use LibreOffice with the old mate-panel?
Feb 07 11:27:10 <joanie>	in English locale
Feb 07 11:27:20 <joanie>	sorry, the problem being the gtk+ 2 stuff
Feb 07 11:27:24 <joanie>	not the language stuff
Feb 07 11:27:47 <b4n>	you want me to try and hit Alt+F1 from inside LO under MATE1.8/GTK2 ?
Feb 07 11:27:53 <joanie>	yes please
Feb 07 11:27:56 <b4n>	sure
Feb 07 11:28:06 <joanie>	thanks for saying what I mean more clearly than I can
Feb 07 11:28:08 <joanie>	;)
Feb 07 11:28:11 <joanie>	more coffee please
Feb 07 11:30:13 <b4n>	joanie: same issue about re-announcing the app
Feb 07 11:30:20 <joanie>	ok thanks
Feb 07 11:30:24 <b4n>	I can send you the log if you want
Feb 07 11:30:44 <joanie>	not yet
Feb 07 11:31:09 <b4n>	(BTW for some reason I don't see the accessible-name issue there event though the code is clearly broken the same… I won't complain though)
Feb 07 11:35:14 <joanie>	b4n: if you run gtk3-demo in the old MATE environment, do you also see the problem?
Feb 07 11:35:39 <b4n>	lemme see
Feb 07 11:39:52 <b4n>	joanie: yes.  and I got 2 times where it cutoff the menu speech Firefox-like (before your fix)
Feb 07 11:40:13 <joanie>	so this seems to be a bug in the old MATE panel
Feb 07 11:40:34 <joanie>	The firefox issue was something I saw
Feb 07 11:41:17 <b4n>	well, the fact the window is announced probably comes from the X grabs/ungrabs that happens when hitting Alt+F1
Feb 07 11:41:31 <b4n>	why the menu doesn't take over though I don't know
Feb 07 11:41:59 <joanie>	but I don't see sanity checking window events across the board in Orca master in order to work around a bug in an old version of mate-panel
Feb 07 11:42:27 <b4n>	we don't have thos events in the GTK3 version?
Feb 07 11:42:50 <b4n>	but if you give me a moment, I can try mate-panel 1.16 GTK2 on the old thing
Feb 07 11:43:03 <joanie>	ok
Feb 07 11:51:33 <b4n>	1.16/GTK2 doesn't help
Feb 07 11:51:59 *	joanie sighs
Feb 07 11:52:12 <joanie>	and the problem is fixed for firefox?
Feb 07 11:52:37 <b4n>	yes
Feb 07 11:53:02 <joanie>	and why can't the Gtk+ issue be fixed in Gtk+ ?
Feb 07 11:53:23 <b4n>	wait.
Feb 07 11:53:26 <joanie>	because it still means sanity checking events across the board
Feb 07 11:53:50 <joanie>	just in case people are using MATE with Gtk+ 2
Feb 07 11:54:05 <joanie>	when a lot of users aren't using mate and if they are have hopefully switched to Gtk+ 3
Feb 07 11:54:49 <b4n>	joanie: it *might* be possibel to somehow filter those events from the a11y part, but it might miss some legitmiate onew then IIUC
Feb 07 11:55:21 <joanie>	b4n: making the change / doing the filtering where?
Feb 07 11:55:30 <b4n>	yes
Feb 07 11:55:42 <joanie>	yes what?
Feb 07 11:55:59 <b4n>	that filtering on GTK side might cause problesm too
Feb 07 11:56:25 <joanie>	so in Gtk+ 2, correct?
Feb 07 11:56:31 <b4n>	those extra events are emitted during an X grab, and if the active window changes during it, it would get ignored
Feb 07 11:56:45 <b4n>	joanie: AFAIK there's the very same issue in GTK3
Feb 07 11:57:17 <joanie>	but are you seeing this problem with mate-panel Gtk+ 3?
Feb 07 11:57:20 <joanie>	I'm not
Feb 07 11:57:30 <b4n>	no I'm not
Feb 07 11:57:44 <joanie>	so is the very same issue in Gtk+ 3?
Feb 07 11:58:02 <b4n>	I meant the extra events
Feb 07 11:58:08 <b4n>	but lemme check again
Feb 07 11:58:17 <joanie>	Then why are we not seeing the chattiness?
Feb 07 11:58:26 <joanie>	Firefox emits extra events
Feb 07 11:58:32 <joanie>	but check some other app
Feb 07 12:01:14 <b4n>	joanie: I don't know why it works on my GTK3 box
Feb 07 12:01:39 <joanie>	you mean no chattiness in Gtk+3 mate-panel?
Feb 07 12:01:47 <b4n>	but logging the events I deveinitely see what I described there https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=776854
Feb 07 12:02:14 <b4n>	joanie: no, not there yet: no chattiness under a proper MATE 1.16 GTK3
Feb 07 12:02:59 <b4n>	the same setup as I had all along, the one where the language change fixed it further
Feb 07 12:04:14 <joanie>	So if I'm understanding you correctly, you're asking me to attempt to sanity check window-activation related events coming from all apps and toolkits for all users
Feb 07 12:04:36 <joanie>	in order to address a problem which only occurs if the user is using MATE panel built with Gtk+ 2
Feb 07 12:04:39 <joanie>	?
Feb 07 12:04:43 <b4n>	…or anythin else that would shut this up
Feb 07 12:05:10 <joanie>	I would suggest you fix that downstream
Feb 07 12:05:23 <b4n>	actually I don't understand why Orca isn't stopping the speach from the activate/deactivate events although another app is focused
Feb 07 12:05:42 <b4n>	(the panel)
Feb 07 12:06:34 <joanie>	probably because we don't normally see bogus events like that?
Feb 07 12:06:45 <b4n>	maybe
Feb 07 12:06:48 <joanie>	;)
Feb 07 12:07:04 <b4n>	but isn't the fact it doesn't happen on our GTK3 setups just that Orca shuts it up?
Feb 07 12:07:10 <b4n>	I shuold probably check teh event log though
Feb 07 12:07:35 <joanie>	Orca isn't doing anything special for mate-panel
Feb 07 12:07:43 <b4n>	no
Feb 07 12:07:44 <joanie>	regardless of version or gtk+ version
Feb 07 12:08:06 <b4n>	but in normal situation, if the currently focused app, it shuts the previous on up, right?
Feb 07 12:08:23 <b4n>	if the currently focused app changes*
Feb 07 12:08:30 <b4n>	one*
Feb 07 12:09:17 <joanie>	I'm not sure I follow what you're saying
Feb 07 12:09:18 <joanie>	however
Feb 07 12:11:10 <b4n>	shouldnt the fact that the panel gets focused shut up the other app (e.g. the terminal)?
Feb 07 12:11:24 <b4n>	I'm literally hearing the whole announce of the current app
Feb 07 12:11:33 <b4n>	it's not cut off or anything
Feb 07 12:11:34 <joanie>	because of the window:activate event
Feb 07 12:11:41 <joanie>	?
Feb 07 12:11:42 <b4n>	and then, after all that, I get the announce of the menu
Feb 07 12:12:28 <b4n>	my point is, shouldn't one of those be cut off by the other becoming the ative one?
Feb 07 12:12:53 <joanie>	probably
Feb 07 12:13:49 <joanie>	but Orca deliberately doesn't interrupt speech if a window was recently activated
Feb 07 12:13:59 <joanie>	because then it won't present the new window
Feb 07 12:14:21 <b4n>	oh
Feb 07 12:16:05 <b4n>	joanie: well I don't know, but in my GTK3 logs I see the very same window deactivate/activate events
Feb 07 12:16:14 <b4n>	yet it's not a problem apparently
Feb 07 12:16:47 <joanie>	is the behavior with mate-panel built with Gtk+ 3 fixed?
Feb 07 12:16:56 <b4n>	1s
Feb 07 12:17:19 <joanie>	?
Feb 07 12:18:31 <b4n>	gimme a moment
Feb 07 12:18:35 <joanie>	k
Feb 07 12:18:49 <b4n>	building a GTK3 one is a lot more annoying on a GTK2 environment than a GTK2 one :)
Feb 07 12:18:56 <joanie>	ha
Feb 07 12:27:14 <b4n>	joanie: mate-panel 1.16/GTK3 doen't magically fix it
Feb 07 12:27:50 <b4n>	it feels like it happens slightly less often, but it's highly random
Feb 07 12:27:51 <joanie>	so before you were not seeing the problem and now you are?
Feb 07 12:28:14 <joanie>	because before my changes I was seeing the problem and now I am not
Feb 07 12:28:22 <joanie>	using Fedora 25
Feb 07 12:29:00 <b4n>	no no I'm talking about putting a MATE 1.16 GTK3 panel on Debian Jessie, which has otherwise MATE 1.8
Feb 07 12:29:24 <b4n>	behavior on my Debian Sid box is still good
Feb 07 12:30:05 <joanie>	so what's up with Debian Jessie then?
Feb 07 12:30:32 <joanie>	and why is it my job to fix it in Orca?
Feb 07 12:30:40 <joanie>	s/fix/"fix"/
Feb 07 12:31:22 <b4n>	when I hit Alt+F1 on that Debian Jessie (with orca master obviously), it often announces the current window before announcing the menu
Feb 07 12:32:39 <joanie>	what I meant with "what's up with Debian Jessie then?" is what condition is present in Debian Jessie that might be responsible for it not working there?
Feb 07 12:32:54 <b4n>	whether it's your job or not I don't know, and don't mean to force it upon you.  But I don't think the events are tremendously different from the ones I get on my Sid box where it does work
Feb 07 12:33:28 <b4n>	joanie: ah.  I have no clue what's so different.  It has GTK2 everything, maybe that's the main difference
Feb 07 12:34:17 <joanie>	and you have the latest ATK? Or at least a newer one?
Feb 07 12:34:32 <joanie>	I think that some event filtering was done in ATK a year or two ago
Feb 07 12:34:49 <joanie>	and there have been various and sundry fixes in AT-SPI2
Feb 07 12:35:37 <b4n>	I probably have olde ones.  ATK 2.14
Feb 07 12:35:37 <joanie>	and even if I did sanity check everything for Debian Jessie, if that's stable Debian, they won't be including the current Orca, right?
Feb 07 12:35:50 <joanie>	yikes
Feb 07 12:36:15 <b4n>	no indeed they won't.  If it's really specific to Jessie you probably don't really care yourself
Feb 07 12:36:29 <joanie>	If things are good for a recent environment (which it sounds like they are(??)) then I think I've done enough within Orca to address this
Feb 07 12:37:03 <joanie>	which means that the bug you filed is as fixed as it is going to be
Feb 07 12:37:20 <b4n>	but as I see the very same events on both setups, I somewhat wonder it's really the environment's fault, or a different code path in Orca because of it
Feb 07 12:37:25 <b4n>	okay yeah I get that
Feb 07 12:37:44 <b4n>	I can probably live with a hack in Jessie in the meantime
Feb 07 12:38:07 <joanie>	would you like to close the bug and obsolete the patches you proposed or shall I?
Feb 07 12:38:55 <b4n>	if you don't mind I'd like to ask colleagues to test and see if there's something left I missed
Feb 07 12:39:04 <b4n>	and then I can close it, sure
Feb 07 12:39:07 <joanie>	ok
Feb 07 12:39:22 <joanie>	I'm afraid I won't be taking the patches you proposed, however
Feb 07 12:39:31 <joanie>	as I don't believe they are the right and safe thing to do
Feb 07 12:40:15 <joanie>	if you missed something in a modern environment, give me the specifics to reproduce the problem and I'll see what I can do
Feb 07 12:40:33 <b4n>	sure
Feb 07 12:40:34 <b4n>	thanks
Feb 07 12:41:03 <joanie>	np
Feb 07 12:45:49 <b4n>	joanie: ah, one last detail: I don't always get the "top expandd edg panel frame/panel" before "applications menu"
Feb 07 12:46:06 <b4n>	seems to mostly depend on which app was focused before
Feb 07 12:46:51 <b4n>	from Firefox I always get it
Feb 07 12:46:58 <b4n>	from mate-terminal almost (?) never
Feb 07 12:51:14 <joanie>	b4n: ok, I'll take a look
Feb 07 15:02:40 <joanie>	b4n: I made some more changes -- including sanity checking all windows upon activation. I hope that solves more of your problems
Feb 07 15:02:51 <joanie>	I also officially loathe mate-panel now.
Feb 07 15:02:54 *	joanie runs to meeting
Feb 07 15:47:06 <TheMuso>	Hrm. I've been fixing things in caja recently, maybe its time I get familiar with Mate panel's code...
Feb 07 17:48:40 <joanie>	TheMuso: That would be nice
Feb 07 18:03:06 <TheMuso>	joanie: All depends on how much code has to do with legacy systray stuff.
Feb 07 18:06:28 <TheMuso>	Anyways, need to get more familiar with the problem first.
Feb 08 01:11:47 <TheMuso>	joanie: Is there a bug I can look at to better learn what the problems with mate panel are?
Feb 08 02:08:27 <joanie>	TheMuso: The biggest issue seems to be related to event ordering. The menu selection happens first; then we get the window:activate events. Beyond that something(tm) mate-panel does is convincing Firefox to emit window:activate and state-changed:active and state-changed:focused events that are bogus.
Feb 08 02:09:06 <joanie>	TheMuso: b4n claims this cannot be fixed in mate-panel and that it's a gtk+ issue.
Feb 08 02:10:00 <joanie>	But I am hoping you can find a way to get the event ordering reversed so that the window first becomes active (or at least announces that) and then emits the selection-change event.
Feb 08 02:10:26 <joanie>	the amount of sanity checking I am doing seems unfortunate
Feb 08 02:10:52 <joanie>	"thank mate-panel, kids"
Feb 08 02:12:17 <joanie>	also I think there may be some race condition or two going on
Feb 08 02:12:46 <joanie>	because I don't always get the same events
Feb 08 02:13:09 <joanie>	but the window activation following the menu selection seems pretty reliable
Feb 08 02:32:54 <TheMuso>	Ok, thanks for the summary. I'll see what I can find.
Feb 08 02:33:06 <joanie>	you rock. thanks!!
Feb 08 03:34:33 <b4n>	TheMuso: my take is that it't not really mate-panel's fault but X focus out/in/out events upon keyboard grabs combined with a window (the panels) that don't get focused
Feb 08 03:34:54 <b4n>	but heck, maybe I'm wrong, let's hope so :)
Feb 08 03:38:03 <TheMuso>	Well, according to what I am seeing in accerciser, I get bounds changed signals for menus in the applications menu first, before any window activation event. If I'm understanding joanie correct, the window activate event should always be the first event from a newly focused window...
Feb 08 03:38:31 <TheMuso>	Ad state-changed::showing events too.
Feb 08 03:38:34 <TheMuso>	before window activate
Feb 08 03:39:02 <joanie>	The state-changed:selected one is the key, however
Feb 08 03:40:01 <joanie>	b4n: have you had time to test the latest master
Feb 08 03:40:20 <joanie>	as indicated I added more sad hacks and updated existing sad hacks
Feb 08 03:40:28 <b4n>	TheMuso: the panel's frame never gets actually activated as a window.  that's the WM choice, and it's useful not to get focus on the manel after triggering that, but having it back in the poriginal window
Feb 08 03:40:34 <joanie>	and even did a global sanity check just for mate-panel
Feb 08 03:40:40 *	joanie grumbles some more
Feb 08 03:40:53 <b4n>	joanie: on Debian Sid/GTK3 the announcement seems consistent, good :)
Feb 08 03:41:03 <joanie>	And I'd like to be able to cross this one off my list
Feb 08 03:41:09 <joanie>	yay for good! :)
Feb 08 03:41:13 <TheMuso>	Yup can confirm with accerciser, Fedora 25, mate 1.16.
Feb 08 03:41:43 <joanie>	TheMuso: if you can fix it, you will become my hero
Feb 08 03:42:01 <TheMuso>	joanie: I'll see what I can do. No promises. :)
Feb 08 03:42:12 <joanie>	thanks! :)
Feb 08 03:42:59 <b4n>	joanie: no luck on 1.8/GTK2, but IIUC you don't care too much about that
Feb 08 03:43:33 <joanie>	I'm having a really hard time caring, sorry.
Feb 08 03:43:43 <TheMuso>	Accessibility in GTK2 is quite a different beast to GTK3.
Feb 08 03:43:45 <joanie>	Especially given it may be something already filtered out in changes in ATK
Feb 08 03:43:53 <joanie>	or AT-SPI2
Feb 08 03:44:46 <joanie>	and it's Gtk+ 2 ffs ;)
Feb 08 03:45:10 <b4n>	TheMuso: is it from an external POV?  the implementation seemed fairly similar between GAIL's *Accessible and the Gtk*Accesssible
Feb 08 03:45:37 <joanie>	anyway b4n if it's decent enough, could you please comment on that bug and close it?
Feb 08 03:46:12 <b4n>	joanie: yes.  I'll prepare a setup so colleagues can test today and I'll do that
Feb 08 03:46:20 <joanie>	thanks!
Feb 08 03:46:36 <TheMuso>	b4n: In GTK+2, accessibility is implemented in a separate module. In GTK+3, its part of the core GTK 3 library, so it is possible for any custom accessible code to directly inherrit from GTK's own accessibility objects.
Feb 08 03:46:54 <b4n>	TheMuso: yeah I got that part :)
Feb 08 03:47:14 <b4n>	though in GTK2 it was somewhat possible too due to the ATK registry but well
Feb 08 03:47:30 <joanie>	there were also a bunch of fixes for a11y issues that went into gtk+3 that are not in gtk+2
Feb 08 03:47:54 <TheMuso>	Yeah, I know, but I don't know how well that worked, and I am not sure I care really, because the way things are done in GTK+3 is cleaner.
Feb 08 03:48:17 <b4n>	yeah, post 3.6 it's better
Feb 08 03:48:20 *	joanie would like gtk+2 to die
Feb 08 03:48:38 <b4n>	between 3.2 and 3.6, err.  world blinked for a year
Feb 08 03:48:38 *	joanie hopes it suffers too
Feb 08 03:49:45 <TheMuso>	joanie: From a code implementation POV a11y wise, yeah GTK 2 can die as far as I'm concerned too.
Feb 08 03:49:59 <joanie>	:)
Feb 08 03:52:44 <TheMuso>	Ok not sure if this was tried, but I get the same behavior when opening a menu with the mouse as well.
Feb 08 03:53:04 <TheMuso>	So I don't think it has anything to do with the keyboard grab code, but of course that makes sense really.
Feb 08 08:26:47 <joanie>	TheMuso and or b4n: Take a look at the mate-panel applets using accerciser.
Feb 08 08:27:07 <joanie>	there is nothing connecting applets to the panel
Feb 08 08:27:18 <joanie>	no parent-child relationship
Feb 08 08:27:39 <joanie>	no alternate accessible relation type
Feb 08 08:27:52 <joanie>	applets are their own applications and lack children
Feb 08 08:28:02 <joanie>	like the entry of the dictionary applet
Feb 08 08:28:30 <joanie>	those absent children emit events, mind you
Feb 08 08:28:58 <joanie>	you just cannot locate them from the top down (i.e. in Accerciser's tree of accessibles)
Feb 08 08:29:46 <joanie>	b4n: addressing those sorts of issues should be done in mate-panel and/or its applets and NOT through sad Orca hacks that make me cry ;)
Feb 08 08:30:33 <joanie>	so if you have spare time to try to make mate-panel suck less, focusing on the non-Orca side of a fix or hack would be the way to go
Feb 08 09:11:06 <b4n>	joanie: yes, applets should likely be tied with the panel through AtkSocket/AtkPlug
Feb 08 09:11:31 <b4n>	or mate-panel should stop having those as separate apps as their current sutff only works under X anyway
Feb 08 09:13:05 *	joanie nods
Feb 08 09:13:43 <joanie>	if you work on a solution that doesn't JustWork(tm) with Orca, lemme know.
Feb 08 09:14:51 <b4n>	okay
Feb 08 09:15:37 <b4n>	not sure I'll have time for that one "soon" as it seems not trivial, but I'll keep it in mind if no one else beats me to it (:wink: to anyone interested)
Feb 08 15:25:02 <TheMuso>	b4n: Yeah, as much as having them as separate executables may bring some protectino to the panel, maybe it needs to be a plugin interface using libpeas, which can still allow people to write applets in python/any GObject introspection compatible language.
Feb 08 15:25:16 <TheMuso>	Which should work going forward in the wayland world.
Feb 09 03:37:21 <b4n>	TheMuso: IIUC that's already working, and they support in-process applets too, just that they prefer the external ones.  but yeah they probably need changing something if they don't wanna get stuck to X forever

Feb 15 09:35:11 <b4n>	joanie: about my Thunderbird table: now I have proper Table accessible (had to change a bunch of things, that stuff is bizarre, but whatever), but still no speech with master
Feb 15 09:35:29 <b4n>	braille is fine, I see in the debug log it finds the column and row headers
Feb 15 09:36:01 <joanie>	b4n: I cannot look now. I can take a look later.
Feb 15 09:36:07 <joanie>	You have a patch or try build?
Feb 15 09:36:14 <joanie>	patch for the tbird table I mean
Feb 15 09:36:49 <b4n>	not published yet, but I will
Feb 15 09:37:00 <joanie>	when you have that, please email me.
Feb 15 09:37:07 <b4n>	anyway, I guess on my side it's alright now as the braille part is seen
Feb 15 09:37:11 <b4n>	joanie: okay, thanks
Feb 15 09:37:12 <joanie>	got a deadline I need to meet in the meantime
Feb 15 09:37:37 <joanie>	thanks for implementing the table iface :)
Feb 15 09:38:16 <b4n>	actually I switched elements because there are weird things in XUL, but well
Feb 15 09:38:38 <b4n>	but in the end yeah, better :)
Feb 15 09:42:02 <b4n>	joanie: BTW, Orca uses the Text interface and not the accessible-name... I guess it's expected? but that's not really appropriate for my case because the text is merely what's displayed, and it's abbreviated.  anyway, we can deal wit hthis later, no biggie, just mentioning
Feb 15 09:42:57 <joanie>	it sometimes uses the name and sometimes the text depending on the situation. hack arounds due to miscellaneous crap.
Feb 15 09:43:07 *	joanie goes back to deadline work
Feb 15 16:15:28 <joanie>	b4n: Should be fixed in Orca master now.
Feb 15 16:15:53 <joanie>	related aside: Now that Orca is presenting the week numbers, I wonder if the row headers should include some indication of being a week
Feb 15 16:16:18 <joanie>	otherwise you get the week number (just the int) followed by "row header" followed by the selected day in the calendar

Apr 05 15:33:27 *	Now talking on #a11y
Apr 06 06:50:19 *	mclasen hasn't been here in a while
Apr 06 06:51:38 <TheMuso>	Its pretty quiet round these parts.
Apr 06 06:53:05 <mclasen>	I just looked at a11y vs sandboxes again
Apr 06 06:53:13 <mclasen>	and did a quick experiment
Apr 06 06:53:23 <mclasen>	point d-feet at the a11y bus
Apr 06 06:53:27 <mclasen>	locate the bus name of gnome-shell
Apr 06 06:53:37 <mclasen>	and randomly call DoAction(20) on some object
Apr 06 06:53:45 <mclasen>	for a  very sudden exit from your session :-(
Apr 06 06:54:06 <mclasen>	so I am coming to the conclusion that we can't allow the a11y bus into sandboxes at all, with the current state of affairs
Apr 06 06:57:08 <TheMuso>	No idea on whether anybody else has tested a11y with flatpack GTK apps. I certainly haven't so this doesn't surprise me.
Apr 06 06:57:23 <mclasen>	its not about flatpak at all
Apr 06 06:57:43 <mclasen>	just about allowing everybody to inject unvalidated command into everybody else
Apr 06 06:57:54 <TheMuso>	Oh right.
Apr 06 06:59:28 <mclasen>	my simpleminded idea before this experiment was that maybe this needs to be split into a 'sendkeys' interface on the AT / registry side that sandboxed apps would be allowed to talk to, and an 'injectcommands' interface that they expose, but can't talk to
Apr 06 07:00:32 <mclasen>	but there's too many layers here for me to say how feasible this is
Apr 06 07:00:47 <TheMuso>	If you are talking about keyboard/mouse input specifically, then there is actually work needing to be done there indeed.
Apr 06 07:01:07 <mclasen>	that is the only thing that apps need to actively send out over the bus, right ?
Apr 06 07:02:09 <TheMuso>	Well, there is a couple of things I think. There is the atk/at-spi action API/object, and then there is tools like orca needing to intercept input events to allow the user to execute keyboard shortcuts to control Orca.
Apr 06 07:02:35 <mclasen>	it would be nicer if ATs could get their input interception done at the compositor 
Apr 06 07:02:53 <TheMuso>	Yep, GTK currently does the work now.
Apr 06 07:02:58 <mclasen>	but thats a bit complementary
Apr 06 07:03:15 <TheMuso>	Funny you should say that, I've been looking into what is needed spec wise to coordinate and coolaborate on getting such a thing into the comositor.
Apr 06 07:03:31 <mclasen>	we're in the same spot with input methods:
Apr 06 07:03:38 <TheMuso>	Right.
Apr 06 07:03:54 <mclasen>	would be nice to do compositor-side (text protocol) but we're using the client-side ibus approach just fine for now
Apr 06 07:04:03 <mclasen>	and unsurprisingly, it has a similar issue with sandboxes
Apr 06 07:04:09 <TheMuso>	I was needing to look into this for Unity 8... Even though that is no longer a thing, the work still needs doing.
Apr 06 07:04:31 <mclasen>	but a bit more manageable, since there's not 'inject arbitrary commands' api that goes with it
Apr 06 07:04:58 <TheMuso>	Orca via at-spi using X also controls the mouse pointer, which again is something needing to be done with the compositor.
Apr 06 07:05:41 <mclasen>	yeah, that calls for a privileged DeviceEventController api in the compositor
Apr 06 07:06:22 <TheMuso>	Right. Down the road, Orca will also want to intercept touch events too.
Apr 06 07:06:53 <TheMuso>	At least I think it will.
Apr 06 07:06:56 <TheMuso>	Others may disagree.
Apr 06 07:07:48 <mclasen>	I would be happy to find a solution that makes actual screen reading work in sandboxes
Apr 06 07:08:01 <mclasen>	no need to go all in, some things in orca may just not be a good idea...
Apr 06 07:09:50 <TheMuso>	Right, I need to better familiarize myself with this I guess.
Apr 06 07:35:00 <mclasen>	as always I come away thinking a simple client-side 'call out to pulseaudio' solution would get us 80% of the way for screen reading :-(
Apr 06 07:36:08 <TheMuso>	Well Orca uses speech-dispatcher, which in turn uses pulseaudio.
Apr 06 07:37:19 <mclasen>	I'm just pining for the simplicitly of 'no bus, no abstraction, no mess'
Apr 06 07:38:34 <mclasen>	but I need to be on my way. Later!

Apr 20 04:15:14 <alexarnaud>	Hello joanie, have done something special to support Google Doc? We try to have focus tracking with Compiz and Ezoom on it but it makes us crazy because of we think non-standard AT-SPI events. If you have any information on that we really appreciate it. :)
Apr 20 04:15:14 <alexarnaud>	Thanks in advance.
Apr 20 04:22:19 <joanie>	alexarnaud: Google docs accessibility works via a complex ARIA liveregion hack done by Google. Orca has ARIA liveregion support. My guess is that your magnifiers don't.
Apr 20 04:23:30 <joanie>	But this is, presumably, also an issue for other platforms. So maybe Google Docs has additional support for magnifiers.
Apr 20 04:23:58 <joanie>	Were I you, I'd figure out how Windows users with low vision use Google Docs with their magnifiers.
Apr 20 05:39:06 <alexarnaud>	joanie: thank you very much for the precision
Apr 20 08:09:20 <alexarnaud>	joanie: is the aria liveregion events come from FIrefox to AT-SPI2?
Apr 20 08:09:59 <joanie>	alexarnaud: need to walk away now, but yes
Apr 20 08:10:10 <joanie>	or really they come from google docs to Gecko
Apr 20 08:10:21 <joanie>	and from there to AT-SPI2
Apr 20 08:10:52 <alexarnaud>	ksamak: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions
Apr 20 08:18:43 <alexarnaud>	joanie: thank you

Apr 24 08:40:52 <ksamak>	joanie: hi, i'm working on compiz's zoom/focus tracking, and i'm kinda at a loss on one point, if you had a couple minutes, i'd be glad to ask you a couple questions
Apr 24 08:41:23 <ksamak>	i'm trying to get the aria live regions working in compiz, in order to make sense of google docs for the tracking.
Apr 24 08:41:34 <joanie>	good luck! :)
Apr 24 08:41:44 <ksamak>	yeah, i know...
Apr 24 08:41:55 <ksamak>	i had a look in orca, but i can't really find the entry points from libatspi to get these info
Apr 24 08:41:56 <joanie>	I just know about its use of live regions for screen reader support
Apr 24 08:42:07 <joanie>	and what google docs does is tell screen readers what to say
Apr 24 08:42:37 <joanie>	i.e. you move to the next line and google docs gives the screen reader the text of that line
Apr 24 08:42:38 <ksamak>	joanie: you think it works just because gdocs thought about screen readers, but not magnifiers?
Apr 24 08:42:52 <joanie>	not as something with navigable, accessible text
Apr 24 08:42:56 <joanie>	ksamak: I dunno
Apr 24 08:43:04 <joanie>	what I told alexarnaud and what I'll tell you is this:
Apr 24 08:43:07 <ksamak>	mmmm, that's pretty bad
Apr 24 08:43:25 <joanie>	Presumably this is something Windows and Mac magnifier users have encountered
Apr 24 08:43:28 <joanie>	What do they do?
Apr 24 08:43:31 <joanie>	Does it work?
Apr 24 08:43:48 <joanie>	If it works in those platforms, there must be something additional google docs is doing for magnification users
Apr 24 08:44:02 <joanie>	if it doesn't work in those platforms, you likely won't get it working in ours
Apr 24 08:44:09 <ksamak>	yeah, but my only backend in atspi anyway, so i'm trying to contentrate on getting the most of it
Apr 24 08:44:11 <joanie>	that's all I can tell you. Sorry!
Apr 24 08:44:30 <ksamak>	ok, so nothing special from orca, it just get these lines of text.
Apr 24 08:44:42 <joanie>	it gets stuff to say
Apr 24 08:44:44 <ksamak>	no special api, no special treatment of some events
Apr 24 08:44:49 <ksamak>	ok then
Apr 24 08:44:50 <joanie>	it takes it and speaks it
Apr 24 08:44:52 <joanie>	unmodified
Apr 24 08:45:27 <joanie>	and that's not just for the editor. it's for menu selection changes, toolbar focus changes, the whole. freakin'. interface.
Apr 24 08:45:43 <joanie>	gotta run now.
Apr 24 08:45:47 <ksamak>	orca doesn't have fine grain, like i'm on the "a" right now, or "this word is hilighted"
Apr 24 08:45:54 <ksamak>	joanie: ok, thanks for the insight
Apr 24 08:46:09 *	ksamak is gonna try and get some luck somewhere
Apr 24 08:46:19 <joanie>	if you arrow to the "a" in a document, google docs emits a live region event with the string "a"
Apr 24 08:46:30 <joanie>	google docs has its own commands for screen readers
Apr 24 08:46:39 <joanie>	Orca just spews out what google docs gives it
Apr 24 08:46:40 <ksamak>	yeah, the question is how can i get this event, i can't find this
Apr 24 08:47:01 <joanie>	they are text-changed and/or object:children-changed events
Apr 24 08:47:10 <joanie>	register for them
Apr 24 08:47:15 <joanie>	see what gets spewed out
Apr 24 08:47:17 <ksamak>	ok, maybe i'm not looking hard enough on the children changed
Apr 24 08:47:36 <joanie>	the event.any_data is the child
Apr 24 08:47:39 <ksamak>	i got the text objects, but they don't follow at-spi standart...
Apr 24 08:47:41 <joanie>	see what it exposes
Apr 24 08:47:56 <ksamak>	at least the text-changed doesn't
Apr 24 08:48:02 <ksamak>	thank, ill look harder
Apr 24 08:48:11 <joanie>	it's ATK, but again this is a serious hack done by google; not actual text objects.
Apr 24 08:48:21 <joanie>	good luck!
Apr 24 08:48:51 <ksamak>	thanks. i know, i'm already making recursions all over the place to get out of this weird heirarchy and find the right objects...
Apr 24 08:54:17 <alexarnaud>	hum, I don't see anything specific for screen magnifiers.
Apr 24 08:54:56 <alexarnaud>	I don't know if ZoomText is able to work with Google Doc due I have only Compiz to test.

May 30 12:23:45 <alexarnaud>	I'm not able to reproduce it with the steps you've provided.

Jun 19 12:18:07 *	Now talking on #a11y
Jun 20 09:59:59 <alexarnaud>	Hello joanie. As usuel, sorry to disturb you. At Hypra, We are looking on FIrefox bugs specific to Linux to make it fix by the a11y team or by developers paid by Hypra but we have difficulties to understand and to determine how many workaround you have  done into Orca and if bugs are not reported on the Mozilla BTS. For example,this one : https://mail.gnome.org/archives/orca-list/2017-March/msg00054.html , is it reported upstream ?
Jun 20 09:59:59 <alexarnaud>	If we have to disable e10s, how could we have this one resolved in Orca : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1260598 ? 
Jun 20 10:00:00 <alexarnaud>	If you prefer I could send you an e-mail but we really want to collaborate with you but it's harder for us to understand Mozilla related bugs than we do in other apps.
Jun 20 10:00:50 <joanie>	alexarnaud: I thought I was already working around that one.
Jun 20 10:01:37 <joanie>	regardless, right now I'm working on implementing ARIA 1.1 (starting with low-hanging fruit) in Gecko (since I'm new to the code).
Jun 20 10:01:44 <joanie>	and I need to focus on that.
Jun 20 10:08:40 <alexarnaud>	joanie: the ctrl+tab issue is not resolved without e10s. I have tried with Nightly one minute ago and Orca only announces the current focused item. It's a major issue for users. We really try to make users as efficient as in Windows with NVDA. Blind persons have also lot of difficulties with their disability so they want (and I understand) to be efficient on their computer. 
Jun 20 10:08:40 <alexarnaud>	If we says e10s will not be usable for years we need to find a solution for this non-e10s bug.
Jun 20 10:09:05 <joanie>	alexarnaud: ok
Jun 20 10:09:52 <alexarnaud>	I'll try to ping a11y  team on this bug.
Jun 20 10:10:51 <alexarnaud>	Do you think you could five a little bit of time to help us to understand more why you have to workaround lot of gecko issues ?
Jun 20 10:11:07 <joanie>	not right now sorry!
Jun 20 10:14:02 <ankh>	i think in fact that is the answer, alexarnaud - people are busy, and bugs don't get fixed upstream (and often there's lengthy discussion about whether it's actually a bug) and people demand/need that the a11y tools work regardless
Jun 20 10:59:44 <alexarnaud>	joanie: Do you know if it is possible to use accerciser with Orca? My colleague Raphael POITEVIN is a blind person and want to check bug you've reported on Mozilla BTS but it seems accerciser is only usable by sighted and low-vision people
Jun 20 11:01:19 <alexarnaud>	each time I've tried to run accercicer with Orca accerciser becomes unresponsive.
Jun 20 11:50:00 <ankh>	i don't see a bug reported against accerciser for that
Jun 20 11:50:19 <ankh>	(you're running accerciser from the comand-line? make sure it's in the foreground!!!!!)
Jun 20 11:51:28 <ankh>	there are bugs about accerciser's accessibiliyy though
Jun 20 14:58:56 <alexarnaud>	ankh: It's possible indeed. Please ping me with my nickname when you answered me. We'll report a bug if needed.
Jun 20 14:59:10 <alexarnaud>	I go away. Have a good night :) !
Jun 20 15:09:21 <ankh>	then i can't ping you darling.
Jun 22 09:31:07 <gianlucac>	Hi! I'm trying to make my application a11y-enabled. I have custom widget, so was thinking to use the information at https://wiki.gnome.org/Accessibility/Documentation/GNOME2/AtkGuide/Custom. Do you know if it is still valid?
Jun 22 09:31:20 <gianlucac>	*custom widgets
Jun 22 09:37:17 <gianlucac>	The last editor of that page seems to be @joanie (in 2011)
Jun 22 11:18:05 <alexarnaud>	https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35654
Jun 22 11:19:32 <alexarnaud>	joanie: is the ATKCollection already available?
Jun 22 11:20:31 <joanie>	alexarnaud: no
Jun 22 11:20:33 <alexarnaud>	How Firefox works to provide structural navigation if it doesn't use AtkCollection?
Jun 22 11:20:51 <joanie>	Orca uses Atspi2
Jun 22 11:20:57 <joanie>	Atspi2 does it
Jun 22 11:21:11 <alexarnaud>	What LibreOffice should do for that ? So LibreOffice should use directly AT-SPI?
Jun 22 11:21:18 <joanie>	no
Jun 22 11:21:31 <joanie>	LibreOffice should fix their bugs related to items missing from the accessibility tree
Jun 22 11:21:55 <joanie>	if they do that, I should be able to add structural navigation support in Orca for LibreOffice in about 5 minutes -- probably less
Jun 22 11:22:26 <joanie>	I believe I've already stated this in multiple places
Jun 22 11:22:39 <alexarnaud>	joanie: and after that all will work correctly for structural navigation ? So the bug I point to you last minute is no longer useful? We should use this one ? https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35652
Jun 22 11:22:40 <joanie>	ask jean-philippe
Jun 22 11:22:51 <joanie>	lemme look
Jun 22 11:23:57 <joanie>	the first bug says what I said above about which accessibility api needs to be done
Jun 22 11:24:07 <joanie>	once atkcollection exists
Jun 22 11:24:21 <joanie>	that would be a ton more performant for LO and Gecko and everyone else to implement 
Jun 22 11:24:32 <joanie>	in the meantime, ....
Jun 22 11:24:43 <alexarnaud>	So the last bug is the good one?
Jun 22 11:24:54 <alexarnaud>	I understand indeed :).
Jun 22 11:24:57 <joanie>	it's one of them
Jun 22 11:25:14 <joanie>	look for another which I think is officially related to nvda say all
Jun 22 11:25:16 <alexarnaud>	Thanks :)!
Jun 22 11:25:24 <joanie>	somewhere in there I also answer all of these questions I believe
Jun 22 11:25:40 *	joanie goes back to work
Jun 22 12:41:53 <alexarnaud>	joanie: is Igalia always work on PDF accessibility?
Jun 22 12:41:54 <alexarnaud>	https://www.gnome.org/news/2013/02/call-for-bids-for-gnome-accessibility-work/
Jun 22 12:41:55 <alexarnaud>	I've seen two blogs posts about the a11y support and a crowd funding campaign. What's the state of tagged PDF? Do we should ask for a new campaign to continue the work on evince and popler a11y?
Jun 22 12:41:56 <alexarnaud>	Sorry to ask you so much things but we have organized a BSP and PDF a11y is one of the most requirement for users to switch to Linux and you are aware of all things related to a11y and Idalia.
Jun 22 12:46:46 <alexarnaud>	As you know as I can I try to answer question from users to help you to avoid to  do it yourself:).
Jun 22 12:47:18 <joanie>	alexarnaud: I'm in a meeting
Jun 22 13:19:31 <alexarnaud>	No problem. If you could I'll be happy otherwise I'll ask on gnome-a11y and gnome-a11y-devel. I just need to shut down my computer so you could contact me by e-mail.

Jul 04 04:42:10 <ksamak>	hi, i got a question. does anyone like joanie notice a shift in GTK3 caret-move events? like the caret is 10,10 but the annouced pos from at-spi is smt like 6,6
Jul 04 05:24:44 <joanie>	alexarnaud: We're busy I'm afraid
Jul 04 05:24:54 <joanie>	ksamak: haven't noticed that
Jul 04 05:25:07 <ksamak>	ok
Jul 04 05:25:10 <joanie>	But Orca doesn't need the precision you do
Jul 04 05:25:20 <joanie>	but it might be a deliberate fix
Jul 04 05:25:32 <joanie>	or it might be a bug :)
Jul 04 05:25:39 <ksamak>	yeah i guess that's only visual, and all the others infos are here as usual
Jul 04 05:25:59 <ksamak>	i can't put my finger on the logic of it though for now.
Jul 04 05:26:08 <ksamak>	where would you suggest looking?
Jul 04 05:26:51 <joanie>	the Gtk text stuff :) (Is there a GtkTextView?)
Jul 04 05:27:07 <ksamak>	i don't really know what box to open to be closer to a solution, i've looked into acceciser, i'm trying to make a dummy entry and check what's off
Jul 04 05:27:10 <ksamak>	ok
