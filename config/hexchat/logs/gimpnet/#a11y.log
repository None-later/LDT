Aug 31 10:58:15 <joanie>	alexarnaud: I'm in a meeting
Aug 31 10:58:27 <alexarnaud>	I've noticeed a syntax error on Orca.
Aug 31 10:58:39 <joanie>	alexarnaud: got a traceback?
Aug 31 10:58:50 <alexarnaud>	joanie: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23116287/
Aug 31 10:59:07 <joanie>	ok, will fix that. thanks

Aug 31 11:18:46 *	Now talking on #a11y
Aug 31 11:29:28 <joanie>	alexarnaud: so it seems like the issue is python3.4 -- or rather changes in python3.5 that I was using that are not in 3.4. In this particular case, the method in question was going to be removed anyway, so I've just made that change.
Aug 31 11:29:43 <joanie>	Any idea why Debian is not shipping python3.5?
Aug 31 11:32:53 <alexarnaud>	joanie: no idea, the next Debian will use python 4.5 for sure but the current stable has the 3.4.2.
Aug 31 11:33:44 <alexarnaud>	*python 3.5 sorry
Aug 31 11:33:53 *	joanie nods
Aug 31 11:34:01 <alexarnaud>	in the future Debian
Aug 31 12:02:27 <alexarnaud>	joanie: it works well :) ! Thank you very much.
Aug 31 12:02:55 <joanie>	alexarnaud: thanks for pointing it out. I obviously am not testing with older versions of Python.
Aug 31 12:19:56 <alexarnaud>	joanie: If I checked the box "speak object on the mouse" I cannot restart Orca because synthax error. You could find the log here : http://paste.ubuntu.com/23116689/
Aug 31 12:20:31 <joanie>	alexarnaud: looks like I need to bump the version of Gtk+
Aug 31 12:21:00 <joanie>	I'll add a sanity check shortly
Aug 31 12:21:53 <alexarnaud>	joanie: np, I just inform you :)
Aug 31 12:22:02 <joanie>	i appreciate it
Aug 31 12:33:42 <alexarnaud>	If you could take a look or forward me to right list or person about a technical question on AT-SPI2 (as I understand ATK standard) : https://mail.gnome.org/archives/orca-list/2016-August/msg00017.html
Aug 31 12:33:42 <alexarnaud>	I don't know if the question is clear, if not, I could contact ksamak to have precisions. For me his message is difficult to understand.
Aug 31 12:35:12 <joanie>	alexarnaud: I'm in another meeting but I just added a sanity check for your traceback. It won't make Mouse Review work, but it should (hopefully) stop Orca from spitting up.
Aug 31 12:36:12 <alexarnaud>	I'll check, thanks you so much.

Sep 12 10:38:33 <ankh>	schoppenhauer, in theory you could use an image inside svg, but in practice I don't know if that works very well. You could have a "longdesc" attribute on the image pointing to a script that sent the appropriate transcription, or you could generate the img element itself on the fly with a server-side include
Sep 12 10:38:52 <ankh>	on Linux at least you can try orca as a reader
Sep 12 10:39:06 <schoppenhauer>	i never got orca to work properly with firefox
Sep 12 10:39:39 <schoppenhauer>	i cannot generate the img-element on the fly when I want to host the file statically
Sep 12 10:40:38 <schoppenhauer>	hm. longdesc does not really solve this problem.
Sep 12 10:44:51 <schoppenhauer>	ankh: probably a VM with vinux is the easiest to get a working orca+ff, right?
Sep 12 10:45:53 <ankh>	no idea re. vinux
Sep 12 10:46:26 <ankh>	well, you're doing some scripting to generate the random image already
Sep 12 10:47:13 <ankh>	have that script generate <img alt="..." src="data:....." />
Sep 12 10:47:27 <ankh>	watch that you can't have paragraph breaks or other markup inside alt, though
Sep 12 10:48:46 <schoppenhauer>	well then I would have to generate the whole page containing the <img>
Sep 12 10:48:51 <schoppenhauer>	which I want to host statically
Sep 12 10:52:12 <ankh>	hmm, no, most web servers i think support server-side includes
Sep 12 10:52:29 <ankh>	e.g. in apache <!--#include....-->
Sep 12 10:52:41 <ankh>	or be sucky and use an iframe :)
Sep 12 10:53:13 <schoppenhauer>	I will probably use an iframe
Sep 12 10:53:23 <schoppenhauer>	but will screenreaders then read the contents of this iframe?
Sep 12 10:54:20 <schoppenhauer>	hm. i will see soon probably …
Sep 12 10:54:24 <schoppenhauer>	if vinux works.
Sep 12 11:09:31 <ankh>	they should, just as if you had used blocking javascript to fetch image and text, or to generate the image on a canvas
Sep 12 11:09:48 <ankh>	and added alternate text inside the canvas
Sep 12 11:26:44 <schoppenhauer>	ankh: how can I tell orca to read a website?
Sep 12 11:26:58 <schoppenhauer>	ankh: in the current vinux installation it does not even read alt-texts for some images
Sep 12 11:28:20 <ankh>	i'm not sure why, maybe try valdiating the page?
Sep 12 11:28:56 <schoppenhauer>	validating?
Sep 12 11:29:19 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: I don't have time for a deep dive, but how are you reading the page?
Sep 12 11:29:26 <joanie>	are you arrowing in the content?
Sep 12 11:29:57 <schoppenhauer>	I am trying
Sep 12 11:30:15 <joanie>	is it reading other things?
Sep 12 11:30:17 <schoppenhauer>	ah. I include the svg-images via <object>. and inside the object, I have a jpeg. and inside this jpeg, I have an alt-text
Sep 12 11:30:20 <schoppenhauer>	yes
Sep 12 11:30:22 <schoppenhauer>	it just ignores the image
Sep 12 11:30:41 <joanie>	I need to look at how object elements are exposed
Sep 12 11:30:45 <joanie>	my guess is ROLE_EMBEDDED
Sep 12 11:31:02 <joanie>	which makes it look like a web app (e.g. google sheets)
Sep 12 11:31:07 <schoppenhauer>	m(
Sep 12 11:31:15 <joanie>	and Orca is not supposed to allow navigation in that
Sep 12 11:31:21 <joanie>	says a spec
Sep 12 11:31:32 <schoppenhauer>	is there anything not broken with screenreaders?
Sep 12 11:32:06 *	joanie sighs at the question
Sep 12 11:34:56 <schoppenhauer>	can I disable object-tags then?
Sep 12 11:34:57 <joanie>	negativity aside, images with alt text are normally presented by Orca. I'll add looking into <object> as time permits. But it should work with the img element.
Sep 12 11:35:00 <joanie>	is that not an option?
Sep 12 11:35:16 <schoppenhauer>	no it is not
Sep 12 11:35:17 <joanie>	disable them?
Sep 12 11:35:41 <schoppenhauer>	svg should be included using object-tags, especially since this is the only way to have a fallback jpeg
Sep 12 11:35:49 <schoppenhauer>	and this jpeg is included using img
Sep 12 11:36:06 <joanie>	ok, then I'll look into the object issue. That's the best I can do right now
Sep 12 11:36:07 <joanie>	sorry
Sep 12 11:36:14 <schoppenhauer>	I assumed that when a screenreader cannot handle the object-tag, it would use the alternative content
Sep 12 11:36:36 <schoppenhauer>	because object-tags have alternative content for that purpose I think
Sep 12 11:36:47 <joanie>	the problem (what I need to address) is that the accessible object probably looks just like a web app
Sep 12 11:37:04 <joanie>	and the W3C spec says screen readers are supposed to not consume or cause navigation in web apps
Sep 12 11:37:21 <joanie>	so I need to pull tags out of object attributes to see that it's not a web app
Sep 12 11:37:34 <joanie>	and I apologize for not realizing this needed doing
Sep 12 11:37:41 <joanie>	i'll look at it shortly
Sep 12 11:37:47 <schoppenhauer>	ok
Sep 12 11:38:10 <joanie>	you have a test case handy?
Sep 12 11:38:25 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: https://blog.uxul.de/e?e=beekeeping
Sep 12 11:38:42 <joanie>	thanks. please give me a few as I didn't really have time for this
Sep 12 11:38:48 <schoppenhauer>	ok
Sep 12 11:38:52 <schoppenhauer>	take your time.
Sep 12 11:42:56 <schoppenhauer>	maybe in the meantime I'll try jaws on a vm
Sep 12 11:43:07 <joanie>	sounds like a plan
Sep 12 11:47:51 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: I was wrong about my theory. I'm looking at this in accerciser
Sep 12 11:48:00 <joanie>	The svg has ROLE_DOCUMENT_FRAME
Sep 12 11:48:08 <joanie>	and no alt text
Sep 12 11:48:25 <joanie>	because ROLE_DOCUMENT_FRAME is not ROLE_IMAGE
Sep 12 11:48:43 <joanie>	and the accessible name of the DOCUMENT_FRAME is the url of the svg
Sep 12 11:48:57 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: so … what can I do to make it accessible?
Sep 12 11:49:23 <joanie>	I would need to play around with it. Happily this time doesn't seem to be all screen readers being broken. That's something, anyway ;)
Sep 12 11:49:23 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: it is an <object ...><img ... alt="" /></object>
Sep 12 11:49:41 <joanie>	yeah, I see a bunch of child images which lack names
Sep 12 11:49:50 <joanie>	which result from the <img ... alt="">
Sep 12 11:50:03 <schoppenhauer>	it actually has alt-text
Sep 12 11:50:10 <joanie>	what does?
Sep 12 11:50:12 <schoppenhauer>	and I would have expected the alt-text to appear 
Sep 12 11:50:13 <joanie>	the svg?
Sep 12 11:50:16 <schoppenhauer>	no, the jpeg
Sep 12 11:50:19 <schoppenhauer>	inside the object-tag
Sep 12 11:50:29 <joanie>	I'm looking at this in accerciser
Sep 12 11:59:51 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: http://picpaste.com/what-alt-text-wBmYqIfi.png
Sep 12 11:59:58 <joanie>	that's a screenshot from Accerciser
Sep 12 12:00:05 <joanie>	that is what Orca sees
Sep 12 12:00:22 <joanie>	you'll note in that image that there's another image which does have an accessible name
Sep 12 12:00:27 <joanie>	the one about hipsters
Sep 12 12:00:43 <joanie>	you'll note that the svg element has the url as the accessible name
Sep 12 12:00:50 <joanie>	and a bunch of nameless child elements
Sep 12 12:01:11 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: that is the random image. does the internal frame have another child besides the svg?
Sep 12 12:01:32 <joanie>	lemme look
Sep 12 12:03:17 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: nope the internal frame has one child: the svg
Sep 12 12:03:48 <joanie>	and the svg has 162 nameless child images
Sep 12 12:05:48 <joanie>	and JAWS and NVDA are reading this??
Sep 12 12:13:43 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: Should I anticipate a new version to examine for accessibility?
Sep 12 12:17:54 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: anticipate?
Sep 12 12:18:14 <joanie>	I set aside some things to answer your questions and see if there was something I could fix in Orca
Sep 12 12:18:18 <schoppenhauer>	(jaws is not running yet)
Sep 12 12:18:24 <joanie>	if you're about to have a new version I'll wait
Sep 12 12:18:31 <joanie>	otherwise I'll go back to other stuff
Sep 12 12:19:01 <joanie>	but from what I see in Accerciser from this version, there's nothing on my side I can do
Sep 12 12:19:06 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: it has time, maybe first do other stuff and I'll find out what other screenreaders do
Sep 12 12:19:15 <joanie>	ok
Sep 12 12:19:29 <joanie>	I'd be curious as to what NVDA does as it gets the windows version of what I get
Sep 12 12:19:35 <joanie>	and I'm not getting anything I can work with
Sep 12 13:00:29 <schoppenhauer>	joanie: ok, jaws reads it
Sep 12 13:00:48 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: does NVDA?
Sep 12 13:01:02 <joanie>	JAWS might be parsing the content from the DOM
Sep 12 13:01:18 <joanie>	i.e. as opposed to using a11y apis
Sep 12 13:08:50 <joanie>	schoppenhauer: I just dusted off a windows 10 box I have for occasional testing. NVDA with Firefox seems to skip right over the image.
Sep 12 13:09:07 <schoppenhauer>	but why :(
Sep 12 13:09:17 <joanie>	remember that screenshot?
Sep 12 13:09:21 <schoppenhauer>	yes
Sep 12 13:09:26 <schoppenhauer>	but I don't understand that
Sep 12 13:09:29 <schoppenhauer>	it makes no sense
Sep 12 13:09:31 <joanie>	like I said earlier, NVDA gets essentially the same thing Orca gets
Sep 12 13:09:39 <joanie>	it's IA2 rather than ATK/AT-SPI2
Sep 12 13:09:51 <joanie>	but the accessibility tree and exposed info tends to be the same
Sep 12 13:10:01 <joanie>	so if NVDA cannot see it, Orca probably cannot either
Sep 12 13:10:21 <joanie>	JAWS, at least years ago, wasn't getting all it's info from the accessibility tree
Sep 12 13:10:46 <joanie>	I'm guessing perhaps it still does
Sep 12 13:11:08 <joanie>	getting back to your question: I don't know why Firefox is not exposing things to Orca and NVDA in the way you would like
Sep 12 13:11:18 <joanie>	but that would be a question for them
Sep 12 13:11:27 <schoppenhauer>	ok
Sep 12 13:11:37 <joanie>	if you go to irc.mozilla.org and join #accessibility
Sep 12 13:11:41 <schoppenhauer>	people should just use edbrowse.
Sep 12 13:11:43 <schoppenhauer>	ok
Sep 12 13:11:43 <joanie>	they might know the answer
Sep 12 13:11:48 <schoppenhauer>	thx, I'll ask them.
Sep 12 13:11:53 <schoppenhauer>	(not today, but probably tomorrow)
Sep 12 13:11:58 <joanie>	sorry I could n't just fix it for you
Sep 12 13:12:08 <joanie>	but I cannot turn nothing into something ;)
Sep 12 13:12:15 <joanie>	and what I'm getting is, I'm afraid, nothing
Sep 12 13:12:40 <joanie>	if you file a bug against gecko a11y, feel free to cc me

Sep 24 13:24:34 <joanie>	ankh: and djb: I just commented on the bug
Sep 24 13:25:17 <joanie>	I'll look into the numlock not toggling issue, but KP_Enter is doing the right thing (expected by users who are blind) if NumLock is off
Sep 24 13:28:27 <djb>	joanie: great thanks!
Sep 24 13:28:50 <djb>	after you said that i checked with gtk+, and indeed, if the numlock is off, then Enter does function as a way to retrigger the reading
Sep 24 13:29:38 <joanie>	djb: and this is all documented in the Orca docs
Sep 24 13:30:00 <joanie>	which, again, no one reads docs and that sucks if you're not a "typical" screen reader user
Sep 24 13:30:08 <djb>	mea culpa
Sep 24 13:30:10 <joanie>	but like I said in the bug, I don't see changing that
Sep 24 13:30:22 <joanie>	no, it's perfectly reasonable for you to not know that
Sep 24 13:30:31 <djb>	glad i found the oddity with gnome-shell though
Sep 24 13:30:51 <joanie>	scren reader users and developers and instructors know all the secret handshakes and knocks ;)
Sep 24 13:31:21 <joanie>	Orca has to hack around other known clutter input-event exposure (or failure to expose) issues
Sep 24 13:31:48 <joanie>	so my guess is that this is another not-Orca bug which Orca should hack around but isn't
Sep 24 13:32:02 <joanie>	or that Orca's hack is getting things wrong here :-/
Sep 24 13:32:10 <joanie>	this is why sad hacks are sad
