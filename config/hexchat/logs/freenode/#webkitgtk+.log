Jul 27 07:21:45 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos, you probably want this for Ephy - https://paste.fedoraproject.org/396245/46961841/ (I'm waiting on WK compilation to actually compile this patch)..
Jul 27 07:52:52 <KaL>	tpopela: file a bug report and attach the patch, please
Jul 27 07:57:51 <tpopela>	KaL, ok, will do! btw Is rego on PTO? I'm having some difficulties regarding to accommodation for hackfest (no response from Avenida on my mail)..
Jul 27 08:00:21 <KaL>	PTO?
Jul 27 08:04:15 <tpopela>	KaL, Paid Time Off - holidays..
Jul 27 08:04:35 <KaL>	ah, I don't know, let me check
Jul 27 08:16:55 <KaL>	tpopela: yes, it seems he is going to be off for a few days
Jul 27 08:17:09 <KaL>	tpopela: maybe calvaris can help you
Jul 27 08:17:40 <tpopela>	KaL, ok and thank you! :)
Jul 27 09:21:41 <calvaris>	tpopela: I think we'll handle the reservations later
Jul 27 09:21:57 <calvaris>	is there any reasons you are in a hurry?
Jul 27 09:22:54 <tpopela>	calvaris, Hi! :) nope, I just wanted to remove it from my TODO :).. Anyway lajava talked with them and they did not receive my mail..
Jul 27 09:23:35 <tpopela>	calvaris, also you know this year I'm really looking forward to your famous octopus ;)
Jul 27 09:23:48 <calvaris>	tpopela: dude, I became vegan
Jul 27 09:23:52 <calvaris>	:D
Jul 27 09:23:57 <calvaris>	not eating it anymore
Jul 27 09:23:59 <mcatanzaro>	Plot twist!
Jul 27 09:24:01 <tpopela>	calvaris, no way :D
Jul 27 09:24:07 <calvaris>	yes way
Jul 27 09:24:39 <calvaris>	but I guess somebody else will do it instead of me
Jul 27 09:26:39 <tpopela>	calvaris, wow.. ok, then you need to prepare something vegan ;)
Jul 27 09:27:49 <calvaris>	there will be vegan options as usual
Jul 27 09:29:22 <aperezdc>	pretty much anyone from Galicia can make some octopus, or when around the region know some place where to go eat it
Jul 27 09:30:01 <aperezdc>	:)
Jul 27 09:30:02 <mcatanzaro>	"yoon: pulpo!"
Jul 27 09:31:05 <tpopela>	aperezdc, I think that you are definitely right.. I was just trying to "pay my debts" as last time I went with joanie and others to the indian place.. ;)
Jul 27 09:31:09 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, :D:D
Jul 27 09:31:19 <aperezdc>	:-)
Jul 27 09:32:27 <calvaris>	tpopela: cool, I'll go to the indian this time
Jul 27 09:36:11 <tpopela>	btw guys do you know if there is any "tourists | pedestrians | good for running/walking" path from La Coruna do Santiago de Compostela?
Jul 27 09:44:54 <aperezdc>	tpopela: there's the “Camino Inglés” → https://www.followthecamino.com/camino_tours/camino-ingles
Jul 27 09:45:18 <aperezdc>	allegedly, it's the branch of the pilgrimage walkpath to Santiago followed by the people who arrived from the North by sea
Jul 27 09:45:37 <aperezdc>	Coruña→Santiago is “only” ~75 km
Jul 27 09:47:13 <aperezdc>	tpopela: you can also make it a bit shorter by picking a bus to Betanzos (which is a nice town to visit) and starting the walk from there
Jul 27 09:48:25 <tpopela>	aperezdc, thank you! I plan to run and 75 km is fine :)..
Jul 27 09:49:40 <aperezdc>	tpopela: you're welcome! there's probably other routes, but the good thing of following the pilgrim's route is that most (if not all) of the paths should be signalled, and also it passes through historical places which one can visit, and there's usually lodging along the route if needed/wanted
Jul 27 09:52:42 <calvaris>	tpopela: wow, running
Jul 27 09:53:20 <tpopela>	aperezdc, yes that will be super handy if it will be signaled (I hate to look to the phone/map too often ;))
Jul 27 09:57:27 <aperezdc>	tpopela: just follow the shell signs → https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=camino+de+santiago+señal ;-)
Jul 27 09:58:05 <tpopela>	aperezdc, so I'm trying to find the exact map, but I manage to found just one from Ferrol (referenced from https://www.followthecamino.com/trip/camino-ingles )
Jul 27 09:58:22 <tpopela>	aperezdc, nice :)
Jul 27 09:59:43 <aperezdc>	tpopela: this is a blog+podcast of some person who made it from Coruña → http://indietravelpodcast.com/spain/walking-camino-ingles/
Jul 27 10:00:22 *	aperezdc digs a bit more
Jul 27 10:01:06 <tpopela>	aperezdc, wow this looks superb..
Jul 27 10:04:59 <aperezdc>	tpopela: i've found this as well → https://www.caminodesantiago.me/wp-content/uploads/Camino-Ingles-with-maps-22-August-2012.pdf
Jul 27 10:06:19 <aperezdc>	searching in Spanish I've found GPX tracks here: http://www.rayyrosa.com/caminoingles/mapa-y-track
Jul 27 10:06:53 <aperezdc>	tpopela: direct link to the Coruña→Santiago GPX here → http://www.rayyrosa.com/wp-content/uploads/gpx/INGLES-variante-a-coruna.gpx
Jul 27 10:08:59 <aperezdc>	tpopela: probably there's a lot more of stuff in the official website made by the regional government → http://www.caminodesantiago.gal/en/inicio
Jul 27 10:09:18 <tpopela>	aperezdc, wow thank you again! this will be really helpful!
Jul 27 10:09:25 <aperezdc>	...and I'll leave it here, betcha that's enough to get you started :D

Jul 30 17:19:39 <hux>	getting an error while trying to build gnome app using jhbuild
Jul 30 17:19:41 <hux>	http://pastebin.com/9Z7KshjG
Jul 30 17:21:43 <mcatanzaro>	hux: Any chance that harfbuzz was built with a different C++ ABI than WebKit? What distro is this?
Jul 30 17:22:14 <hux>	ubuntu 16.04
Jul 30 17:23:39 <mcatanzaro>	You built harfbuzz with jhbuild? What version of GCC?
Jul 30 17:24:00 <mcatanzaro>	Wait why am I asking about harfbuzz, it's not anywhere in your paste
Jul 30 17:24:24 <mcatanzaro>	Seriously no clue why I thought of it, hm
Jul 30 17:24:51 <hux>	i am trying to build gnome-calendar
Jul 30 17:24:56 <hux>	gcc version 5.4.0 20160609
Jul 30 17:25:38 <mcatanzaro>	hux, any chance you upgraded from an older Ubuntu, and had used jhbuild previously? If so you've probably got a mix of C++ ABIs in your jhbuild environment. If not, I have no clue. :(
Jul 30 17:26:01 <mcatanzaro>	/home/huzaifa/jhbuild/install/lib/libpangoft2-1.0.so.0: undefined reference to `FcWeightToOpenType' <-- hm, that one is different, no C++ there
Jul 30 17:27:53 <hux>	i had a failed attempt at building another gnome-app using jhbuild recently
Jul 30 17:28:36 <mcatanzaro>	hux: Is it possible that jhbuild built fontconfig but not pango? It looks you might have multiple problems here, this is strange. :(
Jul 30 17:31:33 <hux>	should i ignore this error and continue to install?
Jul 30 17:31:46 <mcatanzaro>	hux: Nope, this is pretty fatal
Jul 30 17:32:09 <mcatanzaro>	You can add skip = ['WebKit'] to your jhbuildrc and try again; I'm pretty sure gnome-calendar does not need super recent WebKit
Jul 30 17:32:31 <mcatanzaro>	But I wonder if something else is going to fail... it might be worth deleting your jhbuild install directory and starting fresh
Jul 30 17:35:25 <hux>	mcatanzaro: ok starting afresh. Thanx
Aug 03 03:39:25 <mcrha>	hi KaL et al, maybe known, I do not know, but I'm at commit 0e55b186a of a WebKit git master checkout (git-svn-id: http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk@204076) and I cannot build it, it errors at: make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/xxd.pl', needed by 'DerivedSources/WebCore/InspectorOverlayPage.h'.  Stop.
Aug 03 03:39:56 <mcrha>	any advice?
Aug 03 03:40:45 <KaL>	hmm, I haven't updated today yet, and bots are building fine, so maybe it's a clean build issue
Aug 03 03:41:46 <KaL>	mcrha: I'll update and try a clean build
Aug 03 03:42:50 <mcrha>	KaL, I had some "very" old checkout (more than a month), that failed, thus I `git clean -xfd`, reconfigured, and still got this error
Aug 03 03:45:35 <mcrha>	KaL, I see the missing xxd.pl file at /Source/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/..., thus maybe only the path is wrong, or the configuration of it failed somehow
Aug 03 05:13:41 <tpopela>	mcrha, KaL clean build succeeded here..
Aug 03 05:25:37 <mcrha>	tpopela, what is 'clean build'? the `git clean -xfd` erases everything unknown in the git checkout, then I created a build/ subfolder, entered it and called `cmake ...`, then `make`. The build cannot be cleaner, I'm afraid.
Aug 03 05:27:04 <tpopela>	mcrha, clean build means cloning a git WebKit repo on a different machine, running Tools/Scripts/webkitgtk-update-libs and then running build-webkit --gtk --release
Aug 03 05:27:25 <tpopela>	mcrha, did you rm -rf WebKitBuild/Release ?
Aug 03 05:28:09 <mcrha>	tpopela, where is that directory, I do not have it in the WebKit root checkout
Aug 03 05:29:02 <tpopela>	mcrha, it is in the root checkout.. but only if you are using the WebKit build scripts (which you should use anyway (as I told you several times))..
Aug 03 05:29:49 <annulen>	mcrha: it's a default build dir of build-webkit, can be changed with WEBKIT_OUTPUTDIR variable
Aug 03 05:31:08 <mcrha>	okay, I do not have it, I call cmake manually, not through the "preferred way of building webkit"
Aug 03 05:32:19 <mcrha>	if I: `cp ../Source/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/* DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/`, then it starts building
Aug 03 05:32:45 <mcrha>	maybe the build-webkit does that in some way in the background; searching...
Aug 03 05:34:04 <mcrha>	ehm, `cp -r` is needed
Aug 03 05:34:17 <mcrha>	or not
Aug 03 05:34:34 <mcrha>	make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/builtins.py', needed by 'DerivedSources/WebCore/DOMWindowFetchBuiltins.cpp'.  Stop.
Aug 03 05:36:50 *	annulen never realized that Scripts get copied to ForwardingHeaders, that's amazing
Aug 03 05:38:49 <mcrha>	tpopela, do I checkout wrong branch?$ ls Tools/Scripts/webkitgtk-update-libs
Aug 03 05:38:49 <mcrha>	ls: cannot access 'Tools/Scripts/webkitgtk-update-libs': No such file or directory
Aug 03 05:39:12 <mcrha>	staying at git checkout root, of course
Aug 03 05:39:26 <tpopela>	mcrha, probably it is update-webkitgtk-libs
Aug 03 05:39:51 <mcrha>	right, that's there
Aug 03 05:40:26 <mcrha>	ble, jhbuild
Aug 03 06:22:45 <mcrha>	nah, it's all weird. I can `cmake ... && make stageSharedScripts && make`, but it fails later at:

Aug 03 06:36:09 <mcrha>	that will be something on my machine for sure, never mind and I'm sorry for bothering you with my own fault :-/

Aug 11 06:57:02 <CrazyLemon>	hey guys... does this look like webkitgtk bug https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/245 ?
Aug 11 06:59:21 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: Hrm. How much video memory do you have?
Aug 11 07:00:10 <CrazyLemon>	mrobinson well i have 7.4GB available ram..so integrated graphics is taking 512MB+ ?
Aug 11 07:00:20 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: Hrm.
Aug 11 07:00:45 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: It seems that even if you run out of video memory, your system shouldn't freeze...
Aug 11 07:01:00 <philn>	mrobinson: might be the IPC issues Carlos fixed recently?
Aug 11 07:01:17 <mrobinson>	philn: Do you have a link to those?
Aug 11 07:02:19 <philn>	i'd need to search in the git log
Aug 11 07:02:28 <CrazyLemon>	yea.. the freeze part is super annoying
Aug 11 07:02:43 <CrazyLemon>	SSH works but not really helpful since i can't kill webkit process
Aug 11 07:03:52 <annulen>	why?
Aug 11 07:04:30 <CrazyLemon>	process is/gets (?) defunct
Aug 11 07:05:31 <annulen>	kill -9?
Aug 11 07:05:39 <philn>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152316
Aug 11 07:05:52 <CrazyLemon>	-9 doesnt help..as i said you can't kill it :D
Aug 11 07:05:55 <CrazyLemon>	its a zombie process
Aug 11 07:08:14 <philn>	seems like a graphics driver issue, the patch i link above is more about fixing "too many files open" issues
Aug 11 07:11:26 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: Any sort of driver log could be helpful.
Aug 11 07:12:46 <CrazyLemon>	mrobinson i really hate freezing my system :D but yea..i'll give it a go and ssh into it a see what dmesg says about radeon
Aug 11 07:14:11 <CrazyLemon>	is this of any help https://paste.ubuntu.com/23013769/ ? this is currently in my dmesg
Aug 11 07:15:27 <annulen>	changing log level of kernel might help
Aug 11 07:16:38 <CrazyLemon>	so..level 8?
Aug 11 07:31:55 <CrazyLemon>	https://paste.ubuntu.com/23014217/ mrobinson is this helpful?
Aug 11 07:32:45 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: Does seem to be memory related somehow.
Aug 11 07:32:55 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: You don't see that at other times, do you?
Aug 11 07:33:19 <CrazyLemon>	mrobinson this is the first time i saw that msg
Aug 11 07:33:38 <CrazyLemon>	maybe had something to do with log level
Aug 11 07:34:42 <CrazyLemon>	but i have no issues other that with nuvola player/minibrowser & soundcloud
Aug 11 07:34:52 <CrazyLemon>	than*
Aug 11 08:45:26 <annulen>	by chance, is anybody aware of FTL crash fixes that are missing in 2.12 branch?

Aug 19 12:11:16 <JakeSays>	aperezdc: hey thanks!
Aug 19 13:25:11 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Somebody is complaining about a laggy WebKitWebView inside the GOA panel: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1367894
Aug 19 13:25:21 <rishi>	Have you seen this before?
Aug 19 13:25:23 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: Probably DRI3 + modesetting driver
Aug 19 13:25:35 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85064
Aug 19 13:25:41 <rishi>	Oh, right. I forgot about that.
Aug 19 13:25:42 <mcatanzaro>	There's a workaround in WebKitGTK+ 2.14
Aug 19 13:26:11 <rishi>	Do we enable DRI3 in Fedora?
Aug 19 13:26:14 *	rishi opens the bug
Aug 19 13:26:22 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: Yes, in some post-release F23 update
Aug 19 13:26:34 <annulen>	does 2.14 branch exist already?
Aug 19 13:28:26 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: I don't think so, no
Aug 19 13:28:54 <mcatanzaro>	It's (very slightly) late, probably KaL is busy. We've had no bugfix release since May either.
Aug 19 13:30:08 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: git grep LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE <- doesn't give me any hits. Tried both epiphany:f23 and epiphany:gnome-3-18. Makes me wonder why Ephy works fine with DDG.
Aug 19 13:30:16 <rishi>	Or did you mean F24 when you said "post-release F23 update"?
Aug 19 13:30:27 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: You are using the intel driver, this user is using the modesetting driver
Aug 19 13:30:40 <mcatanzaro>	I removed the LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE workaround some time after the Intel driver was fixed
Aug 19 13:30:52 <mcatanzaro>	Then after that, Fedora enabled the modesetting driver for some users with newer hardware
Aug 19 13:31:13 <rishi>	I see, ok.
Aug 19 13:31:29 <mcatanzaro>	At the time of that change, I complained that it would break WebKit, but nobody cared
Aug 19 13:31:34 *	mcatanzaro shrugs
Aug 19 13:31:48 <rishi>	I don't know the difference between modesetting and Intel drivers, except that the later is possibly used for Intel hardware. :)
Aug 19 13:32:06 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: KaL found the workaround after he noticed that in 2.14 *every* page was affected
Aug 19 13:32:27 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: I don't understand it either, but the intel driver is apparently obsolete
Aug 19 13:33:19 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Yes, I remember. I am CCed on the bug. I paged it out since my F23 systems were unaffected.
Aug 19 13:42:19 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Thanks.

Aug 19 21:38:02 <MonkeyofDoom>	which LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE seems to help (webkit2gtk 2.12.3 here, building 2.13.4 presently)
Aug 19 23:48:24 <MonkeyofDoom>	yeah, 2.13.4 is 1fps scrolling on all pages w/o the env var
Aug 21 10:39:08 <Joao>	hey guys, was the create-plugin-widget signal really removed from webkit2gtk?
Aug 21 12:35:28 <Joao>	in that case, how can one embed a gtk widget into a webkitview?
Aug 21 23:43:56 <Joao>	and why don't widgets as object/embed cause the application to fail when the width is set to 100% of the container element?
Aug 21 23:44:45 <Joao>	the error reads something like: " Gdk-ERROR **: The program 'XXXXX' received an X Window System error. / This probably reflects a bug in the program. / The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'. /(Details: serial 1468258 error_code 11 request_code 53 (core protocol) minor_code 0) and more...
Aug 21 23:45:11 <Joao>	sorry, I meant height
Aug 21 23:45:15 <Joao>	width works like a charm
Aug 21 23:45:20 <Joao>	height is the one that screws it all
Aug 21 23:45:51 <Joao>	if I remove "height: 100%", it works, but can't get it to vertically auto-resize to the available space
Aug 21 23:47:04 <Joao>	and stranger even
Aug 21 23:47:10 <Joao>	I can resize the window to grow
Aug 21 23:47:18 <Joao>	but it doesn't allow me to shrink it
Aug 21 23:47:21 <Joao>	(with the mouse, I mean)
Aug 21 23:54:16 <MonkeyofDoom>	create-plugin-widget seems like it would have significant and confusing interaction with multiprocess architecture
Aug 21 23:54:21 <MonkeyofDoom>	as a reason for why it was removed
Aug 22 10:58:59 <garnacho_>	KaL: ping? I think you're a right guy to talk about wayland issues? :)
Aug 22 11:09:42 <KaL>	garnacho_: I'm back
Aug 22 11:11:25 <garnacho_>	KaL: hey :), I'm realizing mcatanzaro might be best, I had a look into the clipboard issues, and just found https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146574
Aug 22 11:11:42 <mcatanzaro>	Hi garnacho_
Aug 22 11:11:47 <KaL>	garnacho_: indeed, I'm only working on accelerated compositing stuff
Aug 22 11:12:28 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: oh! last time I tried to autocomplete you didn't seem to be here :)
Aug 22 11:12:53 <garnacho_>	KaL: nevermind then :)
Aug 22 11:14:15 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: so, reading that last comment, what was your approach to fixing this? I came to think that only proxying clipboard content to the ui process could work...
Aug 22 11:17:02 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: That's exactly what I'm trying. If you're interested in working on it, I haven't gotten very far; I have just a little work done on vacation a month or so ago
Aug 22 11:17:55 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: We already have cross-platform code for proxying clipboard content as it's how it works on macOS and iOS, but we have to reverse the logic in the GTK-specific files to use it
Aug 22 11:20:54 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: right, is it this PasteboardHelper I'm seeing? you already seem to do this to some extent for DnD
Aug 22 11:21:26 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: Yes. Which reminds me, trying to do DnD just causes the web process to crash :)
Aug 22 11:22:37 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: I just left another comment on the bug with a couple hints
Aug 22 11:23:33 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: thanks :). I'm jumping into vacation sometime this week, but nonetheless I think would be great to have this fixed for 3.22, might take time till I get to it, but I eventually will
Aug 22 11:24:12 <mcatanzaro>	yaaaaay :D
Aug 22 17:16:17 <Joao>	so, guys, any idea why I cannot reduce a window which has as only child a webkitgtk control?
Aug 24 04:00:32 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to KaL
Aug 24 04:00:43 *	KaL has changed the topic to: WebKitGTK+ stable: 2.12.4, unstable: 2.13.4 | Homepage: http://webkitgtk.org/ | http://ews-watcher.kov.eti.br/ |  http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTK/2.10.x | http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTK/2.12.x | "HTML is useful for a web content rendering engine.

Aug 24 04:14:03 <blino>	magomez: hi, did you have time to get a look at bug 159928 ? (WebGL GPU-GPU copy)
Aug 24 04:14:37 <magomez>	not yet blino, but I'll try to do it this week
Aug 24 04:21:57 <blino>	great, thanks
Aug 24 16:32:28 <xjuan>	hello guys, is it possible to access a file url from a custom url scheme registered with webkit_web_context_register_uri_scheme() ?
Aug 24 16:32:52 <xjuan>	Received an unexpected URL from the web process: 'file://local.html/'
Aug 24 16:32:54 <xjuan>	Received an invalid message "WebPageProxy.DecidePolicyForNavigationAction" from the web process.
Aug 24 16:33:03 <xjuan>	that the error I get when I try to do so
Aug 24 16:58:27 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: You might have to try different security settings
Aug 24 16:58:53 <mcatanzaro>	There is an AllowUniversalAccessToFileURIs setting; if your app doesn't display any untrusted content, that might be the easiest solution
Aug 24 17:01:03 <xjuan>	ohh nice
Aug 24 17:01:12 <xjuan>	btw this is my test case in JS http://pastebin.com/yh3JNEbV
Aug 24 17:01:26 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: Try https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/unstable/WebKitSecurityManager.html#webkit-security-manager-register-uri-scheme-as-local
Aug 24 17:01:53 <xjuan>	I did, and that is when I get those errors
Aug 24 17:01:54 <mcatanzaro>	Unless you need to use that URI scheme from non-local pages, then it definitely won't work
Aug 24 17:02:12 <mcatanzaro>	Ah, you've already looked into this more than me, sorry. :(
Aug 24 17:02:18 <xjuan>	no the new scheme is local
Aug 24 17:02:47 <xjuan>	nono I am a webkitgtk newby so any help is much appreciated
Aug 24 17:03:20 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: Try flipping https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitSettings.html#WebKitSettings--allow-file-access-from-file-urls as well (though note that's definitely not secure if you allow loading arbitrary file URLs)
Aug 24 17:04:01 <mcatanzaro>	You can also try asking here earlier in the day, when European folks are active; more likely to get a response then. Worst case, it's not possible and requires new API....
Aug 24 17:04:22 <xjuan>	yeah I tried that one too
Aug 24 17:09:36 <xjuan>	mcatanzaro: thanks! I will ask tomorrow morning
Aug 24 19:04:50 <memeka>	Hi, does webkit2gtk uses gstreamer?
Aug 24 19:05:01 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Yes!
Aug 24 19:05:27 <memeka>	The system one or bundled?
Aug 24 19:05:36 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: System!
Aug 24 19:05:57 <memeka>	Decodebin?
Aug 24 19:06:14 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: I don't know!
Aug 24 19:06:37 <memeka>	I get YouTube crashing after the first frame in epiphany 3.20
Aug 24 19:07:21 <memeka>	Default decoder is v4l2 (hw accelerated exynos mfc)
Aug 24 19:07:36 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: That's sad, it works for me on Fedora 24 with WebKitGTK+ 2.12.3 and GStreamer 1.8.3
Aug 24 19:08:03 <mcatanzaro>	If you get a backtrace, then you can file a bug (bugzilla.webkit.org if you think it's a WebKit bug, bugzilla.gnome.org if you think it's a GStreamer bug)
Aug 24 19:08:28 <memeka>	I am assuming it's the decoder not the presentation
Aug 24 19:08:29 <mcatanzaro>	The GStreamer backend code is in Source/WebCore/platform/graphics/gstreamer if you're curious.
Aug 24 19:08:39 <memeka>	Although gst plays correctly
Aug 24 19:09:00 <memeka>	How can I get a trace of gst events?
Aug 24 19:13:21 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: I don't know! I think there is an environment variable. GST_TRACE? GST_DEBUG?
Aug 24 19:13:35 <memeka>	yes i think so, thx!
Aug 24 19:51:21 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: any idea why webGL in wayland is slow?
Aug 24 19:51:39 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: I didn't realize WebGL worked in Wayland!
Aug 24 19:52:21 <memeka>	well, chrome has a chrome://gpu page which shows all gpu details (including EGL extensions)
Aug 24 19:52:37 <memeka>	i could not find anything similar in webkit/epiphany
Aug 24 19:52:50 <mcatanzaro>	I don't think we have anything similar. Sounds like a cool thing to have!
Aug 24 19:53:07 <memeka>	but on a webgl info page, it showed it's compatible with webgl
Aug 24 19:53:16 <memeka>	and showed my GPU string
Aug 24 19:53:21 <memeka>	as opposed to MESA
Aug 24 19:53:28 <mcatanzaro>	I believe you, I just didn't know it was done!
Aug 24 19:53:35 <memeka>	(chrome in xwayland uses llvm mesa)
Aug 24 19:53:47 <memeka>	HOWEVER, webgl stuff is very slow
Aug 24 19:53:52 <memeka>	2-3 fps :)
Aug 24 19:54:08 <memeka>	so maybe it's not done :)
Aug 24 19:54:18 <memeka>	or at least, it's not zero-copy?
Aug 24 19:54:25 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Try running with LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE=1, does that help? If so it's fixed in this morning's release
Aug 24 19:58:42 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23086809/
Aug 24 19:59:08 <memeka>	so i think you were right, webgl is not working :) at least not accelerated :P
Aug 24 19:59:17 <memeka>	Major Performance Caveat:	Not implemented
Aug 24 19:59:19 <memeka>	:)
Aug 24 20:00:02 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder what's not implemented....
Aug 24 20:00:30 <memeka>	it gets the correct vendor, GL version, renderer etc
Aug 24 20:00:44 <memeka>	so it does read libEGL and libGLES
Aug 24 20:00:55 <memeka>	or at least gets them from wayland
Aug 24 20:10:33 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: yay now gstreamer HW decoder is being used
Aug 24 20:10:47 <memeka>	but the video is still not very fluid, i think it's the presentation layer?
Aug 24 20:13:04 <memeka>	either that, or it's scaling done in SW
Aug 25 03:09:25 <keis>	is there some way to get webkit_web_view_run_javascript to return a better error message?
Aug 25 03:10:17 <keis>	it only tells me "An exception was raised in JavaScript" which is not very helpful
Aug 25 03:40:16 <KaL>	keis: yes, we could expose the exception details parameter that we are currently ignoring, please file a bug report
Aug 25 04:02:30 <keis>	KaL: will do
Aug 25 04:02:40 <keis>	are you using the gnome bugzilla?
Aug 25 04:02:50 <KaL>	nope, webkit bugzilla
Aug 25 04:02:53 <keis>	kk
Aug 25 04:03:15 <KaL>	bugs.webkit.org WebKitGtk component
Aug 25 04:09:41 <keis>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161187
Aug 25 04:10:14 <keis>	also found that `window.location` fails like that while `""+window.location` works fine
Aug 25 04:10:22 <keis>	should I open a bug for that too?
Aug 25 04:20:58 <KaL>	sure
Aug 25 09:54:54 <xjuan>	morning guys
Aug 25 09:55:33 <xjuan>	I get the folowing error when I try to open a file:// scheme from a custom scheme like new://
Aug 25 09:55:41 <xjuan>	Received an unexpected URL from the web process: 'file://local.html/'
Aug 25 09:55:43 <xjuan>	Received an invalid message "WebPageProxy.DecidePolicyForNavigationAction" from the web process.
Aug 25 09:56:14 <xjuan>	http://pastebin.com/yh3JNEbV is a simple test case in JS

Aug 25 11:34:56 <KaL>	xjuan: that sounds like mixing different versions of UI and web process
Aug 25 11:35:59 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: No, it sounds like no sandbox extension was taken
Aug 25 11:36:29 <mcatanzaro>	The UI process just refuses to load file URLs from the web process if it hasn't seen them before, unless you change (something)
Aug 25 11:36:30 <KaL>	it's complaining about an invalid message
Aug 25 11:36:57 <KaL>	that could explain the unexpected URL not the invalid message
Aug 25 11:37:11 <mcatanzaro>	Hm
Aug 25 11:39:46 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: I just tried your test case and I'm not seeing those errors, actually
Aug 25 11:40:17 <mcatanzaro>	When I click the middle URL it prints:
Aug 25 11:40:19 <mcatanzaro>	decide-policy: new://local.html

Aug 25 11:40:23 <mcatanzaro>	decide-policy: new://local.html
Aug 25 11:41:50 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: I think the description for our https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/unstable/WebKitSettings.html#WebKitSettings--allow-universal-access-from-file-urls is outdated now, right? You can access local storage regardless of whether the setting is set now in 2.12.4, right?
Aug 25 11:43:04 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: nope, the description is the same
Aug 25 11:43:32 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: ah, well, the local storage part
Aug 25 11:49:02 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: The local storage part!
Aug 25 11:52:59 <KaL>	right, we can probably just omit that part
Aug 25 12:05:29 <xjuan>	mcatanzaro: sorry I was having lunch
Aug 25 12:06:55 <xjuan>	mcatanzaro: you get "CONSOLE ERROR Not allowed to load local resource: file:///home/xjuan/local.html" right?
Aug 25 12:07:06 <mcatanzaro>	No xjuan, I do not
Aug 25 12:07:16 <mcatanzaro>	What version of WebKitGTK+ do you have?
Aug 25 12:08:27 <xjuan>	pkg-config --modversion webkit2gtk-4.0
Aug 25 12:08:30 <xjuan>	2.12.3
Aug 25 12:08:34 <mcatanzaro>	Same as me
Aug 25 12:08:40 <xjuan>	using debian sid here
Aug 25 12:09:27 <xjuan>	btw I get the "Received an unexpected URL" error when I register the new scheme as local

Aug 29 11:47:29 <JeanLuc__>	hi, has anyone tested WebKit.WebView.load_html with a base_uri other than 'null' with the freshly released version 2.14.4?
Aug 29 11:47:56 <JeanLuc__>	sadly the webview is broken for me since the update =/
Aug 29 11:51:17 <KaL>	what does broken mean?
Aug 29 11:52:45 <JeanLuc__>	this is how it looks now: http://imgur.com/gallery/ZDqFs
Aug 29 11:53:17 <JeanLuc__>	and a picture with base_uri = 'null' to compare
Aug 29 11:53:43 <JeanLuc__>	both images and text used to work with base_uri = '/some/path'
Aug 29 11:54:57 <KaL>	I guess fonts are blocked by csp or something like that
Aug 29 11:55:24 <KaL>	or cross-origin checks
Aug 29 11:56:22 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: if you file a bug report with a simple test case in C to try, I can try to bisect to find the commit
Aug 29 11:56:24 <JeanLuc__>	csp? is there a workaround? is there anything I can do in my code (other than not using base_uri, which is kind of a deal-breaker for me)?
Aug 29 11:56:44 <JeanLuc__>	never written anything gobject in c =/
Aug 29 11:57:42 <JeanLuc__>	does generated c-code from vala work for you in this case?
Aug 29 12:01:23 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: as long as it builds it's fine
Aug 29 12:01:50 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: if there's a regression, I'll fix it and make a new release
Aug 29 12:12:30 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: could you open the inspector and check if there's any error in the js console?
Aug 29 12:29:47 <JeanLuc__>	KaL: how do i open the inspector?
Aug 29 12:29:57 <JeanLuc__>	KaL: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161313
Aug 29 12:30:26 <KaL>	right click, open inspector, you need to enable developer extras setting first
Aug 29 12:32:42 <JeanLuc__>	opened the insector, further instructions? :D
Aug 29 12:43:39 <KaL>	check the console
Aug 29 12:53:28 <JeanLuc__>	KaL: only a blue box with "Selected Element" and then the html-element that I selected below
Aug 29 12:53:42 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: in you exampole you are using literally file://some/path/
Aug 29 12:54:03 <KaL>	fonts in the article are using relative paths
Aug 29 12:54:17 <KaL>	and of course  file://some/path/assets/whateverfont
Aug 29 12:54:21 <KaL>	doesn't exists
Aug 29 12:58:11 <JeanLuc__>	KaL, totally forgot about the fonts (a webdesigner wrote the css for me), I will fix the css and close the bugs. Any idea why it worked before when it actually shuldn't? oO
Aug 29 12:59:50 <KaL>	no idea, I guess a security fix made the thing more strict
Aug 29 13:00:27 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: but, where are those fonts supposed to be located?
Aug 29 13:00:48 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: when using null those are ignored, I think, and fallbacks are probably used
Aug 29 13:00:55 <KaL>	that's why itworks
Aug 29 13:01:22 <JeanLuc__>	OOOkay :D, well big thank you for your time. I will fix it and close the bugs as soon as I'm done.
Aug 29 13:01:50 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: the thing is that if those are supposed to be local, then you should indeed use a base uri
Aug 29 13:01:59 <JeanLuc__>	no that's no what I meant, before 2.12.4 it used to work even with random base_uri paths
Aug 29 13:02:36 <KaL>	using random base_uri paths doesn't make any sense
Aug 29 13:02:54 <KaL>	if you don't load any local resource then simply use null
Aug 29 13:03:05 <JeanLuc__>	well, the path to where the images were stored, but not the fonts
Aug 29 13:03:08 <KaL>	and about:blank is automatically used as the base uri
Aug 29 13:03:18 <KaL>	ah
Aug 29 13:03:23 <KaL>	ok
Aug 29 13:05:06 <JeanLuc__>	Is there a way to have to locations from where resources can be loaded? The fonts are installed with the package (so most likely /usr/share/) but the images of the articles are downloaded into $HOME/.local/share/ of the user
Aug 29 13:05:22 <JeanLuc__>	... to have TWO locations ...
Aug 29 18:54:00 <brrian>	Hi folks. I am adding a derived sources phase to WebInspectorUI.
Aug 29 18:54:24 <brrian>	I think I can figure out the CMake needed, but just a heads up.
Aug 29 18:55:05 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: What could possibly go wrong! (sarcasm)
Aug 29 18:55:21 <mcatanzaro>	Good luck; if you can't make it work, we'll try to fix it tomorrow
Aug 29 18:55:35 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: I even have a VM :)
Aug 29 18:56:44 <brrian>	planning to move more of our messy perl script into actual build files now that Windows VS project is irrelevant
Aug 29 18:59:41 *	mcatanzaro can barely ready our Perl scripts
Aug 30 00:13:40 <memeka>	hi; what are the sinks used for video in wayland?
Aug 30 00:48:43 <memeka>	anyone?
Aug 30 02:41:45 <philn>	memeka: there's an internal video sink
Aug 30 02:42:08 <memeka>	philn: and that one is not EGL is it :(
Aug 30 02:42:11 <philn>	doesn't depend on the windowing protocol
Aug 30 02:42:22 <memeka>	it's very slow on wayland
Aug 30 02:42:40 <philn>	yep
Aug 30 02:42:41 <memeka>	is there a way to use the opengl sink (from gst-plugins-bad) ?
Aug 30 02:42:47 <philn>	yep
Aug 30 02:42:51 <memeka>	how? :D
Aug 30 02:43:31 <philn>	you would need to rebuild webkitgtk, setting the USE_GSTREAMER_GL option to ON
Aug 30 02:43:51 <philn>	it's disabled by default for now
Aug 30 02:46:19 <memeka>	philn: any plans to turn it on soon?
Aug 30 02:46:46 <philn>	it's declared in Source/cmake/OptionsGTK.cmake but i forgot how enable it without editing that file :)
Aug 30 02:47:23 <philn>	there's no date set in stone for the switch
Aug 30 02:49:11 <memeka>	philn: thx
Aug 30 02:49:17 <memeka>	i'll try to recompile
Aug 30 02:52:35 <memeka>	philn: it's gonna use the opengl sink from the system's gst, right? if it works with gst-launch-1.0 it should work in epiphany too ...
Aug 30 02:53:18 <philn>	memeka: not exactly, if you're building trunk we use an appsink there for GL video rendering
Aug 30 02:53:19 <memeka>	there;s also a gtksink, it's not gonna use that one, issit?
Aug 30 02:53:33 <philn>	but it's similar in behavior to glimagesink
Aug 30 02:53:47 <memeka>	not on my system :-S
Aug 30 02:54:16 <philn>	i mean the GL appsink is enabled if USE_GSTREAMER_GL is on
Aug 30 02:54:27 <memeka>	yes of course
Aug 30 02:54:30 <memeka>	just wanted to make sure
Aug 30 02:54:37 <memeka>	what sink exactly is gonna be used
Aug 30 02:54:43 <memeka>	gtksink, or glimagesink
Aug 30 02:54:53 <philn>	neither :)
Aug 30 02:55:02 <memeka>	(what's USE_GSTREAMER_MPEGTS?)
Aug 30 02:55:24 <memeka>	philn: where's the code then for this neither sink? :)
Aug 30 02:55:51 <philn>	the MPEGTS option is used for <track> element support iirc
Aug 30 02:56:04 <memeka>	platform/graphics/gstreamer/MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer.cpp ?
Aug 30 02:56:17 <philn>	MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase.cpp
Aug 30 02:56:32 <philn>	look for GSTREAMER_GL there
Aug 30 02:57:56 <memeka>	k, i see EGL and Wayland there :D
Aug 30 02:58:41 <memeka>	do i need to make sure COORDINATED_GRAPHICS_THREADED it's also ON?
Aug 30 02:59:35 <memeka>	looks like it's on based on ENABLE_OPENGL
Aug 30 03:00:28 <philn>	humm yes it might be needed
Aug 30 03:00:40 <memeka>	i saw it depends on ENABLE_OPENGL
Aug 30 03:00:48 <philn>	but i'm not sure the threaded compositor works under Wayland
Aug 30 03:00:53 <memeka>	and ENABLE_OPENGL depends on USE_GSTREAMER_GL
Aug 30 03:01:03 <memeka>	hm
Aug 30 03:01:17 <philn>	that's ok memeka, ENABLE_OPENGL is the general option for GL which includes EGL
Aug 30 03:01:47 <philn>	yoon: what's the status of threaded compositor in Wayland?
Aug 30 03:02:20 <philn>	perhaps KaL knows too :)
Aug 30 03:02:49 <memeka>	i'll wait until i start compiling then :) takes 7-8 hours on my system
Aug 30 03:06:40 <KaL>	philn: threaded compositor is now the default in both X11 and wayland
Aug 30 03:06:53 <memeka>	yay
Aug 30 03:07:05 <philn>	memeka: see you in 8 hours
Aug 30 03:07:09 <philn>	:)
Aug 30 03:07:26 <memeka>	KaL: is it good in webkit2gtk-2.12.3 ?
Aug 30 03:07:42 <memeka>	that's the one i has currently
Aug 30 03:07:50 <KaL>	no, it's current trunk that will be 2.14 in couple of months
Aug 30 03:08:05 <philn>	i'm not sure 2.12.3 has the latest appsink GL changes
Aug 30 03:08:11 <KaL>	or even earlier I don't remember the schedule :-P
Aug 30 03:08:20 <KaL>	no, I didn't merge those
Aug 30 03:08:47 <philn>	memeka: if you could try a trunk snapshot it would be better then
Aug 30 03:08:54 <memeka>	of course
Aug 30 03:09:23 <KaL>	current trunk doesn't build, give me some minutes to fix it
Aug 30 03:11:56 <memeka>	waiting to  svn checkout https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk WebKit2 :)
Aug 30 03:11:58 <foser>	KaL: schedule is in weeks i think? if it follows gnome release.. not sure if the new epiphany hard deps on 2.13
Aug 30 03:12:26 <memeka>	well, i will be using the ubuntu receipe to build it
Aug 30 03:12:33 <KaL>	foser: right, weeks :-)
Aug 30 03:12:43 <memeka>	so it will be seen as 2.12.3 :)
Aug 30 03:18:11 <memeka>	KaL: let me know when i can checkout
Aug 30 03:36:55 <KaL>	memeka: build is now fixed
Aug 30 03:38:36 <memeka>	KaL: thx, checking out now
Aug 30 03:38:54 <memeka>	i'll be back in many hours, compiling on ARM is not that fast :P
Aug 30 03:39:37 <philn>	memeka: you should cross-compile :)
Aug 30 03:39:44 <memeka>	naah
Aug 30 03:40:06 <memeka>	8 cores is reasonably fast
Aug 30 03:40:30 <memeka>	actually let's call them 4
Aug 30 03:40:48 <memeka>	cause 4 are stupid, and do more harm in using up the RAM
Aug 30 03:40:52 <memeka>	:)

Aug 30 13:04:58 <brrian>	how to clean just derived sources for one project?
Aug 30 13:40:12 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: For one subdirectory? You can try deleting just that directory manually; I think it should work
Aug 30 13:40:23 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: ok
Aug 30 13:40:33 <mcatanzaro>	e.g. WebKitBuild/Debug/
Aug 30 13:40:48 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: I'm making a separate CMakeLists.txt for WebInspectorUI, which at a minimum has the new derived sources generation command and a shared list of resources
Aug 30 13:40:59 <mcatanzaro>	Sorry, delete WebKitBuild/Debug/WebInspectorUI and I *think* they should be regenerated properly, rebuilding only the minimum number of things required
Aug 30 13:41:04 <brrian>	every CMake port seems to do something different with the files, so that stuff will be in the .cmake files
Aug 30 13:41:17 <brrian>	k
Aug 30 13:41:33 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: #webkit would probably be a better place to discuss this since all CMake folks will be there (e.g. alexchristensen)
Aug 30 13:41:40 <brrian>	yeah he's aware
Aug 30 13:41:50 <brrian>	apparently EFL runs its own minifier o_O
Aug 30 13:41:53 <brrian>	that could backfire
Aug 30 13:42:09 <mcatanzaro>	Just for the web inspector...?
Aug 30 13:42:12 <brrian>	well
Aug 30 13:42:15 <brrian>	UglifyJS
Aug 30 13:42:28 <brrian>	for Make based ports we run a perl script that minifies and combines stuff
Aug 30 13:42:41 <mcatanzaro>	Is minification really useful for the web inspector?
Aug 30 13:42:53 <brrian>	concatenation is way more important
Aug 30 13:43:07 <brrian>	otherwise WebCore has to spin through ~400 resource loads before showing anything
Aug 30 13:43:31 <brrian>	but minifying helps reduce parse times a little bit. on Mac we use a very simple minifier, no renaming or anything.
Aug 30 13:44:17 <brrian>	I don't know what the GResource stuff does, but if you want to improve load times it should be pretty easy to copy or reuse the perl script
Aug 30 13:47:35 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: It puts all the data inside the binary itself, in some fancy ELF location
Aug 30 13:47:43 <brrian>	ah I see
Aug 30 13:47:45 <mcatanzaro>	So there is no file opening
Aug 30 13:47:58 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: If you're curious: https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2012/01/26/resources-in-glib/
Aug 30 13:48:01 <brrian>	sure, but it still has to go through the network loader
Aug 30 13:48:26 <annulen>	brrian: are you talking about WebInspectorUI/Scripts/copy-user-interface-resources.pl? There is yet another script doing similar thing, JavaScriptCore/Scripts/inline-and-minify-stylesheets-and-scripts.py
Aug 30 13:48:37 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: nice link!
Aug 30 13:48:47 <brrian>	annulen: yeah, I'm starting to break that script up a bit
Aug 30 13:48:52 <annulen>	cool
Aug 30 13:48:59 <annulen>	I was tempted to use it in Qt
Aug 30 13:49:09 <brrian>	annulen: only Mac uses it afaik
Aug 30 13:49:17 <brrian>	I'm consolidating some CMake stuff
Aug 30 13:49:41 <annulen>	I know, and anyone trying to refactor it on pther platform will necessary break Mac things :)
Aug 30 13:50:31 <brrian>	heh
Aug 30 13:50:47 <brrian>	well most of what it does is easy enough to do in CMake or Make
Aug 30 13:51:00 <brrian>	and way easier to maintain
Aug 30 13:51:02 <brrian>	that way
Aug 30 13:53:10 <brrian>	annulen: pretty much all of the minification/combining should be independent of the port-specific resource packaging system.. the input is either a few combined files or a few hundred files from source
Aug 30 13:53:57 <annulen>	fully agree, if it doesn't require installing nodejs, like EFL approach :)
Aug 30 13:54:05 <brrian>	yeah, that's a nonstarter for us
Aug 30 13:54:13 <brrian>	and our minifier is much simpler little python script
Aug 30 13:54:42 <brrian>	btw, is there some rhyme or reason to using ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/Source/WebInspectorUI/... vs ${WEBINSPECTORUI_DIR}/...
Aug 30 13:55:02 <brrian>	the latter seems better, except SOURCES lists don't use prefixes usually
Aug 30 13:55:25 <mcatanzaro>	Probably no rhyme or reason, should probably standardize on WEBINSPECTORUI_DIR
Aug 30 13:55:30 <brrian>	k
Aug 30 13:56:31 <brrian>	another interesting difference is that on Mac, DerivedSources is usually flattened, whereas with CMake it seems to parallel the source layout
Aug 30 13:57:59 <brrian>	ugh.. is there some magic to make ubuntu have emacs line-oriented keybindings everywhere/ :P
Aug 30 13:58:42 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: There is a GTK+ setting for that actually... somewhere...
Aug 30 13:58:51 <brrian>	looks like
Aug 30 13:58:56 <brrian>	gnome-tweak-tools or something
Aug 30 13:59:00 <annulen>	one possible problem with minification: you have to inline everything into both Main.html and Test,html
Aug 30 13:59:21 <annulen>	so it becomes important to get rid of Test.html in production build
Aug 30 13:59:22 <brrian>	annulen: that's not what is done now
Aug 30 13:59:57 <brrian>	Main.html is normal and includes Main.js (which has 100's of files) and all the redundant includes are removed
Aug 30 14:00:04 <brrian>	the same for Test.html
Aug 30 14:00:19 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: in gnome-tweak-tool: Keyboard and Mouse -> Key theme -> Emacs
Aug 30 14:00:36 <mcatanzaro>	That's in GNOME 3.20, Ubuntu will have something older, but *probably* will be in the same place
Aug 30 14:00:52 <mcatanzaro>	(It will only work for GTK+ apps of course)
Aug 30 14:01:03 <brrian>	yeah
Aug 30 14:01:28 <brrian>	emacs bindings everywhere is one thing that OS X has done since NextStep probably, which I take for granted
Aug 30 14:01:38 <brrian>	I have fixed a few kill ring bugs in WebKit ;-)
Aug 30 14:01:39 <mcatanzaro>	Impressive
Aug 30 14:02:22 <mcatanzaro>	Yeah I remember someone (you?) talking about kill ring at the Contributors Meeting last year... I was more than a bit surprised to learn WebKit supports that
Aug 30 14:02:41 <mcatanzaro>	Anyway brrian some "good" news: emacs depends on WebKitGTK+ now
Aug 30 14:02:49 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: kill ring C-k C-y etc works in any Cocoa app
Aug 30 14:03:02 <mcatanzaro>	I do not know why, but the rumor I heard was so it could play videos
Aug 30 14:03:09 <brrian>	o_O
Aug 30 14:03:30 <brrian>	maybe it's necessary for EmacsOS
Aug 30 14:03:35 <brrian>	=P
Aug 30 14:03:59 <mcatanzaro>	They are using WebKit1 (very old/insecure WebKitGTK+ 2.4) though, so now I have the enviable task of proposing we remove Emacs from Fedora (won't happen, WK is an optional dependency) to get rid of WebKit1
Aug 30 14:05:11 <mcatanzaro>	Oh wow, looks like they switched to git, at long last....
Aug 30 14:05:13 <mcatanzaro>	http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git
Aug 30 14:05:59 <mcatanzaro>	http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/configure.ac#n2625 "Enable xwidgets if GTK3 and WebKitGTK+ are available."
Aug 30 14:06:17 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder what xwidgets are. And if I was gullible for believing videos. ;)
Aug 30 14:07:00 <brrian>	I tried to dual boot ubuntu on my fast new PC but the installer kernel panicked :(
Aug 30 14:07:06 <brrian>	so I'm doing this stuff back in my VM
Aug 30 14:07:19 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: Fedora!
Aug 30 14:07:31 <brrian>	yeah, I guess. :|
Aug 30 14:07:37 <brrian>	I have no allegiance
Aug 30 14:07:45 <mcatanzaro>	Fedora!
Aug 30 14:07:48 <brrian>	I do have fancy new hardware
Aug 30 14:08:11 <brrian>	well not that new, it's a Z170 chipset and a skylake i7
Aug 30 14:08:18 <mcatanzaro>	Ubuntu!
Aug 30 14:08:40 <mcatanzaro>	But seriously, Intel released a bad microcode update and it's apparently breaking Skylake laptops
Aug 30 14:09:00 <mcatanzaro>	You're safe on Ubuntu because Ubuntu doesn't update anything
Aug 30 14:09:00 <brrian>	I mean, how long does it take for Debian or Fedora or anyone to add a major Intel rev :) :P
Aug 30 14:09:17 <brrian>	not if the installer is borked
Aug 30 14:09:27 <mcatanzaro>	Oh yeah, you did just mention that
Aug 30 14:10:01 <brrian>	ok, sweet. the keybindings work
Aug 30 14:10:13 <brrian>	well, at least in GTK apps (not sublime)
Aug 30 14:13:03 <brrian>	heh. good ole CMake.
Aug 30 14:13:20 <brrian>	if I spent more time with it, it would be easier right? :P
Aug 30 14:13:34 <brrian>	Make is atrocious so I can't love it no matter how many hours
Aug 30 14:14:56 <annulen>	make is way more straightforward, flexible, never gets in your way
Aug 30 14:15:39 <brrian>	I agree with 1 and 2
Aug 30 14:15:41 <brrian>	not 3
Aug 30 14:15:49 <mcatanzaro>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/empathy/commit/?id=03ad9867f02aeb337d61b0b26ba687593bede9f0
Aug 30 14:15:55 <brrian>	or I guess, there are so many gotchas
Aug 30 14:16:22 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Have you been following meson?
Aug 30 14:16:44 <annulen>	not really
Aug 30 14:17:04 <mcatanzaro>	They're trying to be the next autotools/cmake replacement; got some traction with GStreamer and they're aiming for GNOME next
Aug 30 14:17:16 *	mcatanzaro intends to investigate it more seriously eventually
Aug 30 14:17:47 <annulen>	I was involved in premake some time ago
Aug 30 14:21:34 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: is there some concept of Engineering vs Production builds for webkitgtk?
Aug 30 14:21:52 <brrian>	there are some things we only usually include in builds from source, like the uncaught exception reporter
Aug 30 14:22:15 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: Yes, -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release vs. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
Aug 30 14:22:25 <mcatanzaro>	Also: -DDEVELOPER_MODE=ON
Aug 30 14:23:09 <brrian>	hmm, how would I convert that to ENGINEERING_BUILD? true if Debug or DEVELOPER_MODE=ON?
Aug 30 14:23:38 <brrian>	the combined Inspector.html.in uses ENGINEERING_BUILD macro just because that's what I know
Aug 30 14:23:42 <mcatanzaro>	Probably just if (DEVELOPER_MODE)
Aug 30 14:24:30 <mcatanzaro>	Debug vs. Release is more just about whether to compile debug info, or enable assertions, leak tracking of WebCore objects....
Aug 30 14:24:37 <brrian>	right
Aug 30 14:24:46 <brrian>	Mac port has a separate level above that
Aug 30 14:25:21 <mcatanzaro>	I forget what we use DEVELOPER_MODE for, probably for loading stuff from the current directory; that's probably what you want to use
Aug 30 14:25:33 <brrian>	ok!
Aug 30 14:34:31 <brrian>	annulen: do you know where the top-level ENABLE_WEBCORE, etc gets set?
Aug 30 14:34:50 <brrian>	I can't find it anywhere! don't know if ENABLE_WEBINSPECTORUI is necessary or just use ENABLE_WEBKIT2
Aug 30 14:35:46 <annulen>	brrian: OptionsXXX.cmake
Aug 30 14:36:00 <annulen>	but there is no ENABLE_WEBCORE afaik
Aug 30 14:36:15 <annulen>	oops, there is
Aug 30 14:38:21 <brrian>	so my new CMakeLists.txt isn't getting picked up.
Aug 30 14:38:31 <brrian>	but I added add_subdirectory to the top-level file
Aug 30 14:38:45 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: Strange, you might need to re-run cmake...?
Aug 30 14:39:00 <brrian>	well, I see it running again
Aug 30 14:39:06 <brrian>	maybe it's using some cached things
Aug 30 14:39:42 <annulen>	brrian: are you adding add_subdirectory to Source/CMakeLists.txt?
Aug 30 14:39:53 <brrian>	ya
Aug 30 15:08:25 <brrian>	annulen: now the file is picked up, but its definitions aren't accessible from OptionsGTK.cmake
Aug 30 15:08:30 <brrian>	o_O
Aug 30 15:10:23 <annulen>	brrian: it goes in reverse, OptionsGTK.cmake is visible everywhere
Aug 30 15:10:45 <brrian>	er, my bad
Aug 30 15:10:52 <brrian>	PlatformGTK.cmake in WebKit2
Aug 30 15:11:14 <annulen>	oh, they are separate from each other
Aug 30 15:11:22 <brrian>	can't see CMakeLists.txt in WebInspectorUI
Aug 30 15:12:49 <brrian>	I had kinda assumed all variables were global, maybe not
Aug 30 15:12:58 <annulen>	no, they aren't
Aug 30 15:13:20 <brrian>	I can move that particular rule to PlatformGTK.cmake in WebInspectorUI, then use the generated XML file from derived sources in WebKit2's PlatformGTK.cmake
Aug 30 15:13:33 <brrian>	now to figure out how the platform files get included.. :P
Aug 30 15:14:38 <annulen>	some time ago I tried to do similar thing in my fork for Qt port, but I gave up and ended up including WebInspectorUI/PlatformQt.cmake where resource are needed
Aug 30 15:16:10 <annulen>	https://github.com/annulen/webkit/commit/4dfce6e929322a61975b509663b55b46c445f10c
Aug 30 15:17:11 <brrian>	do the platform.cmake files just get automatically picked up?
Aug 30 15:17:15 <brrian>	can't see any refs
Aug 30 15:17:29 <annulen>	WEBKIT_INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILES_IF_EXISTS() pick them
Aug 30 15:17:46 <annulen>	if there is no WEBKIT_INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILES_IF_EXISTS in that dir, it's not picked :)
Aug 30 15:17:46 <brrian>	ahhhh
Aug 30 15:17:47 <brrian>	magics
Aug 30 15:17:48 <brrian>	ok
Aug 30 15:17:55 <brrian>	I wonder what that did
Aug 30 15:18:06 <brrian>	you folks are so helpful
Aug 30 15:18:34 <mcatanzaro>	My super key stopped working after I did something in gnome-initial-setup, I should be less helpful :(
Aug 30 15:18:45 <mcatanzaro>	Sorry, I meant gnome-tweak-tool
Aug 30 15:18:51 <mcatanzaro>	What did I change, I don't remember changing anything :(
Aug 30 15:22:09 <annulen>	brrian: btw, I use yet another script to bundle inspector files into resource file, qt resources are very similar but yet not 100% equivalent to glib resources, you can see its invocation in patch above
Aug 30 15:22:19 <brrian>	yeah I saw
Aug 30 15:22:41 <brrian>	so I have WebInspectorUI_RESOURCES
Aug 30 15:23:07 <brrian>	which include js, html, css. eventually that list would include combined files if needed
Aug 30 15:23:21 <brrian>	and the port-specific packager shouldn't care
Aug 30 15:23:35 <brrian>	it can filter out for JS or CSS or whatever if needs to do something special
Aug 30 15:24:01 <brrian>	as long as it searches WEBINSPECTORUI_DERIVED_SOURCES since that's where the combined files would go
Aug 30 15:25:12 <annulen>	I think we need shared list of inspector files + some switch what icon directory should be used
Aug 30 15:25:37 <annulen>	maintaining separate lists leads to omissions which go unnoticed
Aug 30 15:25:46 <brrian>	annulen: yeah, especially as I make things complicated
Aug 30 15:25:52 <brrian>	but can't each platform file append to the main list?
Aug 30 15:26:01 <annulen>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156165
Aug 30 15:26:12 <annulen>	yes
Aug 30 15:26:39 <brrian>	I need to find whoever does EFL and get them to use the shared list
Aug 30 15:26:42 <brrian>	it does something funky now
Aug 30 15:26:52 <annulen>	they grab everything
Aug 30 15:26:55 <annulen>	literally
Aug 30 15:27:29 <annulen>	look in Source/PlatformEFL.cmake
Aug 30 15:27:32 <brrian>	randomly minifying files with ES6 is probably not a good idea
Aug 30 15:27:35 <brrian>	yea I have it open
Aug 30 15:37:41 <brrian>	 Cannot find source file: /home/bburg/repos/webkit/OpenSource/WebKitBuild/Release/DerivedSources/WebInspectorUI/InspectorGResourceBundle.c
Aug 30 15:37:56 <brrian>	I appended it to WebKit2_DERIVED_SOURCES
Aug 30 15:38:19 <brrian>	the rule to create it is in WebInspectorUI/PlatformGTK.cmake, not sure why it can't see the reipe
Aug 30 15:38:21 <brrian>	recipe
Aug 30 15:41:27 <annulen>	brrian: you may need GENERATED property on that file
Aug 30 15:41:43 <annulen>	cmake is very dumb sometimes
Aug 30 15:43:31 <brrian>	didn't help.
Aug 30 15:44:43 <brrian>	maybe I need to add it to some dummy target in WebInspectorUI
Aug 30 15:45:43 <annulen>	be careful not to make it rebuilding on each run
Aug 30 15:46:35 <brrian>	something we have done in Make before is output a file with the contents of a list
Aug 30 15:46:50 <brrian>	to force it to invalidate when the list changes
Aug 30 15:47:47 <brrian>	add_custom_target(stageSharedScripts DEPENDS ${JavaScriptCore_SCRIPTS})
Aug 30 15:47:47 <brrian>	add_dependencies(JavaScriptCore stageSharedScripts)
Aug 30 15:47:52 <brrian>	that looks similar

Aug 31 19:27:15 <memeka>	i tried to compile webkit with USE_GSTREAMER_GL=ON and GLES2=ON, but there's a conflict with ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS
Aug 31 19:28:02 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Just an FYI, USE_GSTREAMER_GL and ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS are not supported
Aug 31 19:28:03 <memeka>	i commented out the WEBKIT_OPTION_CONFLICT(ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS ENABLE_GLES2) option, but many hours later => error compiling, redefinition of functions from GLX and GLES
Aug 31 19:28:24 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: my understanding was that it should work now, in trunk
Aug 31 19:28:49 <mcatanzaro>	Ah well the conflict is there for a reason, it means you have to pick one or the other. :)  ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS uses CairoGL, which I suppose requires OpenGL not OpenGLES...?
Aug 31 19:29:03 <mcatanzaro>	Why do you think it should work?
Aug 31 19:29:12 <memeka>	i disabled ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS  but something was still enabling it :(
Aug 31 19:29:30 <memeka>	because philn and KaL told me so
Aug 31 19:30:31 <memeka>	ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS should work with (APPEND CAIROGL_COMPONENTS cairo-egl)
Aug 31 19:30:36 <memeka>	instead of cairo-glx
Aug 31 19:30:52 <mcatanzaro>	Hmm, you'll probably want to ask them tomorrow then... I'm not sure why they'd say that, if we have a WEBKIT_OPTION_CONFLICT and it doesn't work with the conflict removed.
Aug 31 19:31:28 <memeka>	in any case, o set ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS  OFF, but it ends up ON anyway
Aug 31 19:31:30 <memeka>	dunno why
Aug 31 19:31:34 <mcatanzaro>	Keep in mind, they both use Debian, so they don't have access to CairoGL (it's disabled in Debian) and can't build with ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS themselves....
Aug 31 19:32:35 <memeka>	i have ubuntu, so it's the same
Aug 31 19:32:53 <memeka>	btw, how can i compile webkit to use system's cairo, gst, etc?
Aug 31 19:33:06 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: OK, are you using the build-webkit script, and update-webkitgtk-libs?
Aug 31 19:33:07 <memeka>	can i just skip Tools/Scripts/update-webkitgtk-libs ?
Aug 31 19:33:23 <memeka>	if i skip that, will it find the system libs?
Aug 31 19:33:28 <mcatanzaro>	It looks like build-webkit enables ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS
Aug 31 19:33:40 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Yes indeed
Aug 31 19:33:57 <mcatanzaro>	And update-webkitgtk-libs installs a version of Cairo with CairoGL support compiled
Aug 31 19:34:02 <mcatanzaro>	OK, so that's what's going on
Aug 31 19:34:07 <memeka>	rather, what's the proper way to build it? (ubuntu) ?
Aug 31 19:34:14 <memeka>	i used: https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/BuildingGtk
Aug 31 19:34:35 <memeka>	but update-webkitgtk-libs compiles its own libs - i want to use the system's installed ones
Aug 31 19:34:59 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: You probably don't want to use build-webkit or update-webkitgtk-libs unless you want to do development on WebKit itself. I would just run CMake directly; the instructions on that page are for developers.
Aug 31 19:35:30 <mcatanzaro>	'cmake -DPORT=GTK' should be enough (you probably also want to pass -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release or Debug)
Aug 31 19:35:32 <memeka>	k, so then just cd build; cmake  ..; make -j8 ?
Aug 31 19:35:46 <memeka>	k, thx!
Aug 31 19:35:48 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Yes. You can also pass -GNinja and use ninja instead of make, it will go faster
Aug 31 19:36:02 <memeka>	don't think i have ninja installed :D
Aug 31 19:36:50 <mcatanzaro>	You could also try: "build-webkit --disable-accelerated-2d-canvas" but I don't think you need to be using the build-webkit script
Aug 31 19:37:05 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: i want USE_GSTREAMER_GL because gst sink on wayland is software, very slow :(
Aug 31 19:37:16 <memeka>	i will try using cmake
Aug 31 19:38:31 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: I hope it works for you, just keep in mind that if it worked reliably, it would be enabled by default, or at least not a hidden option. So be prepared for broken stuff, patches welcome, etc. philn is the right person for questions about it.
Aug 31 19:38:56 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: thanks. this is what i'm trying: http://paste.debian.net/799304/
Aug 31 19:39:45 <mcatanzaro>	Oh you don't need to patch anything, use 'cmake -DUSE_GSTREAMER_GL=ON -DENABLE_GLES2=ON'
Aug 31 19:40:20 <mcatanzaro>	(ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS is already OFF if you use cmake directly, instead of build-webkit. It's build-webkit that was turning on experimental development features :)
Aug 31 19:41:34 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: thx
Aug 31 19:41:52 <memeka>	GStreamerGL is needed for USE_GSTREAMER_GL.
Aug 31 19:41:53 <memeka>	hmm
Aug 31 19:42:33 <mcatanzaro>	You need gstreamer-gl-1.0.pc
Aug 31 19:43:25 <memeka>	yup i was just installing it now :d
Aug 31 19:43:32 <memeka>	weird i  don';t have it
Aug 31 19:44:10 <mcatanzaro>	Hm, we don't have that .pc file anywhere in Fedora
Aug 31 19:45:33 <memeka>	it's gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad-dev in debian/ubuntu
Aug 31 19:45:34 <memeka>	http://paste.debian.net/799325/
Aug 31 19:46:09 <memeka>	i'll do ENABLE_X11_TARGET = OFF
Aug 31 19:46:15 <memeka>	it won't break stuff, will it? :D
Aug 31 19:46:37 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: It *should* work. It's supported. Does anybody ever test it? Will it actually work? Not sure. ;)
Aug 31 19:47:11 <memeka>	hm, i'll leave it in :)
Aug 31 19:47:33 <memeka>	you never know :)
Aug 31 19:47:51 <mcatanzaro>	Interesting, looks like Fedora just "enabled GLES support in GStreamerGL" in rawhide a couple weeks ago: http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free.git/commit/?id=6dbf8cb598b4617ca9c764477aa8606ccec5e272
Aug 31 19:48:20 <mcatanzaro>	So we have it, where is the .pc file...?
Aug 31 19:49:19 <mcatanzaro>	Ahha it's there, I just did  my search wrong. Irrelevant to you, you don't use Fedora, I'm just talking to myself on IRC....
Aug 31 19:52:10 <memeka>	:)
Aug 31 19:52:26 <memeka>	then maybe gst opengl sink may work
Aug 31 19:52:27 <memeka>	:D
Aug 31 19:53:49 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: do i have to make install as well, or can i use it in its build folder?
Aug 31 19:54:09 <memeka>	and also, do u know how to make epiphany work with non-system webkit? :D
Aug 31 19:54:13 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: If you're just testing MiniBrowser, you don't need to make install
Aug 31 19:54:29 <memeka>	how do i run MiniBrowser?
Aug 31 19:54:32 <mcatanzaro>	If you want Epiphany to work... my recommendation is to use GNOME JHBuild
Aug 31 19:55:44 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Tools/Scripts/run-minibrowser --gtk
Aug 31 19:56:19 <memeka>	mcatanzaro i just want to test a youtube video with gstreamer - decoding is already accelerated on my system, but the sink was very slow (wayland SHM); gstreamer's opengl sink is very fast, so i want to check if it works in webkit; i can make later a nicely packaged ubuntu .deb
Aug 31 19:56:40 <mcatanzaro>	MiniBrowser is the easiest way to test it then
Aug 31 19:56:45 <memeka>	awesome
Aug 31 19:57:06 <memeka>	compiling w/o deps is SO much faster :))
Aug 31 19:57:33 <mcatanzaro>	Here are instructions if you want to use it with Epiphany: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web/Development
Aug 31 19:57:43 <mcatanzaro>	(Much easier to use MiniBrowser ;)
Aug 31 19:58:07 <memeka>	ah ok, so i need to build epiphany....
Aug 31 19:58:24 <memeka>	i can't just use existing one and use LD_LIBRARY_PATH or something ...
Aug 31 19:58:47 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: maaaaaybe!
Aug 31 19:59:15 <memeka>	i'll check that too :) but minibrowser is easier
Sep 01 05:47:23 <memeka>	anyone alive?
Sep 01 05:48:19 <philn>	hi memeka
Sep 01 05:48:26 <memeka>	there;s an issue
Sep 01 05:48:35 <memeka>	with GSTREAMER_GL
Sep 01 05:48:57 <memeka>	i am compiling with GLES2=ON, GSTREAMER_GL=ON, ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS=OFF
Sep 01 05:49:35 <philn>	what's the error?
Sep 01 05:49:45 <memeka>	well, first, i had to install cairo GL
Sep 01 05:50:03 <memeka>	then:
Sep 01 05:50:07 <memeka>	#if USE(CAIRO) && ENABLE(ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS)
Sep 01 05:50:07 <memeka>	#include <cairo-gl.h>
Sep 01 05:50:07 <memeka>	#endif
Sep 01 05:50:25 <memeka>	but, even without ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS, there's cairo GL functions used
Sep 01 05:51:00 <philn>	there's one possibly related bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=159562
Sep 01 05:51:41 <memeka>	that's not it
Sep 01 05:51:42 <memeka>	somehow
Sep 01 05:51:52 <memeka>	NativeImagePtr MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase::nativeImageForCurrentTime()
Sep 01 05:51:58 <memeka>	should return nullptr
Sep 01 05:52:12 <memeka>	#if !USE(CAIRO) || !ENABLE(ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS)
Sep 01 05:52:12 <memeka>	    return nullptr;
Sep 01 05:52:12 <memeka>	#endif
Sep 01 05:52:29 <memeka>	however
Sep 01 05:52:36 <memeka>	build fails few lines lower
Sep 01 05:52:46 <memeka>	at cairo_gl_device_set_thread_aware
Sep 01 05:54:32 <philn>	so you haven't correctly disabled the acc 2D canvas support
Sep 01 05:55:01 <memeka>	well
Sep 01 05:55:03 <memeka>	per the same file
Sep 01 05:55:09 <memeka>	cairo-gl is not included :))
Sep 01 05:57:35 <philn>	what's the cmake command line you use?
Sep 01 05:59:21 <philn>	and double-check the CMakeCache.txt correctly reflects the configuration you need
Sep 01 06:01:23 <memeka>	philn: cmake -DPORT=GTK -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_GSTREAMER_GL=ON -DENABLE_GLES2=ON -DENABLE_JIT=OFF -DUSE_SYSTEM_MALLOC=ON  -DENABLE_X11_TARGET=OFF -DENABLE_MINIBROWSER=ON ..
Sep 01 06:02:16 <philn>	add -DENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS=OFF
Sep 01 06:03:55 <memeka>	hm i am pretty sure actually i added that
Sep 01 06:03:59 <memeka>	sorry it was many hours ago
Sep 01 06:04:09 <memeka>	compiling takes ages :(
Sep 01 06:04:23 <memeka>	is there a log to check if it's ON?
Sep 01 06:04:57 <memeka>	cat CMakeCache.txt | grep CANVAS
Sep 01 06:04:58 <memeka>	ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS:BOOL=OFF
Sep 01 06:04:58 <memeka>	ENABLE_CANVAS_PATH:BOOL=OFF
Sep 01 06:04:58 <memeka>	ENABLE_CANVAS_PROXY:BOOL=OFF
Sep 01 06:06:50 <KaL>	memeka: check cmakeconfig.h
Sep 01 06:07:16 <philn>	ah but you still have USE(CAIRO) so it's normal the early return isn't triggered
Sep 01 06:07:34 <memeka>	yup
Sep 01 06:07:40 <memeka>	cat cmakeconfig.h | grep -i canvas
Sep 01 06:07:40 <memeka>	#define ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS 0
Sep 01 06:07:40 <memeka>	#define ENABLE_CANVAS_PATH 0
Sep 01 06:07:40 <memeka>	#define ENABLE_CANVAS_PROXY 0
Sep 01 06:07:47 <philn>	but the include isn't done, i see
Sep 01 06:07:52 <memeka>	yup
Sep 01 06:08:00 <memeka>	anw, i forced the include
Sep 01 06:08:05 <memeka>	hope it's gonna compile
Sep 01 06:08:18 <memeka>	just wanted to report this
Sep 01 06:08:35 <philn>	change that ifdef to #if USE(CAIRO) && ENABLE(GLES2) (or maybe ENABLE(OPENGL))
Sep 01 06:09:05 <philn>	can you file a bugreport please?
Sep 01 06:09:08 <memeka>	i just commented out the if :)
Sep 01 06:09:20 <memeka>	hm, where do i report?
Sep 01 06:09:29 <memeka>	(do i need to make account :-S)
Sep 01 06:09:30 <memeka>	:D
Sep 01 06:09:32 <philn>	bugs.webkit.org
Sep 01 06:10:00 <philn>	ok i'll just do it then
Sep 01 06:11:03 <memeka>	philn: thanks :)
Sep 01 06:11:29 <memeka>	i think there aren't many ppl that will hit this issue :))
Sep 01 06:12:46 <memeka>	is cairo-gl really gonna be used?
Sep 01 06:13:09 <memeka>	first time i hit this issue, i recompiled cairo with gl support
Sep 01 06:13:19 <memeka>	then i hit it again, hours later :))
Sep 01 06:13:30 <philn>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161482
Sep 01 06:13:36 <memeka>	philn: thanks
Sep 01 06:15:09 <philn>	that method is used only when a <video> element is used within webgl and/or canvas
Sep 01 06:17:45 <memeka>	anyway .. 2 days later, I'm @ 86% :)) never got this far
Sep 01 06:46:14 <memeka>	philn, KaL /mnt/src/webkit/Source/WebKit2/UIProcess/AcceleratedDrawingAreaProxy.cpp: In member function ‘void WebKit::AcceleratedDrawingAreaProxy::setNativeSurfaceHandleForCompositing(uint64_t)’: /mnt/src/webkit/Source/WebKit2/UIProcess/AcceleratedDrawingAreaProxy.cpp:271:129: error: ‘DispatchMessageEvenWhenWaitingForSyncReply’ is not a member of

Sep 01 06:46:21 <memeka>	any idea about this one?
Sep 01 06:46:53 <philn>	hum nope
Sep 01 06:48:19 <memeka>	it's the only IPC in that file
Sep 01 06:48:24 <memeka>	no idea where it comes from
Sep 01 06:48:45 <philn>	Source/WebKit2/Platform/IPC/Connection.h
Sep 01 06:49:26 <memeka>	Connection.h is not included there ... but maybe something else is including it
Sep 01 06:50:58 <memeka>	should i include it?
Sep 01 06:51:09 <memeka>	namespace IPC {
Sep 01 06:51:09 <memeka>	 
Sep 01 06:51:09 <memeka>	enum class SendOption {
Sep 01 06:51:09 <memeka>	    // Whether this message should be dispatched when waiting for a sync reply.
Sep 01 06:51:09 <memeka>	    // This is the default for synchronous messages.
Sep 01 06:51:10 <memeka>	    DispatchMessageEvenWhenWaitingForSyncReply = 1 << 0,
Sep 01 06:51:10 <memeka>	};
Sep 01 06:51:21 <philn>	sounds worth a try
Sep 01 06:52:15 <memeka>	or is it IPC::SendOption::DispatchMessageEvenWhenWaitingForSyncReply ?
Sep 01 06:52:28 <memeka>	sorry my C++ skills are towards 0 :)
Sep 01 06:53:04 <philn>	IPC::Dispatch... should work
Sep 01 06:54:53 <memeka>	can i just replace it with "1 << 0" ?
Sep 01 06:58:20 <KaL>	memeka: IPC::SendOption::DispatchMessageEvenWhenWaitingForSyncReply
Sep 01 06:58:37 <KaL>	it was converted ot an enum class
Sep 01 06:59:19 <KaL>	memeka: so, you are building without wayland and without redirected xcomposite window?
Sep 01 06:59:31 <memeka>	KaL: thx, thought so, but like i said, no C++ in many years
Sep 01 06:59:36 <memeka>	I am build WITH wayland
Sep 01 07:00:11 <memeka>	ENABLE_WAYLAND_TARGET:BOOL=ON
Sep 01 07:00:12 <KaL>	hmm, :SetNativeSurfaceHandleForCompositing should not be compiled in wayland, we need to fix that
Sep 01 07:00:40 <philn>	ah i was reading my old code instead of your pasted code, sorry
Sep 01 07:00:43 <KaL>	memeka: please, file bug reports for all this problems you are finding
Sep 01 07:00:57 <memeka>	philn ? :D :D :D
Sep 01 07:02:01 <philn>	memeka: seems like it's time for you to create a bugzilla account :)
Sep 01 07:02:16 <memeka>	goddamit
Sep 01 07:02:19 <memeka>	k :)
Sep 01 07:13:05 <memeka>	philn KaL : ource/WebKit2/UIProcess/gtk/AcceleratedBackingStoreWayland.cpp line 75
Sep 01 07:13:26 <KaL>	what
Sep 01 07:13:27 <memeka>	can i use that gdk_cairo_draw_from_gl ?
Sep 01 07:13:50 <memeka>	looks like i don't have GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH used few lines down
Sep 01 07:14:24 <KaL>	maybe we should use that conditionally
Sep 01 07:14:30 <KaL>	file a bug report for that too
Sep 01 07:14:32 <memeka>	not sure GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH is in EGL/GLES
Sep 01 07:14:50 <KaL>	so that's what we should fix
Sep 01 07:15:06 <memeka>	how can i fix it for now?
Sep 01 07:15:09 <KaL>	gdk_cairo_draw_from_gl will not work, it will render the texture inverted
Sep 01 07:15:23 <memeka>	is there a fix i can try?
Sep 01 07:15:33 <memeka>	instead of GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH ?
Sep 01 07:22:22 <memeka>	KaL ?
Sep 01 07:42:31 <KaL>	memeka: I don't know, i'm not opengl expert, file a bug report and I'll investigate
Sep 01 07:43:48 <KaL>	I saw the reports, thanks!
Sep 01 07:46:13 <annulen>	KaL: will there be 2.12.5?
Sep 01 07:46:42 <KaL>	annulen: I don't know, is there anything wrong with .4?
Sep 01 07:47:31 <memeka>	KaL: actually i found i have that in GLESv3 which is supported by my GPU
Sep 01 07:47:46 <KaL>	memeka: comment on the bug
Sep 01 07:47:50 <memeka>	so i just replaced GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH with 0x0D02 so as not to include gl3.h
Sep 01 07:47:54 <KaL>	any info will be useful
Sep 01 07:48:34 <annulen>	KaL: at least one patch is worthwhile to include, here is a backported version: https://github.com/annulen/webkit/commit/73bcc7a950eb5b66a76a774fa73dc70c824d4563
Sep 01 07:49:17 <KaL>	annulen: update the wiki then, please
Sep 01 07:49:37 <KaL>	I'll make nre releases as long as there are candiate commits to be moreged
Sep 01 07:49:41 <KaL>	*new
Sep 01 07:49:49 <KaL>	*mreged
Sep 01 07:50:00 <KaL>	ok, I don't know how to type
Sep 01 07:55:01 <annulen>	KaL: cool, thanks. btw I hope you can stumble upon something suitable when preparing 2.14.0 :)
Sep 01 08:14:52 <memeka>	KaL: build finished, run a youtube video - it's still slow :(
Sep 01 08:15:27 <memeka>	how can i check the GL sink is being used?
Sep 01 09:19:08 <memeka>	KaL, philn - pages don't load :(
Sep 01 09:26:07 <philn>	don't load or are not rendered?
Sep 01 09:26:25 <philn>	without any details it's a bit hard to guess what's going on
Sep 01 09:34:49 <memeka>	philn: don't load
Sep 01 09:35:06 <memeka>	Tabs are stuck with the loading icon
Sep 01 09:35:17 <memeka>	And nothing gets rendered
Sep 01 09:35:28 <philn>	memeka: what if you try a file:///path/to/some/webpage.html ?
Sep 01 09:36:06 <philn>	1
Sep 01 09:40:44 <memeka>	philn: nothing
Sep 01 09:44:58 <memeka>	philn: http://imgur.com/a/tOqJZ
Sep 01 09:45:36 <annulen>	I guess strace -e open would help
Sep 01 09:45:54 <annulen>	oops, forgot -f
Sep 01 09:46:12 <annulen>	does it read that file or not
Sep 01 09:46:13 <philn>	looks like the the web process is hanging?
Sep 01 09:49:08 <memeka>	philn: will try that tmr, late here :(
Sep 01 10:06:59 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos it looks like there is an DOM API breakage in 2.13.90 -> we are missing webkit_dom_html_element_insert_adjacent_text (instead there is webkit_dom_element_insert_adjacent_text )..
Sep 01 10:07:11 <tpopela>	KaL, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/418922/
Sep 01 10:09:22 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, ^
Sep 01 10:09:57 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Was it stable API...?
Sep 01 10:10:26 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, hmm that's a question.. probably not.. let me see.
Sep 01 10:10:43 <mcatanzaro>	You can just switch to the new function, right?
Sep 01 10:10:54 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, yep, unstable..
Sep 01 10:11:41 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, yes :).. until then the Evo will be broken with 2.13.90, but I can survive that ;)
Sep 01 11:04:24 <KaL>	tpopela: that's not a break, because that's not stable api
Sep 01 11:04:44 <tpopela>	KaL, yes I know.. I thought it was in stable ;)
Sep 01 11:04:55 <KaL>	tpopela: it was just moved to element
Sep 01 11:05:01 <KaL>	so it's easy to fix
Sep 01 11:07:50 <tpopela>	KaL, exactly.. already building a fixed version.. there was also another change for webkit_dom_html_element_insert_adjacent_html() and webkit_dom_dom_selection_set_base_and_extent().. Actually it's not that bad when you realize it is mostly caused by cdumez changing the DOM API to be specific compliant -> and that's a good thing..
Sep 01 14:07:58 <ManDay>	Does any of surf, midori or xombrero support current webkit?
Sep 01 14:08:13 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: No, those browsers are all insecure, don't use them
Sep 01 14:08:46 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: What do you mean by insecure? I'm currently using MiniBrowser - are you suggesting that is more safe?
Sep 01 14:09:44 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Yes, if it's the latest version of MiniBrowser (should say 2.12.4)
Sep 01 14:10:02 <mcatanzaro>	https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/03/on-subresource-certificate-validation/ is interesting
Sep 01 14:10:12 <mcatanzaro>	As is https://webkitgtk.org/security.html
Sep 01 14:10:47 <ManDay>	Thanks. I'm sure Midori will be fixed asap
Sep 01 14:10:58 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: No it won't
Sep 01 14:11:49 <ManDay>	I'm just looking for a lightweight Webkit browser. Actually I'm almost happy with minirbrowser, but I need some means of password completon and choosing the download folder
Sep 01 14:12:03 <mcatanzaro>	See: "I’ve been in touch with Midori, but they say they don’t have the resources to fix it, since it would require rewriting large portions of the code base in order to be able to use the fixed webkit." and: "I reported this to the Midori developers in late 2014" and: "t’s hard to understate how bad this is: it makes HTTPS completely worthless"
Sep 01 14:12:10 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: why you say that? midori is very actively improved
Sep 01 14:12:17 <ManDay>	oh
Sep 01 14:12:31 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: The thing is, MiniBrowser is just a developer testing tool, it will never grow any of those features. Epiphany is our real flagship browser.
Sep 01 14:13:06 <ManDay>	i assume epiphany is extremely heavy on deps and probably even requires X11
Sep 01 14:13:12 <ManDay>	but I'll have a look, thanks
Sep 01 14:13:40 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: The configure script currently requires X11, but that's a bug; it's not actually needed and would be simple to fix, if you want to send a patch
Sep 01 14:14:15 <ManDay>	ok. in any case I guess i have to compile from tarball because gentoo fucks up the deps, as usual
Sep 01 14:14:16 <mcatanzaro>	Just needs a new configure flag to skip the PKG_CHECK_MODULES checks. The code itself already has #ifdefs in (hopefully) all the right places
Sep 01 14:14:50 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: is there any simple way to test browser for this vulnerability?
Sep 01 14:14:53 <mcatanzaro>	FWIW you can compare midori development: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~midori/midori/trunk/changes
Sep 01 14:15:00 <mcatanzaro>	epiphany development: https://git.gnome.org/browse/epiphany/log/
Sep 01 14:15:23 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: For TLS subresource verification? Yes, there is a test page on Ryan's web site, linked from my blog post
Sep 01 14:15:28 <mcatanzaro>	Check your port :)
Sep 01 14:16:09 <ManDay>	Is this "JHbuild" thing really necessary to build epiphany?
Sep 01 14:16:14 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Here's the thing: with Midori you have >150 unfixed public vulnerabilities in WebKit. Epiphany uses newer WebKit, with 2.12.4 you have 0 unfixed public vulnerabilities. (Public meaning: announced. Probably there are many not public.)
Sep 01 14:16:36 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: No, it's not necessary. It's the easiest way to build the latest development version, but it's not want you want to build a Gentoo package.
Sep 01 14:17:09 <ManDay>	I want to build NOT from the gentoo packages. I want to build from upstream source. Gentoo is a fuckup for deps
Sep 01 14:17:13 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: as I expected, it's not vulnerable :)
Sep 01 14:17:21 <mcatanzaro>	:)
Sep 01 14:17:59 <mcatanzaro>	Anyway ManDay: to make Epiphany build without X11, what you want is to use pkg-config in the configure script to check GTK+'s pkg-config variables
Sep 01 14:18:10 <mcatanzaro>	There is a field in its pkg-config file that tells you what backends GTK+ was compiled with
Sep 01 14:18:18 <mcatanzaro>	We should check that variable and see if X11 is there
Sep 01 14:18:56 <mcatanzaro>	If not, we can remove the X11-specific PKG_CHECK_MODULES calls as we already don't use X11 stuff in that case
Sep 01 14:19:10 <mcatanzaro>	You should only need to modify configure.ac and nothing else
Sep 01 14:19:53 <ManDay>	my experience with autotools is limited at best but Ill try
Sep 01 14:24:57 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: You want to use the PKG_CHECK_VAR macro. It's documented in man pkg-config(1)
Sep 01 14:25:17 <manday1>	Not a day goes by without shit crashing down on me...
Sep 01 14:26:09 <mcatanzaro>	manday1: You want to use the PKG_CHECK_VAR macro. It's documented in man pkg-config(1)
Sep 01 14:26:35 <manday1>	mcatanzaro: First, I have to get there. epiphany git requires me to go bleeding edge on a lot of packages
Sep 01 14:27:06 <mcatanzaro>	manday1: Should only require new WebKit. You can revert that need, too, one sec
Sep 01 14:27:23 <mcatanzaro>	It needs GTK+ 3.20 also but that's been out for five months now, hardly bleeding edge
Sep 01 14:28:24 <manday1>	mcatanzaro: First thing I hit was getting a new gettext version
Sep 01 14:28:35 <mcatanzaro>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/epiphany/log/embed/web-extension/ephy-web-overview.c <-- there are four commits there that deal with a WebKit unstable API break, you can just revert them and then lower the WebKit requirement in configure.ac
Sep 01 14:28:36 <manday1>	which apparently is more difficult than it sounds - because that breaks other packages
Sep 01 14:28:43 <mcatanzaro>	Oh yeah new gettext, that's true
Sep 01 14:29:01 <manday1>	my webkit is bleeding edge, no problem there
Sep 01 14:29:11 <manday1>	2.13.4 or what it is
Sep 01 14:29:13 <mcatanzaro>	jhbuild would handle all these deps for you :-)
Sep 01 14:29:41 <mcatanzaro>	manday1: So the other browsers you mentioned earlier are all incompatible with webkit > 2.4
Sep 01 14:29:43 <manday1>	hah, i won't let some stray wannabe package manager mess with my system. i rarely let portage mess with it
Sep 01 14:29:51 <manday1>	mcatanzaro: i know, thus my initial question
Sep 01 14:30:39 <mcatanzaro>	manday1: You could build from the gnome-3-22 branch instead of master. That's what we're releasing as stable later this month. master won't be stable until March.
Sep 01 14:30:48 <mcatanzaro>	And that branch doesn't require new gettext
Sep 01 14:31:23 <manday1>	oh good
Sep 01 14:32:38 <manday1>	I'm so bloody pissed how many crashes I get. If it weren't for tmux I could practically forget about doing *anything* in wayland
Sep 01 14:46:50 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: with gnome-3-22 I get a syntax error in configure
Sep 01 14:47:11 <ManDay>	on AX_IS_RELEASE(git-directory)
Sep 01 14:47:39 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: You need autoconf-archive installed (or m4-common from GNOME git, which is a subset of autoconf-archive)
Sep 01 14:48:03 <ManDay>	oh dear... why cant just everyone use cmake
Sep 01 14:48:13 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: We're talking about meson now
Sep 01 14:48:43 <ManDay>	hm?
Sep 01 14:49:05 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: http://mesonbuild.com/
Sep 01 14:49:36 <ManDay>	but why not cmake
Sep 01 14:51:11 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Very old debate. It's not really THAT much nicer than autotools and people already know how to use autotools. It makes uninstall difficult, it makes tarball generation difficult, find modules are way worse than pkg-config, we'd have to rewrite a bunch of support macros (which meson already has)....
Sep 01 14:51:33 <mcatanzaro>	If we were gonna switch to CMake, it would have happened 10 years ago
Sep 01 14:52:31 <ManDay>	then I'd be happy if you stick with autotools. yet another build system? no thanks ;-( (though only personal opinion)
Sep 01 14:53:32 <ManDay>	configure.ac:63: error: macro APPSTREAM_XML is not defined; is a m4 file missing?
Sep 01 14:53:35 <ManDay>	/usr/share/aclocal/ax_require_defined.m4:35: AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED is expanded from...
Sep 01 14:53:36 <ManDay>	configure.ac:63: the top level
Sep 01 14:53:38 <ManDay>	y
Sep 01 14:53:46 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: You need appstream-glib
Sep 01 14:56:23 <ManDay>	why do I get those weird errors of configure.ac failing instead of proper errors *by* configure where it tells me that a package could not be found?
Sep 01 14:57:53 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: In the dark ages before AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED (i.e. last year) the error message was totally inscrutable, at least now you know a macro is missing. ;)  APPSTREAM_XML is required to build appdata files so it should be required by all GUI apps. jhbuild takes care of it for you. ;)
Sep 01 14:58:20 <mcatanzaro>	Of course, if you don't have autoconf-archive already, then using AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED doesn't help :D
Sep 01 15:00:06 <ManDay>	sorry but from the ignorant user's perspective (that is, mine) this is a mess. I'd expect that when I run autogen every error in autogen is a developer error and the missing dependencies are properly reported by ./configure
Sep 01 15:00:18 <ManDay>	ok... sorry for the pointless complaint
Sep 01 15:00:30 *	mcatanzaro shrugs
Sep 01 15:00:39 <mcatanzaro>	AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED is the new best practice
Sep 01 15:00:45 <mcatanzaro>	Used to be worse!
Sep 01 15:03:57 <ManDay>	I have no clue of autotools and I should not need to to compile anything.
Sep 01 15:05:41 <ManDay>	now YELP_HELP_INIT is missing
Sep 01 15:06:08 <ManDay>	ok, this looks like autotools will, through obscure error messages, coerce me into installing the whole gnome bundle
Sep 01 15:06:30 <ManDay>	not gonna happen though
Sep 01 15:06:43 <ManDay>	thanks mcatanzaro but I guess I'll have to stay with minibrowser
Sep 01 15:07:35 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: You need yelp-tools... it's for building the user help ;)
Sep 01 15:08:00 <mcatanzaro>	I'm pretty sure that's the last dependency btw, you've made it to the bottom of the configure script!
Sep 01 15:08:26 *	mcatanzaro actually looks at configure script
Sep 01 15:08:39 <mcatanzaro>	OK you haven't, but the rest is all pkg-config dependencies
Sep 01 15:09:21 <ManDay>	thanks, but just so I understand this:
Sep 01 15:09:37 <ManDay>	autoconf complains about a missing dependency, and NOT the configure script?
Sep 01 15:09:39 <ManDay>	why?
Sep 01 15:10:22 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Because you are missing m4 macros needed to generate the configure script. If you were building from a release tarball, instead of from git, the macros would already be in the tarball and the configure script would already be generated
Sep 01 15:10:39 <mcatanzaro>	Since you're building from git, you need to install developer tools needed to generate the configure script
Sep 01 15:11:01 <mcatanzaro>	We don't want to carry the same boilerplate macros around in each GNOME repo for generating documentation or appdata files, instead we just expect you to install them once
Sep 01 15:12:01 <ManDay>	ok, but this kind of stuff would not happen with a buildsystem like cmake, right? In Cmake, a program depends on modules/packages and thats it. You would depend ony Yelp and if its not installed cmake gives you proper error
Sep 01 15:12:13 <ManDay>	this is autotools crappy design
Sep 01 15:12:37 <ManDay>	you were right
Sep 01 15:12:41 <ManDay>	it passed now
Sep 01 15:13:33 <ManDay>	but now comes the whole bunch of deps that I'm not willing to take from the configure script
Sep 01 15:14:01 <ManDay>	gnome-desktop-3.0 libsecret libnotify etc
Sep 01 15:14:14 <mcatanzaro>	libsecret is for the password storage you wanted ;)
Sep 01 15:14:42 <mcatanzaro>	gnome-desktop-3.0 is for snapshots, to display the pages in the overview; it doesn't actually install a desktop, it's just some shared APIs
Sep 01 15:14:48 <mcatanzaro>	libnotify is for HTML desktop notifications
Sep 01 15:15:41 <ManDay>	yeah i know. but next I need gnome-keyring which is again 2 page of deps (including X11) at least in portage and so on
Sep 01 15:15:52 <ManDay>	this is just going to be too painful
Sep 01 15:16:20 <ManDay>	it's probably possible in theory, just not pratically for me ;-(
Sep 01 15:16:46 <ManDay>	Thanks anyway. getting to the configure script at least I know I can do it now
Sep 01 15:16:57 <ManDay>	though cleaning out the deps will take a week at least
Sep 01 15:17:29 <annulen>	you should have used jhbuild instead
Sep 01 15:18:04 <ManDay>	annulen: and what would that have done? just installed all the messy deps with X11 etc, right? Then I could aswell use what is in portage
Sep 01 15:18:30 <ManDay>	which will pull in approx 100 packages and requires a lot of fixing of the current USE flags
Sep 01 15:18:40 <ManDay>	anyway, thanks
Sep 01 15:19:06 <ManDay>	i got to sleep now. probably i have more energy to do this tomorrow :)
Sep 01 15:21:14 *	mcatanzaro continues with life
Sep 02 03:22:21 <bertogg>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1320240
Sep 02 03:22:25 <bertogg>	is this a known upstream bug?
Sep 02 03:47:35 <tpopela>	bertogg, yes this is basically the same thing from 2.4.x and even before..
Sep 02 03:48:12 <tpopela>	bertogg, ah this one was different.. sorry..
Sep 02 03:48:41 <tpopela>	bertogg, this is gcc 6.x thing..
Sep 02 03:49:34 <tpopela>	bertogg, and only with WK1..
Sep 02 03:51:11 <bertogg>	only wk1 ?
Sep 02 03:51:24 <bertogg>	ok...
Sep 02 03:51:45 <bertogg>	I'll rebuild it then
Sep 02 04:01:10 <tpopela>	bertogg, I'm not sure with the WebKit2 from 2.4.x as we are not building it from there..
Sep 02 04:03:39 <bertogg>	tpopela: what's the affected version then?
Sep 02 04:04:06 <bertogg>	one user just told me that he's also affected
Sep 02 04:04:32 <tpopela>	bertogg, we are applying it on any 2.4.x release that is being compiled with gcc 6.0+
Sep 02 04:06:48 <bertogg>	well, we still have 2.4.x and we're using gcc 6 now afaik

Sep 05 10:20:41 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Let's stop using autokarma on non-critical WebKit updates, so each update gets a week in updates-testing. That would have caught the network process hang in 2.12.4.  (But let's still use it for this update, since 2.12.5 is critical to fix that hang. ;)
Sep 05 10:21:14 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, Hi :).. ok, I have no problem with that :)
Sep 05 11:01:10 <mcrha>	hi/ping mcatanzaro, I'm running the 2.13.90 release and it's crashing here on the webview close on the WebProcess side with this backtrace: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/422322/ I found one semi-related https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157973 but it looks like being already applied in the 2.13.90. Are you aware of anything similar, any changeset I would try locally?
Sep 05 11:01:50 <mcrha>	to be precise, it's the last WebView of that WebProcess, when it crashes.
Sep 05 11:02:11 <mcatanzaro>	mcrha: Please open a new bug, this crash is different
Sep 05 11:03:22 <mcrha>	mcatanzaro, sure, will do. Thanks
Sep 05 11:07:35 <mcrha>	mcatanzaro, here you are: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161605
Sep 05 14:37:39 <Dodji>	Hello
Sep 05 14:38:29 <mcatanzaro>	Hi Dodji, libwebkitgtk-1.0.so doesn't exist upstream anymore, so the ABI is not going to break
Sep 05 14:39:48 <mcatanzaro>	I don't think any functions should be exported unless they start with the webkit_ prefix, that's concerning. If you find any such functions in modern WebKit it might be worth reporting a bug. (But that ancient WebKit isn't supported anymore, don't bother reporting it.)
Sep 05 14:39:59 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: I just want to detect when the ABI *changes*, so that people can know what the changes are, just by looking at the binary.  It doesn't necessarily have to 'break' ...
Sep 05 14:40:19 <mcatanzaro>	Dodji: There won't be any ABI changes ever, because it will never be updated... :)
Sep 05 14:40:24 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: so that is the name of the *.so of the "new" webkit?
Sep 05 14:40:59 <mcatanzaro>	No, libwebkitgtk-1.0.so is WebKit1 for GTK+ 2
Sep 05 14:41:12 <Dodji>	ahh
Sep 05 14:41:13 <Dodji>	right
Sep 05 14:41:26 <mcatanzaro>	The only supported version that gets updated is webkit2gtk-4.0 (WebKit2 for GTK+ 3)
Sep 05 14:41:49 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: I see, thanks
Sep 05 14:41:54 <Dodji>	I'll look at that one
Sep 05 14:42:22 <mcatanzaro>	If you find an ABI break there, with the exception of the unstable portion of the DOM API, then please do file a bug
Sep 05 14:42:50 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: how do I know what the unstable part is?
Sep 05 14:43:18 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: I mean, the tooling is going to just look at functions that start with "webkit_" (at least in Fedora)
Sep 05 14:44:04 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: okay, just so you know, the tooling I am talking about is based on libabigail https://www.sourceware.org/libabigail/
Sep 05 14:45:37 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: There is now tooling in Fedora so that whenever a package is updated, we perform a deep comparison of the ABI of the new version of the package against the ABI of the last "stable" version.
Sep 05 14:45:49 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: that is meant to detect incompatible ABI changes.
Sep 05 14:46:44 <mcatanzaro>	Dodji: That's excellent! Unfortunately I doubt it will be possible to automatically detect which APIs are unstable and which aren't; you have to define a preprocessor macro to get the declarations, but the APIs will still be exported of course....
Sep 05 14:46:47 <Dodji>	but then webkit is one of the biggest c++ libraries around, with tons of exported stuff (at least for the ancient webkit).  So the game is to limit the scope of the comparison to stuff that make sense.
Sep 05 14:47:23 <mcatanzaro>	The unstable APIs are all going to be removed or stabilized before F26 is released, so that's good going forward. But in the meantime....
Sep 05 14:47:37 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: no problem (re unstable).  The main idea is to enable maintainers to *review* the ABI changes, you know, the way people review source code changes.
Sep 05 14:48:11 <mcatanzaro>	Dodji: OK, that's great then, if we get some warning about the ABI change without failing the package build
Sep 05 14:48:15 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: but in this case, the kind of change reports are going to be like this one: https://sourceware.org/libabigail/manual/abidiff.html#usage-examples
Sep 05 14:48:24 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: please look for "abidiff" in that page
Sep 05 14:48:40 <mcatanzaro>	FYI: I'm proposing to remove the webkitgtk (providing libwebkitgtk-1.0.so) and webkitgtk3 packages
Sep 05 14:48:41 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: see the ABI change report I am talking about?
Sep 05 14:48:54 <Dodji>	<mcatanzaro> Dodji: OK, that's great then, if we get some warning about the ABI change
Sep 05 14:48:55 <Dodji>		     without failing the package build
Sep 05 14:48:59 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: sure, that is the idea.
Sep 05 14:49:00 <mcatanzaro>	Yeah, that looks cool
Sep 05 14:49:35 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: and of course, the package maintainer can define "tight" rules to help detect what ABI change doesn't matter ets
Sep 05 14:49:36 <mcatanzaro>	It looks smart!
Sep 05 14:49:37 <Dodji>	etc
Sep 05 14:49:48 <Dodji>	so that the tool won't report that kind of changes anymore
Sep 05 14:50:01 <Dodji>	but I need to start with some sensible defaults :-)
Sep 05 14:50:36 <Dodji>	so for libwebkitgtk, the default is going to be "drop functions that don't start with 'webkit_' :-)
Sep 05 14:50:38 <Dodji>	"
Sep 05 14:50:45 <Dodji>	I hope that is going to be sensible enough.
Sep 05 14:50:50 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: thank you a lot
Sep 05 14:50:52 <mcatanzaro>	Dodji: What else is getting exported?
Sep 05 14:50:59 <Dodji>	man, a lot of stuff :-)
Sep 05 14:51:08 <mcatanzaro>	:(
Sep 05 14:51:08 <Dodji>	(in webkit-1.0)
Sep 05 14:51:21 <Dodji>	there are even c++ functions in the WTF:: namespace that are exported
Sep 05 14:51:31 <Dodji>	geoclue stuff
Sep 05 14:51:43 <mcatanzaro>	Anything C++ being exported is definitely a bug :D
Sep 05 14:51:53 <mcatanzaro>	Anyway, we have a different build system now, maybe that's cleaned up... maybe.
Sep 05 14:52:33 <Dodji>	I'll keep you posted about what I find :-)
Sep 05 14:52:57 <Dodji>	<mcatanzaro> It looks smart!
Sep 05 14:52:59 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: thanks!
Sep 05 15:05:16 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: btw, the task that performs the ABI verification in Fedora is https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Taskotron/Tasks/abicheck
Sep 05 15:05:23 <mcatanzaro>	Taskotron!
Sep 05 15:05:40 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: when the support for webkit is done, you can opt-in, asking for webkit-based stuff to be abi-verified too.
Sep 05 15:06:28 <Dodji>	for now, there is a white list of packages that are abi-verified and webkit-based packages are not in the white list yet.
Sep 05 15:07:14 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: taskotron indeed :-) and there is a particular taskotron task that uses libabigail for abi comparison.
Sep 05 15:07:49 <Dodji>	if we can handle webkit, chances are that we can handle any library out there ;-)
Sep 05 15:08:52 <mcatanzaro>	Famous last words :P
Sep 05 15:08:54 <Dodji>	I'll have to handle qtwebkit too, sorry. :-)
Sep 05 15:37:43 <annulen>	Dodji: feel free to ping me if you need to know something about qtwebkit
Sep 05 15:49:14 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PWDXAEDWCST66E5B2WTYKSFH22CH56TQ/
Sep 05 15:50:53 <Dodji>	annulen: thanks!
Sep 05 15:55:13 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: is there any deadline when you need final release?
Sep 05 15:55:42 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: No, everything QtWebKit has been horrible for years, a little longer makes no difference
Sep 05 15:55:54 <mcatanzaro>	But sooner is better, of course-
Sep 06 02:57:10 <lantw44>	Can I propose https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/205341 to be merged for 2.14 branch here?
Sep 06 02:57:42 <lantw44>	It seems that I don't have permission to edit the wiki page ...
Sep 06 03:04:48 <KaL>	lantw44: added
Sep 06 03:05:23 <lantw44>	KaL: thanks!
Sep 06 06:33:20 <em->	I feel rather dumb because I keep forgetting: did I miss some flags to `webkit-patch upload` to add the bug number to changelogs when creating a new bug (with style-bot now complaining on bug #161622), or support for creating new bugs in  `webkit-patch upload` is not really functional? do you usually upload patches manually or just create the bug manually and then use `webkit-patch upload`?
Sep 06 06:34:34 <em->	oh, nevermind, https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115934
Sep 06 06:42:49 <annulen>	em-: I create bug, pass its number in prepare-Changelog -b, then commit to git and run webkit-patch upload -g. Is there more ergonomic way?
Sep 06 06:45:44 <philn>	i do a similar thing but using git-bz to upload the patch
Sep 06 06:51:52 <em->	annulen, webkit-patch seem to be able to create a bug itself if no bug already exist, but sadly it failed to update the changelogs with the newly created bug number
Sep 06 06:52:54 <em->	philn, mh, indeed I'm more comfortable with git-bz, but then I guess you'll need to manually set the "review?" tag on the patch, right?
Sep 06 06:55:02 <philn>	em-: yes, i use git-bz attach -n -e and uncomment the flags i need in the editor
Sep 06 06:55:53 *	philn added flags support in git-bz a few years back, heh :)
Sep 06 06:59:01 <em->	philn, ooh, shiny!
Sep 06 06:59:17 <philn>	http://git.fishsoup.net/cgit/git-bz/commit/?id=146ec9c0f35d8ea1494d3f400bffbd9fcde7f5d4
Sep 06 06:59:21 *	em- will try git-bz next time
Sep 06 07:10:57 <em->	philn, oh, wait, you mean that you create the bug separatedly, so git-bz would behave more or less the same than `webkit-patch upload`
Sep 06 07:11:33 <philn>	yes
Sep 06 08:48:14 <em->	thanks anyhow :)

Sep 08 09:41:04 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: hey :), fyi I got some working code shuffling clipboard management.
Sep 08 09:41:28 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho clipboard hero :)
Sep 08 09:42:00 <garnacho>	:), I've got a couple of questions though
Sep 08 09:43:10 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: do you know if I can pass enums through the .messages.in plumbing? assuming yes, where would you recommend to define those if they need to be visible all the way from Pasteboard to PlatformPasteboard?
Sep 08 09:43:31 <mcatanzaro>	Hmmmm, I will investigate
Sep 08 09:45:13 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: cheers :), right now I'm passing selection(primary/clipboard) and mimetype as strings, surely sounds like there's a better way when we expect a limited set for both
Sep 08 11:53:55 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: just attached the patch to get things going, feel free to chime in :)
Sep 08 11:54:04 <mcatanzaro>	Thanks garnacho!
Sep 08 11:54:12 <mcatanzaro>	I will look and try to find an answer for the enum issue
Sep 08 11:54:40 <mcatanzaro>	They probably get automatically serialized to ints, I would expect
Sep 08 11:58:14 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: yeah I'd assume so, I guess it's more about where can I put those so they are widely available with no layering violations
Sep 08 11:58:40 <mcatanzaro>	I'll think about it, KaL will probably know off the top of his head though
Sep 08 12:06:37 <KaL>	there's encodeEnum decodeEnum methods in Decoder/Encoder classes
Sep 08 12:07:11 <KaL>	I'll look at the patch tomorrow, too late for me today
Sep 08 12:42:46 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: Have you noticed that clicking the close button on a GtkNotebook can cause two tabs to close at once? As if the click is being registered twice. I think it's a recent regression, maybe in GTK+?
Sep 08 12:52:37 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: hmm, haven't seen that tbh
Sep 08 13:30:15 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: https://paste.gnome.org/pzuck4npy
Sep 08 13:30:32 <mcatanzaro>	You were probably using a release build? :)
Sep 08 13:31:08 <mcatanzaro>	It's m_clipboard, not m_gtkClipboard
Sep 08 13:31:18 <garnacho>	could well be
Sep 08 13:32:24 <mcatanzaro>	It's a good idea to use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug when developing, so you get asserts and debuginfo
Sep 08 13:32:46 <mcatanzaro>	We have debug fission now, so that doesn't make it super slow to build anymore
Sep 08 13:33:10 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: couldn't afford debuginfo on this laptop :), too little disk space and memory
Sep 08 13:33:17 <mcatanzaro>	OK
Sep 08 13:46:40 <mcatanzaro>	OK garnacho, next one: https://paste.gnome.org/pkqevjqsa
Sep 08 13:46:48 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder what a "key function" is
Sep 08 13:48:41 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho, I'm not sure what the error means, but the functions you added there should probably be pure virtual regardless, and I bet that would make it go away
Sep 08 13:49:23 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: hmm, I see this = 0; in the vfuncs for the other platforms
Sep 08 13:49:33 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: key function is a first virtual function in declaration
Sep 08 13:50:13 <mcatanzaro>	Ah yeah, so the problem is you didn't implement the functions, they all really do need to be pure virtual :)
Sep 08 13:50:16 <mcatanzaro>	that's the = 0
Sep 08 13:50:34 <annulen>	you can add implementation even for pure virtual function
Sep 08 13:50:38 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder why you were able to build it garnacho
Sep 08 13:50:43 <annulen>	to make vtable anchored
Sep 08 13:50:54 *	garnacho gets lost in c++ parlance :)
Sep 08 13:50:56 <mcatanzaro>	There's no point though, it's in a PLATFORM(GTK) guard
Sep 08 13:51:01 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: me too tbh
Sep 08 13:51:10 <garnacho>	thanks for spotting those
Sep 08 13:52:21 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: The = 0 requires subclasses to implement the function. It's like setting a pointer to
Sep 08 13:52:23 <mcatanzaro>	NULL
Sep 08 13:53:10 <annulen>	with difference that setting pointer to nullptr doesn't trigger any compilation errors when it's used :)
Sep 08 14:35:04 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: any more build errors? I applied the fixes locally and it (still) builds/runs fine here
Sep 08 14:35:19 <garnacho>	as soon as you confirm, I'll update the patch :)
Sep 08 14:35:36 <mcatanzaro>	No garnacho, I built it successfully. But I have to finish typing your review before I can switch to Wayland to test it. Almost done!
Sep 08 14:36:04 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: ah sure, no worries :)
Sep 08 14:37:11 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: known issue: pasting from primary into webkit is opted out in wayland, I've got https://paste.gnome.org/pciioqwm7 locally too
Sep 08 14:38:06 <garnacho>	but that's perhaps a too wide shot, doesn't tell much about the compositor actually implementing primary selection
Sep 08 14:38:42 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: Yeah, I changed that at the web engines hackfest a couple years ago, since Wayland didn't have primary selection at the time
Sep 08 14:39:54 <mcatanzaro>	I think it's probably fine to say it's always supported there... nothing horrible is going to go wrong if we do so, right?
Sep 08 14:40:20 <mcatanzaro>	It's not like GTK+ is going to somehow crash the compositor if the compositor doesn't support primary selection and we try to use the PRIMARY clipboard.
Sep 08 14:41:09 <mcatanzaro>	But yeah, it would be ideal to actually check whether it's really supported; we'd just want to cache the result there to avoid doing IPC every time that innocuous-looking function is called.
Sep 08 14:41:11 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: not like that, should double check what happens if you do gtk_clipboard_wait_for_contents() if there's no backing selection though
Sep 08 14:41:21 <mcatanzaro>	Oh
Sep 08 14:41:33 <mcatanzaro>	OK, I posted your review, gonna log into Wayland to try it now
Sep 08 14:44:01 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: I see (WebKitWebProcess:7437): Gdk-WARNING **: Wayland compositor does not support xdg_shell interface, not using Wayland display
Sep 08 14:44:08 <mcatanzaro>	Is that fallout from the xdg_shell version bump?
Sep 08 14:44:47 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: it is :(, gtk+ master just works (not sure if there was release in between)
Sep 08 14:45:07 <mcatanzaro>	I'll rebuild GTK+ then
Sep 08 14:47:00 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: Still seeing those warnings with GTK+ master
Sep 08 14:47:17 <mcatanzaro>	Clipboard works though :P
Sep 08 14:48:11 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: well, it should follow the same paths now on both x11/wayland :)
Sep 08 14:48:21 <garnacho>	I guess it's falling back to x11 if you get that warning though
Sep 08 14:49:22 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: I'm thinking, if you get that warning, it's perhaps that you already had gtk+ at xdg_shell v6 but mutter is still at v5?
Sep 08 14:49:48 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: Yes, I'm using mutter 3.20
Sep 08 14:50:18 <garnacho>	ah, looks like it then
Sep 08 14:50:28 <mcatanzaro>	When you said "Gtk+ master just works" I thought you meant it supported both versions, oh well
Sep 08 14:50:47 <mcatanzaro>	I'll try downgrading GTK+
Sep 08 14:52:06 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: I hear you, now that kde got xdg_shell v5 support :P
Sep 08 15:02:22 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: "pure virtual method was called" is a bad problem. I've looked over your patch and I don't see where the mistake is though
Sep 08 15:02:56 <mcatanzaro>	My guess is object slicing somewhere: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/274626/what-is-object-slicing
Sep 08 15:03:09 <mcatanzaro>	But I've never seen this error ever before
Sep 08 15:05:27 <mcatanzaro>	OK, with older GTK+ and actually using the Wayland backend now, it works. Great.
Sep 08 15:06:22 <garnacho>	yay :)
Sep 08 15:08:57 <mcatanzaro>	(The "pure virtual method called" is probably what's causing the "terminate called without active exception")
Sep 08 15:18:20 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: uhm... weird that those errors don't happen on MiniBrowser
Sep 08 15:18:33 <garnacho>	at least here
Sep 08 15:20:39 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: And they don't happen for me since I rebooted my computer. Quite strange.
Sep 08 15:20:54 <garnacho>	uh, indeed
Sep 08 15:20:59 <mcatanzaro>	I guess we can just ignore it until the next time they show up. Maybe not related to your patch at all....
Sep 08 15:21:10 <mcatanzaro>	It was happening for me in ephy tab at shutdown.
Sep 08 15:21:22 <mcatanzaro>	Great work fixing this btw, this will make a lot of people happy besides me :)
Sep 08 15:22:41 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: yw :), I'll stay second in queue :P
Sep 08 17:36:39 <zaitor>	garnacho: yay - patch working :-)
Sep 08 17:38:06 <garnacho>	zaitor: nice :), thanks for testing
Sep 08 17:38:25 <zaitor>	nah, thanks for producing it!
Sep 08 17:39:11 <zaitor>	that is one major roadblock for wayland by default removed, so good job
Sep 08 17:41:45 <garnacho>	cheers!

Sep 13 12:11:01 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: "When gtk_clipboard_set_with_data() success clearClipboardContentsCallback takes the ownership of data, so we leak it here."

Sep 16 03:45:33 <KaL>	tpopela, bertogg: current trunk doesn't build with gcc 4.9, would it be a problem for debian/fedora if we bump GCC requirements to 5?
Sep 16 03:46:12 <tpopela>	KaL, no problem for us on Fedora..
Sep 16 03:47:27 <tpopela>	KaL, we have 5.3.1 on F23 (the oldest supported release)..
Sep 16 03:47:56 <KaL>	cool
Sep 16 03:48:32 <tpopela>	KaL, do you have some bug with the issue mentioned?
Sep 16 03:48:46 <KaL>	not yet
Sep 16 03:49:01 <KaL>	or do you mean the gcc bug?
Sep 16 03:49:11 <KaL>	https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60511
Sep 16 03:49:38 <tpopela>	KaL, gcc bug is fine, thanks!
Sep 16 03:52:25 <tpopela>	KaL, btw do we have https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/205462 in 2.14? I'm curious how bad https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/205998 would be..
Sep 16 03:54:10 <KaL>	tpopela: yes, please add that one to the wiki

Sep 20 10:34:47 <mcatanzaro>	Hm, we have settings exposed for media stream and WebRTC, but not for plain old video playback
Sep 20 10:34:50 <mcatanzaro>	:(
Sep 20 10:35:11 <mcatanzaro>	I bet a patch exposing whatever setting you need in WebKitSettings would be welcome
Sep 20 10:35:34 <xjuan>	yes I am looking into it
Sep 20 10:40:03 <xjuan>	btw is there any replacement in webkit2gtk for the old create-plugin-widget signal?
Sep 20 10:40:15 <xjuan>	other than creating an actual plugin I guess
Sep 20 10:41:31 <mcatanzaro>	I don't think so, you can't use real GtkWidgets anymore at least
Sep 20 10:44:06 <xjuan>	that explains why its not implemented in the new API :D
Sep 20 10:45:24 <xjuan>	ok good, so I guess a plugin is the only option to handle a custom object element
Sep 20 10:51:40 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: One or two people have tried sending messages from the web process to the UI process and using that to draw widgets on top of the web view with GtkOverlay, so it's possible, but a bad idea as there's visible delays when scrolling
Sep 20 10:53:05 <annulen>	if npapi plugins work somehow, it should be possible to draw widgets in the same manner
Sep 20 10:53:37 *	annulen haven't investigated how npapi works in wk2 yet
Sep 20 10:57:25 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: NPAPI is drawn in the web process, you've no access to GTK+ stuff there
Sep 20 10:57:54 <mcatanzaro>	Also FYI: NPAPI plugins can't draw anything in Wayland, only plugins with no UI work
Sep 20 10:59:15 <xjuan>	I see, what about the new plugin api, PPAPI?
Sep 20 10:59:26 *	xjuan does not even know if that is supported in webkit2
Sep 20 10:59:51 <mcatanzaro>	That's Chrome-only
Sep 20 11:00:19 <mcatanzaro>	I doubt we'd ever support it, Apple would have to admit that Google did something well. And nobody wants to support plugins anymore.
Sep 20 11:01:10 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: there is https://github.com/i-rinat/freshplayerplugin
Sep 20 11:01:22 <annulen>	it's a translation layer between PPAPI and NPAPI
Sep 20 11:01:40 <annulen>	in theory we could integrate it deeper
Sep 20 11:07:21 <mcatanzaro>	I think we don't want to :P
Sep 20 11:07:53 <xjuan>	hehe right I do not want to be held accountable for bringing that up :P
Sep 20 11:08:32 <xjuan>	mcatanzaro, so are npapi plugin ever going to be supported in wayland?
Sep 20 11:10:12 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: They are already supported if they don't draw anything. Plugins that draw stuff can never be supported because it depends on X11 :P
Sep 20 11:11:13 <xjuan>	well I knew some plugins used xembed, but npapi plugins works on windows so...
Sep 20 11:11:56 <xjuan>	I would not expect X11 plugins to work, but a wayland npapi plugin should
Sep 20 11:12:53 <xjuan>	but yeah, who is going to write wayland NPAPI pluggins
Sep 20 11:12:54 <xjuan>	:D
Sep 20 11:25:21 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: I see you handled the Epiphany updates, thanks!
Sep 20 11:26:17 <mcatanzaro>	Your WebKit builds finished in koji so it should be possible to build the Epiphany updates now
Sep 20 11:27:03 <blino>	KaL_out: magomez: hi, that's weird, the gstreamer backend does not build anymore for me since the sharedDisplay changes

Sep 20 11:27:50 <magomez>	blino yes, I have that in my todo
Sep 20 11:28:09 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Are you working on GStreamerGL?
Sep 20 11:28:24 <blino>	mcatanzaro: yes, with WebKitForWayland
Sep 20 11:28:39 <blino>	BTW, we did a YouTube 360 demo at IBC on our set-top boxes
Sep 20 11:28:59 <blino>	thanks all for providing solid pieces for this :)
Sep 20 11:29:11 *	mcatanzaro wishes YouTube 360 worked in WebKitGTK+
Sep 20 11:29:21 <blino>	mcatanzaro: it does
Sep 20 11:29:31 *	mcatanzaro wishes he could play >360p YouTube video in WebKitGTK+
Sep 20 11:29:35 <magomez>	blino, just remove the const in MediaPlayerGStreamerBase.cpp at line 238
Sep 20 11:29:44 <blino>	magomez: ok, thanks
Sep 20 11:29:44 <mcatanzaro>	blino: It definitely does not, at least not in the current stable release?
Sep 20 11:30:10 <mcatanzaro>	I had to switch to Firefox to get this year's snoop dawg april fools joke to work.
Sep 20 11:30:34 <mcatanzaro>	*snoop dogg
Sep 20 11:31:10 <blino>	mcatanzaro: with the GPU-GPU WebGL patch I have pending (working on a resubmit after magomez review), that should be better
Sep 20 11:31:42 <mcatanzaro>	blino: It depends on GStreamerGL? (When will we be able to enable that?)
Sep 20 11:37:42 <blino>	mcatanzaro: not sure if GST_MAP_GL would work otherwise, but it will perform better if video frames come as GL textures
Sep 20 11:38:56 <magomez>	mcatanzaro VideoSinkGStreamer doesn't use opengl rendering anymore
Sep 20 11:39:25 <magomez>	that's only done with GStreamerGL enabled
Sep 20 11:40:37 <mcatanzaro>	magomez: Do you have any plans to enable GStreamerGL in WebKitGTK+? You've been working on it?
Sep 20 11:41:40 <magomez>	mcatanzaro I did some work, but not sure when it's gonna be enabled by default
Sep 20 11:42:01 <magomez>	maybe KaL or philn know better
Sep 20 11:42:16 <mcatanzaro>	magomez: I doubt KaL knows much about it, we rely on you to tell us when it's stable
Sep 20 11:42:25 <KaL>	indeed!
Sep 20 11:42:27 <mcatanzaro>	(you and philn)
Sep 20 11:42:49 <KaL>	I'm fine to enable it whenever you consider it's stable enough
Sep 20 11:43:14 <mcatanzaro>	Now would be a good time actually, at the start of the development cycle, rather than the end
Sep 20 11:43:16 <magomez>	I'll discuss it with philn then and come back to you ;)
Sep 20 11:43:54 <mcatanzaro>	Thanks
Sep 20 11:44:27 <mcatanzaro>	You need to be the ones to decide because you'll be getting the bug reports if you choose wrongly :P
Sep 20 11:44:48 <magomez>	lol :P
Sep 20 12:11:44 <blino>	mcatanzaro: I am running SnoopaVision in 1080s
Sep 20 12:13:09 <mcatanzaro>	blino: It is the best possible conference demo, no?
Sep 20 12:14:39 <blino>	SnoopaVision ? not so sure :)
Sep 20 12:14:59 <blino>	there are racing videos like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRTnWZxTeQs
Sep 20 12:15:15 <blino>	I think there is a Rihanna concert in 360 somewhere around on YouTube, can't find it right now
Sep 20 12:15:39 <mcatanzaro>	blino: In 2.12.5 it says "360° video playback is not supported on this browser."
Sep 20 12:16:17 <mcatanzaro>	And anything over 360p is unavailable, with a link to https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6322658?visit_id=1-636099849476989668-1699397936&p=missing_quality&rd=1
Sep 20 12:16:52 <blino>	here is my run command: ./Tools/Scripts/run-minibrowser --gtk --enable-write-console-messages-to-stdout=true --enable-mediasource=true --enable-webgl=true --user-agent "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3l6mM3qVzk&index=2&list=PLbpi6ZahtOH4TalzBzHHczrUgJL7vsDdG"
Sep 20 12:17:09 <blino>	build command is: ./Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --gtk --no-media-stream --cmakeargs="-DUSE_GSTREAMER_GL=ON"
Sep 20 12:17:59 <blino>	I am not sure why we need to force the user agent, from what I read in the (obfuscated) YouTube JS, it was supposed to already handle correctly the original agent
Sep 20 12:20:48 <mcatanzaro>	OK, so we need two build settings that are currently disabled, and a user agent hack, thanks
Sep 20 12:24:16 <blino>	mcatanzaro: aren't MSE and WebGL enabled in epiphany by default?
Sep 20 12:24:39 <mcatanzaro>	blino: WebGL is indeed, I misread it as GStreamerGL.
Sep 20 12:24:47 <mcatanzaro>	MSE is not, that's why we are stuck on 360p
Sep 20 12:25:11 <mcatanzaro>	You need an unsupported build flag to turn on MSE, -DENABLE_MEDIA_SOURCE=ON. philn taught me this yesterday :)
Sep 20 12:25:30 <annulen>	I think it's safe to enable it by default since it has runtime setting
Sep 20 12:25:35 <blino>	hmm, not, with build-webkit, maybe for the pure cmake build
Sep 20 12:25:47 <annulen>	--media-source
Sep 20 12:25:50 <mcatanzaro>	Yeah, build-webkit enables experimental features, you don't want to use that in production
Sep 20 12:41:34 <blino>	mcatanzaro: not sure how we can avoid the user agent hack, we could try to contact someone at YouTube to get more details
Sep 20 12:42:53 <mcatanzaro>	blino: It's probably hopeless, we'll just always send Chrome to youtube.com
Sep 20 12:43:05 <mcatanzaro>	I'm going to do this for all Google domains anyway
Sep 20 12:43:07 <mcatanzaro>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142074
Sep 20 12:43:29 <mcatanzaro>	I'll try to deal with that next week-
Sep 20 12:46:14 <annulen>	oh, I wasn't aware that youtube requires ua hacks
Sep 20 15:53:53 <rave_>	If I load a blank error page or anything, just running the gtklauncher takes more than 100MB of RAM
Sep 20 15:54:03 <rave_>	does anybody know what could be the reason?
Sep 20 16:41:44 <mcatanzaro>	rave_: gtklauncher isn't supported anymore, time to move on to WebKit2....
Sep 20 16:49:14 <zaitor>	Hi upstream, I got no idea how to file this bug, so I'm just going to give you a screenshot
Sep 20 16:49:26 <zaitor>	https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Ed7A63EN/Skjermdump%20fra%202016-09-20%2022-47-56.png
Sep 20 16:49:54 <zaitor>	both evolution and epip does this when in wayland
Sep 20 16:50:50 <rave_>	mcatanzaro: oh ok but we are still using it... not sure if anybody knows the legacy system?
Sep 20 16:51:26 <mcatanzaro>	Hm zaitor, I just told DimStar in #gnome-hackers that it looked like a WebKit bug, but that doesn't look like a WebKit bug at all
Sep 20 16:51:33 <mcatanzaro>	(now that I see your screenshot)
Sep 20 16:52:21 <mcatanzaro>	Well maybe
Sep 20 16:53:12 <rave_>	mcatanzaro: it is not related to gtklauncher, even if I use bare minimum API the lib takes too much of RAM
Sep 20 16:53:21 <zaitor>	All I can say is that it's just evo and epip showing the behavior yet - granted they may only be the "messengers"
Sep 20 16:53:39 <rave_>	even with cache model set to DOCUMENT_VIEWER
Sep 20 16:53:41 <mcatanzaro>	Not other WK2 apps? Not yelp?
Sep 20 16:53:47 <zaitor>	let me try
Sep 20 16:53:50 <rave_>	even with no page loaded
Sep 20 16:54:02 <DimStar>	yelp does it too
Sep 20 16:54:05 <zaitor>	yelp does the same indeed
Sep 20 16:54:12 <zaitor>	and DimStar beat me to it
Sep 20 16:54:42 <DimStar>	zaitor: :) sorry - I did not find the channel (I missed the '+' in the name at first)
Sep 20 16:54:49 <mcatanzaro>	rave_: See https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/01/on-webkit-security-updates/ for why it's a bad idea to be using WebKit1 almost three years after it was discontinued
Sep 20 16:55:28 <mcatanzaro>	DimStar, zaitor: It's either mutter or WebKit, I dunno which. Do you know if WebKitGTK+ 2.13.92 or 2.13.91 worked properly?
Sep 20 16:55:31 <DimStar>	note: there are also messages on CLI: Error sending IPC message: Broken pipe
Sep 20 16:55:38 <zaitor>	check out the "cool" area on overview - maybe that is a hint https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/OCacWaGm/Skjermdump%20fra%202016-09-20%2022-54-34.png
Sep 20 16:56:20 <zaitor>	also note how epip and evo is overlapping
Sep 20 16:56:26 <DimStar>	mcatanzaro: I'm pretty sure I did not see this with 2.13.92 (I was just going to rebuild .92 and retest.. just building webkit is not 'just' done)
Sep 20 16:57:01 <mcatanzaro>	zaitor: Good find. Let's start with mutter, it shouldn't be doing that even if WebKit is broken somehow. And DimStar thinks WebKit 2.13.92 was OK, and not much happened in WebKit since then.
Sep 20 16:57:17 <mcatanzaro>	CC me and cgarcia please
Sep 20 16:58:08 <DimStar>	mcatanzaro: at least webkit's NEWS has some interesting changes regarding wayland, like: Use gdk_cairo_draw_from_gl() when possible in Wayland to render
Sep 20 16:58:22 <zaitor>	ah yes, this is wayland only btw
Sep 20 16:58:28 <zaitor>	x11 is fine for the same
Sep 20 16:58:53 <mcatanzaro>	Changes in WebKit are here: http://trac.webkit.org/log/releases/WebKitGTK/webkit-2.14
Sep 20 16:59:31 *	zaitor looks at mcatanzaro: Not much happend...
Sep 20 16:59:54 <zaitor>	:-)
Sep 20 17:00:10 <mcatanzaro>	Well maybe r206045 or r206080 :)
Sep 20 17:00:31 <mcatanzaro>	That really is not much for a WebKit release :P
Sep 20 17:00:49 <zaitor>	hehe :-) active bunch you are /yoda mode off
Sep 20 17:02:26 <mcatanzaro>	Just make sure you have a bug on one Bugzilla or the other, cgarcia on CC, screenshots attached; someone smarter than me will need to sort it out!
Sep 20 17:03:15 <DimStar>	zaitor: can you file the bug? I'm just trying to rebuild .92; then we can at least conclusively say that this alone would or would not be the cause
Sep 20 17:08:23 <DimStar>	I still had some 2.13.91 binaries of webkitgtk around: with those, yelp and evo behave as expected
Sep 20 17:14:40 <mcatanzaro>	http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/206045 had to do with scaling factor
Sep 20 17:16:44 <DimStar>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162317 - we have a basic bug where we can start adding details as we find them

Sep 22 09:38:47 <annulen>	blino: I haven't investigated GstGL in Qt port yet, on my devices there's no use for it as STBs have hardware blending for video & UI layers, and on desktop it has okayish performance already
Sep 22 09:39:48 <blino>	ok
Sep 22 09:44:51 <blino>	KaL: for WebKitForWayland, I still think it would be useful to have both gst-gl path and HOLE_PUNCH_GSTREAMER path at the same time, but maybe it's specific to WPE
Sep 22 09:45:53 <KaL>	yes, as long as we don't have punch hole upstream it's specific to wpe
Sep 22 09:48:46 *	annulen wonders about https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157314 progress
Sep 22 09:56:33 <blino>	annulen: it is being done in WebKitForWayland
Sep 22 09:57:51 <annulen>	I'd preffered to get such things from trunk, but I'll check there, thanks
Sep 22 09:59:20 <philn>	annulen: it will land in trunk "soon"
Sep 22 09:59:27 <blino>	:)
Sep 22 10:00:12 <blino>	what is the most advanced branch now regarding MSE? wpe-media in WebKitForWayland repo or wpe-staging in the Metrological one? or are they similar now wrt MSE?
Sep 22 10:00:21 <annulen>	well, eocanha told me that it was already working in May :)
Sep 22 10:00:47 <philn>	blino: i'm lost in the branches, zdobersek should know
Sep 22 10:02:33 <zdobersek>	they should be identical in terms of behavior
Sep 22 10:03:20 *	blino is waiting for the next big bang in Metrological repo, when you will update to a newer WebKit snapshot
Sep 22 10:03:32 <zdobersek>	https://github.com/eocanha/webkit/tree/mse-backport-rebased-20160916 is going upstream
Sep 22 10:03:52 <blino>	I think there will be no hope anymore for the C++14 revert hacks at next WebKit rebase
Sep 22 10:04:50 <mcatanzaro>	Yeah good luck with that, you guys haven't upgraded to GCC 4.9 yet? I'm intent on continuing to support 4.9 but the 4.8 ship sailed long ago
Sep 22 10:06:12 <philn>	mcatanzaro: some antique MIPS-based hardware product still uses it
Sep 22 10:06:44 <annulen>	AFAIK broadcom provides only 4.8
Sep 22 10:06:49 <blino>	yep
Sep 22 10:06:50 <annulen>	need to build my own toolchain
Sep 22 10:07:08 <blino>	we are actually waiting for the chipset vendor to provide an "official toolchain" updated to >= 4.8, to get "official support"
Sep 22 10:07:25 <blino>	philn: ARM-based as well
Sep 22 10:07:37 <annulen>	same here but probably hopeless
Sep 22 10:07:44 <blino>	it's roughly the same BSP for MIPS and ARM at Broadcom
Sep 22 10:08:07 <annulen>	and codesourcery toolchain requires mips32r2 minimum
Sep 22 10:08:16 <blino>	annulen: I did a try with crosstool-NG, maybe it's what we'll use in the end for ARM
Sep 22 10:08:30 <blino>	with gcc >= 5.0
Sep 22 10:08:45 <blino>	a crosstool-NG with clang would be good as well, not sure if it is being worked on
Sep 22 10:09:16 <annulen>	I'm afraid it will miscompile kernel or broadcom's code
Sep 22 10:09:28 <blino>	I think we would use that only for WebKit
Sep 22 10:09:54 <annulen>	I also doubt it will optimize better
Sep 22 10:13:02 <annulen>	using clang with libstdc++ 4.8 won't work as it lacks needed c++14 library features
Sep 22 10:18:31 <blino>	yep, it would require libc++
Sep 22 11:47:45 <blino>	danw: hi, any hope to get the tls split branch merged in libsoup? it would be great to have the grounds for an openssl backend
Sep 22 11:48:37 <danw>	you mean glib-networking, not libsoup... um, yeah, i need to deal with that
Sep 22 11:50:53 <mcatanzaro>	danw: hi, any hope you'll find time to review kekun's HSTS patch? (I'll probably wind up trying to update and land it sooner or later.)
Sep 22 11:51:07 <mcatanzaro>	That's actually libsoup!
Sep 22 11:51:58 <danw>	mcatanzaro: my primary goal for libsoup and glib-networking for the next release cycle is to find new maintainers for them
Sep 22 11:52:29 <danw>	(this was also my primary goal for the *last* release cycle, i was just really lame about it...)
Sep 22 11:52:38 <mcatanzaro>	OK
Sep 22 12:11:02 <blino>	danw: yes, sorry, I meant glib-networking
Sep 22 12:12:01 <blino>	danw: my final goal is to be able to use hardware-specific openssl engines in WebKitForWayland
Sep 22 12:39:48 <blino>	KaL: I think I'll have a follow-up patch to handle the flipY case in copyVideoTextureToPlatformTexture()
Sep 23 09:36:05 <blino>	zdobersek: it seems that when we stop WPE with C-c (SIGINT) from a terminal, SIGINT is received by all the process group (UIProcess, WebProcess, NetworkProcess), and that there is no proper termination handling in WebProcess, thus our MediaPlayerPrivate and our gstreamer elements are not cleaned up properly, which exposes driver issues
Sep 23 09:36:16 <blino>	is this supposed to be terminated properly with SIGINT?
Sep 23 09:47:02 <zdobersek>	blino: SIGINT propagates to children, and that's probably fine
Sep 23 09:47:29 <zdobersek>	blino: the proper approach would be to handle SIGINT in the UIProcess and terminate that process cleanly
Sep 23 09:50:28 <blino>	but SIGINT will still propagate to children first, no?
Sep 23 09:59:11 <zdobersek>	yeah, that's the case
Sep 23 10:00:49 <blino>	so even if we handle SIGINT properly in the UIProcess to terminate children cleanly, they will likely be already gone because of SIGINT
Sep 23 10:01:26 <annulen>	handle SIGINT in WebProcess
Sep 23 10:03:53 <blino>	yes, we can do that
Sep 23 10:11:20 <zdobersek>	yeah, that seems most appropriate
Sep 23 10:11:38 <zdobersek>	in WebProcessMain::platformInitialize(), before anything starts
Sep 23 10:13:28 <blino>	using g_unix_signal_source_new() ?
Sep 23 10:14:47 <zdobersek>	that may be an overkill
Sep 23 10:15:10 <zdobersek>	it should be fine to just define the handler via g_unix_signal_add()
Sep 23 10:15:32 <zdobersek>	as long as the intent is to just suppress the signal
Sep 23 10:16:24 <zdobersek>	and it should be fine not to manage the lifetime of the source since it's a single source that's meant for the lifetime of the process
Sep 23 12:04:58 <blino>	KaL: I've added support for flipY (used by THREE.js) in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162491
Sep 23 15:44:18 <rave>	does anybody knows if webkitgtk suports vsync ?
Sep 23 15:44:23 <rave>	for Webgl Animations
Sep 23 16:14:28 <rave>	anybody >?

Sep 27 09:25:50 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: tpopela: KaL: kov: annulen: Sorry for disappearing yesterday! It kept freezing my system with very high I/O, and it was already quite late so I gave up and went away.
Sep 27 09:25:53 <rishi>	Let me try now.
Sep 27 09:26:47 <tpopela>	rishi, we think that we have now fixes for all issues..
Sep 27 09:44:05 <rishi>	tpopela: kov: It works fine with WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1.
Sep 27 09:44:21 <rishi>	Ok. Let me know if you want me to test anything.
Sep 27 09:48:12 <kov>	rishi, can you test with a previous version of webkitgtk4 maybe?
Sep 27 09:49:35 <rishi>	kov: I was using webkitgtk4-2.12.5 on this F23 machine without any problems before.
Sep 27 09:52:34 <mcatanzaro>	Ideally we would have a test package with carlos's recent xsync fix
Sep 27 09:54:03 <kov>	mcatanzaro, which one is that?
Sep 27 10:04:56 <mcatanzaro>	kov: http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/206305
Sep 27 10:05:28 <mcatanzaro>	You suggested that might be to blame for rishi's issue, right? I am not sure why....
Sep 27 10:05:53 <kov>	I didn't, I didn't know about that issue, probably someone else
Sep 27 10:06:14 <kov>	mcatanzaro, so rishi is on X, right?
Sep 27 10:06:23 <mcatanzaro>	Um I dunno, rishi?
Sep 27 10:06:28 <mcatanzaro>	I guess so, it's F23
Sep 27 10:06:30 <rishi>	Yes, X.
Sep 27 10:06:48 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: tpopela suggested it.
Sep 27 10:06:49 <kov>	that fix is for X, anyway =)
Sep 27 10:06:51 <rishi>	<tpopela> rishi, mcatanzaro that X error should be the one fixed by KaL
Sep 27 10:08:29 <kov>	\o/ let's see if it works

Sep 28 11:22:58 <danw>	KaL: (sorry, didn't notice your response earlier). i was being unclear. I meant, I think that if you don't skip to the end of the input stream before closing it, then libsoup won't read in the response body, and so as a result, it will have to close the HTTP connection rather than being able to reuse it
Sep 28 11:24:17 <KaL>	danw: np, ah, I see
Sep 28 11:25:16 <KaL>	danw: I wonder if we can skip synchronously now in the network process
Sep 28 11:26:03 <danw>	in any sane case you'd be able to, but it's theoretically possible for the response to have a very large body

Sep 28 15:31:36 <L1pe>	hi guys
Sep 28 15:31:55 <L1pe>	I have a question about touch events for webkit 2 > 2.10
Sep 28 15:32:28 <L1pe>	How can I disable the "scroll behavior" when dragging on a touchscreen?
Sep 28 16:25:25 <L1pe>	I never get the touchend event :(
Sep 29 06:13:47 <mcatanzaro>	KaL, zdobersek: A couple more patches left in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142074
Sep 29 06:35:15 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: what do you think about port-independent collection of UA hooks? at least as a kind of "hall of shame" for website makers
Sep 29 06:35:38 <annulen>	not necessary as a code, maybe just wiki page
Sep 29 06:35:47 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Actually somebody else asked me to make UserAgentGtk port-independent yesterday
Sep 29 06:36:09 <mcatanzaro>	The plan is to rename it to UserAgent.cpp since there's not actually anything GTK-specific in there
Sep 29 06:36:25 <mcatanzaro>	But I have three remaining patches that KaL or zdobersek need to r+ before I will move the file ;)
Sep 29 06:36:30 <annulen>	cool
Sep 29 06:36:36 <mcatanzaro>	Then different ports can use it or not as they please
Sep 29 09:25:33 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, Hi Michael.. So the build is caused because I accidentally removed that define that in mentioned on the end of https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72099#c26 .. But the thing is that like KaL I'm not sure why it is there at all.. Isn't that sendContextMenuEventForKey() is missing WEBKIT_EXPORT? So the linker can't find it? But it is probably missing it on purpose as they don't want to expose it, thus there's need to be a
Sep 29 09:25:33 <tpopela>	COCOA guard..
Sep 29 09:26:10 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: If you need it in WebKit2 then you can add WEBCORE_EXPORT
Sep 29 09:28:03 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, but the reason is whether we want to..
Sep 29 09:28:30 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, are they applying some filters later as what to expose outside the shared library?
Sep 29 09:29:11 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: I presume so. You can definitely use whatever WebCore symbols you need.
Sep 29 09:29:42 <tpopela>	ok I will export it..
Sep 29 09:41:18 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, btw you didn't have any objections about centering the context menu yesterday ;)
Sep 29 09:43:04 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, btw do you know what's this? https://git.gnome.org/browse/webkitgtk-tarball-releases/
Sep 29 11:11:21 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: I did, but you were very focused on KaL's monitor :P
Sep 29 11:11:45 <mcatanzaro>	I don't know what that is, certainly it's obsolete.
Sep 29 11:13:43 <annulen>	I guess it's lightweight repo for those who don't want to clone whole webkit, I maintain similar for qtwebkit (though it has more snapshots than just releases)
Sep 30 11:24:03 <msanchez>	kov, philn: around?
Sep 30 11:26:41 <msanchez>	or yoon, whoever understands how the GStreamerGL stuff works, really :)
Sep 30 11:27:02 <msanchez>	My question is how this is supposed to work:  m_glDisplay = GST_GL_DISPLAY(gst_gl_display_egl_new_with_egl_display(downcast<PlatformDisplayWayland>(sharedDisplay).native())); (in https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/master/Source/WebCore/platform/graphics/gstreamer/MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase.cpp#L271)
Sep 30 11:27:11 <msanchez>	 
Sep 30 11:27:59 <msanchez>	gst_gl_display_egl_new_with_egl_display() expects an EGLDisplay (yes, even if the doc says something about an X11 display), but that .native() call returns an wl_display*. Am I missing something?
Sep 30 11:28:29 <msanchez>	Turns out that I make a similar mistake for the X11 path the other day (reason for bug 162669), that's why I noticed
Sep 30 11:28:31 <msanchez>	any idea?
Sep 30 13:02:23 <msanchez>	In case anyone is interested, I published some comments on cross-building for ARM, based on what I did during the web engines hackfest:
Sep 30 13:02:24 <msanchez>	https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/BuildingGtk#CrossCompilingforARMdevices
Sep 30 13:04:29 <annulen>	msanchez: CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON is excessive as anyone can use make VERBOSE=1
Sep 30 13:04:35 <annulen>	when needed
Sep 30 13:05:24 <msanchez>	Probably, this is what I used for myself, but it's probably too much. I'll remove it
Sep 30 13:05:53 <msanchez>	ha, turns out I remove it from the README.md in the repo already
Sep 30 13:14:41 <annulen>	msanchez: -O0 for development, srsly? you must have fast hardware
Sep 30 13:15:07 <annulen>	I prefer O2 for debug instead
Sep 30 13:17:27 <msanchez>	annulen: yes, it's fast hardware, and when I build for ARM I normally want to be able to debug later, that's why I put that
Sep 30 13:17:59 <msanchez>	granted, this is just a recipe coming out of my particular personal use, but as I haven't found anything like this I thought I'd better share what I have. People can adapt
Sep 30 13:18:30 <msanchez>	I'm happy to put -O2 or even -O3 for the release flags though, for the more general case
Sep 30 13:22:23 <msanchez>	annulen: fixed, thanks
Sep 30 13:22:50 <msanchez>	you can pass CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG anyway
Sep 30 13:24:31 <msanchez>	if you try it, please let me know. It definitely worked and saved me a ton of time but I'm sure it's not perfect :)
Sep 30 13:57:13 <msanchez>	off for the weekend, cheers

Oct 04 11:38:21 <philn>	blino: i don't know
Oct 04 11:38:37 <philn>	not really familiar with WebCrypto, why do you ask me? :)
Oct 04 11:39:05 <blino>	philn: because you have been the reviewer :)
Oct 04 11:39:40 <philn>	huh, i forgot about this then :)
Oct 04 11:41:12 <annulen>	blino: I had webcrypto/openssl on my roadmap, but wouldn't mind if you take this :)
Oct 04 11:41:22 <annulen>	s/had/have/
Oct 04 11:41:32 <blino>	philn: ok, I am asking because gnutls pulls gmp/nettle, and the newer versions are LGPLv3, which is avoided if possible in most embedded devices, I think many WPE users would be annoyed
Oct 04 11:41:44 <blino>	annulen: ah, so that's not such a bad idea :)
Oct 04 11:42:19 <philn>	blino: right, iirc in buildroot the last "usable" version of nettle is now hardcoded
Oct 04 11:42:24 <blino>	annulen: it seems Source/WebCore/crypto/gnutls/ is mostly notImplemented(), and Source/WebCore/platform/crypto/gnutls/CryptoDigestGnuTLS.cpp not so complicated
Oct 04 11:42:57 <blino>	so, I don't get why there are 2 different directories for that
Oct 04 11:42:57 <annulen>	I know
Oct 04 11:43:48 <annulen>	CryptoDigest is required for CSP
Oct 04 11:46:10 <blino>	annulen: ok, I'll keep you posted if I start working on this
Oct 04 11:47:03 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, Hi Michael would you mind to look again on https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72099 ?
Oct 04 11:49:16 <annulen>	blino: thanks!
Oct 04 11:52:21 <blino>	annulen: looks like it's mostly about doing this: https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Manual:EVP_DigestInit%283%29#EXAMPLE
Oct 04 11:52:46 <blino>	zdobersek: would it be ok to add an OpenSSL backend for WebCrypto Digest ? did you have such a request from WPE users?
Oct 04 11:53:15 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Why would that possibly be desired?
Oct 04 11:53:36 <mcatanzaro>	I don't think we want to depend on OpenSSL unless there's a strong reason why GnuTLS is unsuitable for you.
Oct 04 11:53:48 <annulen>	blino: I have digest implemented with Qt already, so I'm looking for AES/RSA in the first place
Oct 04 11:54:35 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: I think you need a WK2 owner for that now, right?
Oct 04 11:55:02 <blino>	mcatanzaro: because of LGPLv3 license of newer nettle/gmp releases which are required by gnutls, otherwise we are stuck with extremly old releases
Oct 04 11:55:20 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, hmmm I'm not sure.. but probably because of that WEBKIT_EXPORT thing - yes..
Oct 04 11:56:26 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Did you change any code in WebKit2 outside of platform ifdefs?
Oct 04 11:56:50 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, yes I did..
Oct 04 11:57:20 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: I would ask KaL to recommend the best owners to bug for review. This can be hard sometimes. :(
Oct 04 11:57:55 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos, any suggestions^?
Oct 04 11:59:46 <blino>	mcatanzaro: I am not saying that the GnuTLS backend should be removed from WebKitGTK+, but an additional OpenSSL backend would be useful for embedded devices, besides the licensing issues, there are some chipset vendors that provide hardware acceleration through an OpenSSL engine
Oct 04 11:59:48 <mcatanzaro>	blino: OK I see the problem, the license of GMP is LGPLv3+ OR GPLv2+. I think we decided it wasn't a problem in the past because it was only used in glib-networking which was a loadable module.
Oct 04 12:00:25 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: This is a very major problem, I think we should not do any more releases until we figure out how to fix this. :/
Oct 04 12:00:42 <mcatanzaro>	(Because now it's linked directly to WebKit, not indirectly via glib-networking.)
Oct 04 12:01:03 <philn>	isn't the licensing issue present with nettle too?
Oct 04 12:01:13 <mcatanzaro>	It also means we have to remove the subtle crypto feature no matter what other considerations we have; we just can't use GnuTLS anymore
Oct 04 12:01:32 <mcatanzaro>	philn: I think so, but I didn't look it up; gmp is enough
Oct 04 12:01:42 <philn>	k
Oct 04 12:04:26 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: is web crypto even enabled in production builds?
Oct 04 12:04:31 <mcatanzaro>	blino: So this should be a new problem in 2.14. 2.12 should be good for you
Oct 04 12:05:22 <KaL>	tpopela: I'll try to take a look at it tomorrow, feel free to ping me
Oct 04 12:05:35 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: No, but it's a trap, we need to get rid of it. :( Anyway the major problem with 2.14 is crypto digests for CSP.
Oct 04 12:06:47 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: We can rewrite web crypto from scratch with OpenSSL if needed for a client. I guess that's the best approach to solve the crypto digest problem for 2.14, as well.
Oct 04 12:07:19 <KaL>	so the problem is that LGPLv3+ is not compatible with BSD?
Oct 04 12:07:50 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: WebKitGTK+ is LGPLv2+. The license is LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+, neither is compatible with LGPLv2+
Oct 04 12:08:28 <KaL>	doesn't the + includes the 3?
Oct 04 12:08:31 <zdobersek>	blino: haven't heard of such a request yet
Oct 04 12:08:35 <blino>	mcatanzaro: my final goal is WPE, so this will be a problem for me anyway :)
Oct 04 12:08:35 <mcatanzaro>	We'd have to relicense to LGPLv3+ to link to gmp or nettle, and we don't want to do that.
Oct 04 12:08:47 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: ^
Oct 04 12:08:58 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: IANAL, but I think you don't have to
Oct 04 12:09:20 <KaL>	I don't understand it, TBH
Oct 04 12:09:23 <annulen>	just whole work becomes LGPL3 if user enables gnutls support
Oct 04 12:09:35 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: I wish you were right, but I don't think so. :)  LGPLv3+ is GPLv3+ with a couple clauses removed.
Oct 04 12:10:25 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: (Yes, which is unacceptable to us, we don't want to change our license)
Oct 04 12:10:55 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: LGPLv2+ means that it can be use it terms of 3, no relicensing needed
Oct 04 12:11:23 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: We don't have to relicense any source files, but we do have to relicense WebKit as a whole, which we will not do. So got to either change crypto digests to not use GnuTLS (best solution), or else revert the CSP changes (don't want to do that either)
Oct 04 12:11:23 <annulen>	even if v3-only is incpompatible with v2-only (which I doubt because both are weak copyleft)
Oct 04 12:11:57 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: No, you have it backwards, we are LGPLv2+, to use a LPGLv3+ dependency we have to upgrade to LGPLv3+.
Oct 04 12:12:25 <mcatanzaro>	The + gives us the ability to choose to upgrade our license, but we have chosen to not do that!
Oct 04 12:13:27 <annulen>	nope, "+" gives sublicensee ability to upgrade license as well, e.g. to use gpl3 library and redistribute resulting binaries
Oct 04 12:15:11 <philn>	someone please call a lawyer
Oct 04 12:15:15 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: What you are missing is that it is not currently possible to use WebKitGTK+ under the terms of LGPLv2+, like we claim.
Oct 04 12:15:39 <annulen>	yep, that's true because of csp digest
Oct 04 12:15:45 <mcatanzaro>	Everything using WebKitGTK+ 2.14 has to be relicensed to either LGPLv3+ or GPLv3+, that's not acceptable to us or our customers
Oct 04 12:15:55 <mcatanzaro>	We don't need a lawyer, we just need to remove this dependency
Oct 04 12:16:02 <mcatanzaro>	(Thanks for drawing our attention to it, blino.)
Oct 04 12:16:52 <mcatanzaro>	"Everything using WebKitGTK+ 2.14 has to be relicensed to either LGPLv3+ or GPLv3+, that's not acceptable to us or our customers" <-- (not true, but LGPLv3+ imposes requirements that we don't want)
Oct 04 12:18:28 <blino>	mcatanzaro: sure, thanks for listening :)
Oct 04 12:25:50 <blino>	mcatanzaro: are you taking care of the issue or should we contribute on this?
Oct 04 12:26:09 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Help would be great
Oct 04 12:29:24 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Can you file a bug report please? CC Daniel Bates
Oct 04 12:31:38 <blino>	mcatanzaro: ok, will do
Oct 04 12:38:36 <clopez>	mcatanzaro: and why this is also not a problem with gmp -> gnutls -> glib-networking -> webkitgtk? everything would be lgplv3 (including webkit2gtk) in that case also, or i'm missing something?
Oct 04 12:41:17 <mcatanzaro>	clopez: For the case of pluggable modules like glib-networking, I don't know. I think FSF says this is intended to be disallowed, but not sure if any courts have agreed.
Oct 04 12:41:25 <annulen>	at least one can use it without https :)
Oct 04 12:42:30 <mcatanzaro>	And there is an OpenSSL backend for glib-networking on a sidebranch to solve this problem. If we ever decide to maintain glib-networking we can merge it to master
Oct 04 12:42:46 <clopez>	yes.. https://github.com/GNOME/glib-openssl
Oct 04 12:47:09 <blino>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib-networking/log/?h=wip/openssl
Oct 04 12:47:41 <blino>	two different implementations ?
Oct 04 12:47:56 <blino>	ah, no, just packaged separately?
Oct 04 12:50:19 <mcatanzaro>	blino: OpenSSL would work for Fedora because we use the system library exception to the GPL and declare OpenSSL a system library, but I'm not sure if all distributors would be comfortable with that. NSS is MPL, I have no clue if that's an option but I suspect not. Maybe we need to use BoringSSL? I hope we don't have to bundle that....
Oct 04 12:51:01 <annulen>	BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL, how can it solve any license issue?
Oct 04 12:51:31 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Hm, didn't know that
Oct 04 12:52:29 <annulen>	as for me, Qt already depends on OpenSSL for networking, so I have no additional issues :)
Oct 04 12:53:01 <mcatanzaro>	At least OpenSSL is "probably" OK
Oct 04 12:56:59 <mcatanzaro>	So blino, will you work on rewriting the crypto digests support to use OpenSSL instead? That seems more urgent than web crypto, which is a trap but at least disabled by default
Oct 04 12:58:51 <blino>	mcatanzaro: opened https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162913
Oct 04 12:59:23 <blino>	mcatanzaro: yes, will work on this, do you have any deadline in mind?
Oct 04 13:01:47 <mcatanzaro>	blino: This seems like an ASAP problem to me :(
Oct 04 13:22:12 <clopez>	mcatanzaro.. i think that using openssl is going to cause issues for any GPL
Oct 04 13:22:15 <clopez>	...
Oct 04 13:22:43 <clopez>	for any GPL program without the openssl exception using WebKitGTK+ on a system that has not declared openssl a system library
Oct 04 13:22:59 <clopez>	like debian ... https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2014/01/msg00205.html
Oct 04 13:26:20 <blino>	see also https://wiki.debian.org/gnutls3
Oct 04 13:27:53 <blino>	clopez: we could keep both backends and give distributors the choice
Oct 04 13:29:45 <clopez>	that would be ideal
Oct 04 14:01:02 <blino>	mcatanzaro: clopez : I have an early implementation on top of OpenSSL with LayoutTests/crypto/subtle/sha-512.html ok
Oct 04 14:01:12 <mcatanzaro>	:)
Oct 04 14:01:27 <blino>	will post tomorrow, it still needs some work in the build system
Oct 04 14:11:14 <kov>	o/ I got some reaaaaally weird rendering issues with this site, can anyone render it fine with latest webkit? http://www.electrode.io/
Oct 04 14:12:50 <kov>	seems like the tiles used to render the texmap backing store are shuffled heh
Oct 04 14:17:17 <mcatanzaro>	kov: It works fine for me in 2.12.5 but is broken in 2.14.0. Want to file a bug?
Oct 04 14:17:56 <kov>	mcatanzaro, I will, thanks!
Oct 04 14:57:31 <mcatanzaro>	clopez: I'm reading the Debian stuff
Oct 04 14:57:44 <mcatanzaro>	Even OpenSSL looks problematic, like you say :(
Oct 04 14:57:49 <mcatanzaro>	blino: ^
Oct 04 14:58:05 <mcatanzaro>	I don't know what we can use here.
Oct 04 15:03:15 <kov>	mcatanzaro, mrobinson, https://www.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2016/Program/rogovin_fast_ui_draw/
Oct 04 15:03:40 <kov>	looks relevant to our 'what about cairo-gl, and what about cairo itself?' discussions
Oct 04 15:03:46 <blino>	mcatanzaro: well, Qt5 are Chromium are using OpenSSL, and they did not have to change their license
Oct 04 15:04:13 <kov>	what a sucky name
Oct 04 15:04:21 <mcatanzaro>	blino: They're not using the GPL license; it's only problematic for dependencies of WebKit that are also GPL
Oct 04 15:04:26 <clopez>	mcatanzaro: openssl has plans to relicense to APL 2.0 that would fix the issue.. but there is no ETA for that (it may happen next year or in 10 years)
Oct 04 15:04:30 <mcatanzaro>	The problem is that the OpenSSL license is incompatible with the GPL
Oct 04 15:04:40 <clopez>	https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/08/01/cla/
Oct 04 15:04:50 <blino>	unless you consider it a system library?
Oct 04 15:05:20 <clopez>	yes.. there are only two ways forward... consider openssl a system library and use the gpl clausule about exceptions for system libraries
Oct 04 15:05:34 <clopez>	or add an extra clausule on the gpl program explicitily allowing the usage of openssl
Oct 04 15:05:44 <clopez>	more info: https://people.gnome.org/~markmc/openssl-and-the-gpl.html
Oct 04 15:06:07 <mcatanzaro>	clopez: Remember the Apache license is definitely incompatible with GPLv2; it would force GPLv2+ projects to upgrade to GPLv3+. We probably don't want to require that either.
Oct 04 15:06:48 <mcatanzaro>	It would be very difficult to add an openssl exception to a program like epiphany, it requires contacting hundreds of past contributors :(
Oct 04 15:07:09 <clopez>	mcatanzaro: epiphany is gpl?
Oct 04 15:07:14 <mcatanzaro>	clopez: Of course
Oct 04 15:07:23 <clopez>	then that is going to cause issue on debian if we link with openssl...
Oct 04 15:07:32 <mcatanzaro>	It's actually going to be upgraded to GPLv3+ anyway, but we don't want to force it on other applications
Oct 04 15:07:42 <blino>	clopez: Debian could stay on gnutls
Oct 04 15:08:04 <clopez>	that means that we would have two support an openssl and gnutls backend
Oct 04 15:08:19 <mcatanzaro>	blino: No, because we know gnutls is definitely a problem, we really need to remove the gnutls support....
Oct 04 15:09:20 <mcatanzaro>	We should investigate if we can depend on an MPL library (NSS)
Oct 04 15:09:20 <blino>	mcatanzaro: would Debian be annoyed to distribute WebKitGTK+ as LGPLv3+ ?
Oct 04 15:09:46 <annulen>	I think they are fine until they can distribute combined work reasonably
Oct 04 15:11:00 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Yeah, it would cause massive problems as LGPLv3+ is incompatible with GPLv2+.
Oct 04 15:11:13 <annulen>	it is incompatible with GPL2, not 2+
Oct 04 15:11:41 <annulen>	well, looks like you need to use libtomcrypt
Oct 04 15:11:58 <annulen>	I'll work on openssl anyway, but it will stay out of trunk in this case
Oct 04 15:12:20 <blino>	annulen: I already have an early OpenSSL backend for CryptoDigest
Oct 04 15:12:34 <blino>	annulen: but not for WebCrypto
Oct 04 15:14:15 <annulen>	blino: is openssl better for you than tomcrypt (e.g. your device already has openssl)? if yes, I think we could sharedly maintain code in trunk
Oct 04 15:14:16 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Please, remember that the + in GPLv2+ is an escape hatch, it's not automatic. To use an LGPLv3+ library you have to actually relicense your application from GPLv2+ to GPLv3+. (Not all of the code, but you need to update the COPYING file, about dialogs in GUI apps, printed statements in command line tools.) We can't require that of apps that use WebKit.
Oct 04 15:15:05 <blino>	annulen: yes, we already have openssl, and with a specific openssl engine for the chipset, I guess most WPE users will have it too
Oct 04 15:16:08 <mcatanzaro>	The advantage of using GPLv2+ is that anyone can unilaterally perform the relicensing without requesting permission from all copyright holders.
Oct 04 15:16:14 <mcatanzaro>	(relative to GPLv2 only)
Oct 04 15:16:37 <annulen>	or link with newer version of library that became LGPL3
Oct 04 15:17:22 <mcatanzaro>	Yes, we can use NSS
Oct 04 15:17:29 <mcatanzaro>	Wheeeeeeee, that is the best solution then
Oct 04 15:17:47 <blino>	probably not for WPE users :)
Oct 04 15:18:13 <blino>	I think an OpenSSL backend is fine for most embedded devices, and OpenSSL is usually already part of the platform
Oct 04 15:20:35 <mcatanzaro>	blino: But NSS works for Debian too, so it seems like a clearly better option, no? (From a licensing perspective. I don't actually know if it can do the things we need or not.)
Oct 04 15:21:33 <blino>	yep, from a licensing perspective, but I think WebKitForWayland users won't be really happy to pull it, it is less commonly used in embedded devices, and I am unsure about the footprint
Oct 04 15:21:49 <mcatanzaro>	Maybe we should just implement the hashes manually in WebKit. I wonder how hard it would be.
Oct 04 15:22:27 <mcatanzaro>	blino: FWIW all linux distros would be unhappy to add OpenSSL dependencies; even in Fedora where it is considered a system library, it has been recommended to not use it for a long time now
Oct 04 15:22:48 <annulen>	in this case you should better use tomcrypt, maybe bundle a part of it
Oct 04 15:22:50 <blino>	is there no standalone crypto lib abstraction?
Oct 04 15:22:56 *	mcatanzaro investigates tomcrypt
Oct 04 15:24:23 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Not yet
Oct 04 15:25:19 <mcatanzaro>	clopez: The Apache 2 license change will be a big problem too. If OpenSSL ever switches to that license, then nothing that uses GPLv2 will be able to use WebKit. Another reason to avoid depending on OpenSSL.
Oct 04 15:25:45 <mcatanzaro>	(we don't want to force applications to upgrade their licenses, it's not nice!)
Oct 04 15:28:08 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: if webkit has a choice between gnutls and openssl, each application has a sweet spot
Oct 04 15:28:26 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: And we have to have two different versions of WebKit installed on the system. No way!
Oct 04 15:28:28 <blino>	we need a glib-crypto :)
Oct 04 15:28:54 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: it's a distributor's business to deal with the problem
Oct 04 15:28:55 <mcatanzaro>	(annulen, that works for embedded systems with only one application, but not for Linux distros.)
Oct 04 15:30:02 <annulen>	they can ship two packages, they can add "system" exception, they can exclude packages which don't allow linking with lgpl3 from repos, etc.
Oct 04 15:30:13 <annulen>	it's their business, I think
Oct 04 15:30:46 <mcatanzaro>	(a) is unreasonable, (b) is something Debian has apparently already decided not to do, (c) is also unreasonable, we shouldn't do it
Oct 04 15:30:53 <blino>	see also https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:FAQ?rd=Licensing/FAQ#What.27s_the_deal_with_the_OpenSSL_license.3F
Oct 04 15:30:58 <blino>	they consider it a system library
Oct 04 15:31:37 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Yes, that's Fedora's interpretation; my understanding of the information clopez linked to is that Debian says it is not a system library, we care about Debian too....
Oct 04 15:31:48 <blino>	yes
Oct 04 15:32:27 <blino>	annulen: would libtomcrypt be sufficient to cover WebCrypto needs as well?
Oct 04 15:32:51 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Does libtomcrypt have any releases? Their website appears to be a blank page?
Oct 04 15:33:12 <annulen>	hm, it wasn't so
Oct 04 15:33:14 <mcatanzaro>	(We really don't want to bundle anything unless absolutely required.)
Oct 04 15:33:29 <annulen>	http://www.libtom.org/LibTomCrypt/
Oct 04 15:33:39 <mcatanzaro>	Error resolving 'www.libtom.org': No address associated with hostname
Oct 04 15:33:47 <mcatanzaro>	Strange
Oct 04 15:33:48 <annulen>	works here
Oct 04 15:34:00 <blino>	ok as well here
Oct 04 15:34:30 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: wait a minute, NSA surveillance is working hard to check if it's appropriate for you to see...
Oct 04 15:34:47 <mcatanzaro>	Well it's a DNS issue so it takes time to propagate; either it will be fixed for me tomorrow, or broken for you :)
Oct 04 15:35:23 <blino>	mcatanzaro: https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt/releases
Oct 04 15:35:46 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Six years ago? :(
Oct 04 15:35:49 <blino>	looks so
Oct 04 15:36:19 <mcatanzaro>	Are they not hosting any releases elsewhere?
Oct 04 15:36:32 <blino>	did not find much on the main page
Oct 04 15:36:41 <blino>	also, it is written in C, no ASM it seems
Oct 04 15:38:18 <annulen>	blino: fyi, some asm files in openssl are just results of .c compilation with selected set of options
Oct 04 15:41:01 <blino>	zdobersek: we should check with Metrological, maybe Albert has an opinion on this as well
Oct 04 15:42:36 <zdobersek>	it's probably not much different from yours
Oct 04 15:43:21 <blino>	I'd think so, but maybe they already have NSS around
Oct 04 15:44:30 <blino>	at least there's a buildroot package for libnss
Oct 04 15:46:22 <mcatanzaro>	NSS is hardly a more difficult dependency than the stuff we already require, but anyway. Forget about web crypto. That needs to be rewritten from scratch, doesn't matter for now. CryptoDigest is the urgent issue. It needs implementations of SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. NSS seems like overkill for these.
Oct 04 15:47:57 <mcatanzaro>	We could literally shell out to the coreutls sha*sum binaries to fix this. It sucks and we shouldn't, but it is an option.
Oct 04 15:48:59 <mcatanzaro>	We could fork the last GPLv2+ version of coreutils and steal code from there. We could try to write them ourselves (I dunno how hard it would be). All probably better options than OpenSSL?
Oct 04 15:49:26 <annulen>	if you look from viewpoint of debian maintainer, maybe
Oct 04 15:49:31 <blino>	GPLv2+? not really an option
Oct 04 15:49:40 <annulen>	they like to cripple software they ship
Oct 04 15:49:41 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Good point :)
Oct 04 15:50:36 <mcatanzaro>	blino: I think CryptoDigestOpenSSL.cpp might be fine for WPE, but not for GTK
Oct 04 15:51:16 <blino>	yes, it seems so
Oct 04 15:51:46 <blino>	would an OpenSSL backend be accepted upstream then? only when WPE gets merged?
Oct 04 15:52:07 <mcatanzaro>	blino: When WPE gets merged, yes
Oct 04 15:53:35 <blino>	on desktop, NSS is probably fine
Oct 04 15:59:49 <clopez>	mcatanzaro, blino.. would be Mozilla's NSS an option? their MPL 2.0 license don't seems to cause any issue with the LGPLv2+
Oct 04 15:59:55 <clopez>	or with the GPL
Oct 04 16:00:22 <mcatanzaro>	clopez: Yes, it is an option. All distros have it already so it is no problem to add it as a dep in 2.14.1.
Oct 04 16:00:29 <mcatanzaro>	We discussed it up above
Oct 04 16:00:33 <clopez>	i see
Oct 04 16:00:37 <mcatanzaro>	But blino thinks it might not be desirable for WPE
Oct 04 16:00:47 <mcatanzaro>	So we could use NSS for GTK but OpenSSL for WPE
Oct 04 16:01:37 <clopez>	maybe we need some abstractions that allow to select a different crypto library backend at build time
Oct 04 16:01:42 <gustavoz_>	mcatanzaro: libmhash maybe?
Oct 04 16:01:55 <blino>	mcatanzaro: clopez: we should check with other WPE users, my opinion is that OpenSSL is best suited, but I could be wrong
Oct 04 16:02:08 <clopez>	technically i think openssl is the best option
Oct 04 16:02:24 <blino>	clopez: or at runtime like glib-networking
Oct 04 16:02:28 <clopez>	the issue is with their license and GPL software that may use WebKit
Oct 04 16:02:36 <blino>	yep
Oct 04 16:03:45 <mcatanzaro>	clopez: I don't think we want to support multiple backends in the same port as it doesn't solve any problem
Oct 04 16:05:16 <blino>	mcatanzaro: tomorrow, I'll open sub-bugs : 1) make crypto backend configurable and gnutls optional, 2) propose an openssl backend that will likely not be merged yet
Oct 04 16:05:21 <blino>	how does that sound?
Oct 04 16:06:09 <clopez>	mcatanzaro: solves the problem that some people may want to use openssl because the hardware accelaration support that it has... and solves the problem that some people may forbid using it because of the license issues
Oct 04 16:06:35 <mcatanzaro>	blino: I don't think it should be configurable for GTK. It could be configurable for WPE, I don't know, but that would be a downstream thing until WPE is upstreamed.
Oct 04 16:07:44 <mcatanzaro>	clopez: NSS says it supports hardware accelerators, dunno how much extra work it would be to write a PKCS #11 module to use the accelerator, but it's possible at least: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/FAQ
Oct 04 16:08:45 <mcatanzaro>	Anyway, keep in mind this is just for CSP for now, so it's very unlikely to be performance critical, right?
Oct 04 16:09:26 <blino>	it involves hashing <script> sources, right?
Oct 04 16:09:53 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Good point
Oct 04 16:12:17 <blino>	we could consider http://www.saphir2.com/sphlib/
Oct 04 16:12:19 <mcatanzaro>	Anyway looking at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Reference it seems like NSS is too high-level
Oct 04 16:12:32 <blino>	(from the French government)
Oct 04 16:13:21 <blino>	but not much documentation and release info around
Oct 04 16:13:39 <mcatanzaro>	Well it's a copylib, so we don't need releases, we can just copy the functions we need, right?
Oct 04 16:13:56 <mcatanzaro>	The tarball is huge
Oct 04 16:14:25 <mcatanzaro>	Last release was 2011, not really a problem for something like this though
Oct 04 16:14:42 <mcatanzaro>	License is good...
Oct 04 16:15:19 <blino>	huge because of C + java + doc ?
Oct 04 16:15:24 <mcatanzaro>	Looks like it
Oct 04 16:15:54 <mcatanzaro>	It supports SHA1 and SHA2, not sure how those map to the bit sizes that we need but looks like not enough?
Oct 04 16:16:05 <blino>	maybe equivalent to libtomcrypt actually
Oct 04 16:16:36 <mcatanzaro>	OK, SHA2 = SHA-224 and SHA-256
Oct 04 16:16:41 <blino>	found it here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5670256/sha-512-source-code-in-c#comment9974432_5702480
Oct 04 16:16:46 <mcatanzaro>	But we also need SHA-384 and SHA-512
Oct 04 16:17:27 <gustavoz_>	anything against libmhash?
Oct 04 16:17:33 <gustavoz_>	it does support to sha512
Oct 04 16:18:12 <mcatanzaro>	gustavoz_: License is good but looks like it doesn't support SHA-128
Oct 04 16:18:23 <gustavoz_>	mcatanzaro: true
Oct 04 16:18:25 <mcatanzaro>	Ah it's just called SHA-1, nevermind
Oct 04 16:18:44 <mcatanzaro>	No release since 2008
Oct 04 16:18:51 <gustavoz_>	there's polarssl/mbedtls as well, but they're a mess, avoid them with a 10-foot pole
Oct 04 16:19:12 <mcatanzaro>	gustavoz_: polarssl/mbedtls isn't an option due to its licensing
Oct 04 16:19:15 <blino>	mcatanzaro: sphlib supports SHA-512 and SAH-394 as well
Oct 04 16:19:24 <blino>	384
Oct 04 16:19:28 <mcatanzaro>	Does it blino?
Oct 04 16:19:39 <gustavoz_>	mcatanzaro: well ABI/API is a mess that's never compatible among versions so it's pretty bad in that way to start with
Oct 04 16:19:46 <mcatanzaro>	Looks like Debian already has a libmhash package, that's good
Oct 04 16:20:05 <blino>	well, at least the java part :) looking into the C
Oct 04 16:21:02 <blino>	sha2big.c
Oct 04 16:21:20 <mcatanzaro>	"The authors of libmhash are Nikos Mavroyanopoulos and Sascha Schumann." <-- seems like GnuTLS stuff, what is the license I wonder?
Oct 04 16:21:42 <gustavoz_>	LGPLv2
Oct 04 16:22:07 <mcatanzaro>	OK, so looks like we have several options here
Oct 04 16:22:30 <blino>	mhash could be good if already packaged in most distros
Oct 04 16:22:42 <mcatanzaro>	blino: It's in Fedora too
Oct 04 16:22:55 <blino>	(and in Mageia)
Oct 04 16:23:27 <mcatanzaro>	And gentoo and arch and openSUSE, we are good
Oct 04 16:23:32 <mcatanzaro>	No need to bundle it
Oct 04 16:23:42 <mcatanzaro>	Last release was 2008 so it can't possibly be a problem for anyone
Oct 04 16:23:51 <mcatanzaro>	Just need to figure out how to use it....
Oct 04 16:26:24 <blino>	mcatanzaro: looks pretty similar to gnutls or openssl, not a surprise :)
Oct 04 16:27:30 <blino>	but the man only mentions SHA1 / SHA256
Oct 04 16:27:57 <blino>	cvs :)
Oct 04 16:28:01 <mcatanzaro>	2008
Oct 04 16:28:30 <mcatanzaro>	We should ask Nikos if it would be dumb to switch from GnuTLS to mhash (since he wrote both of them)
Oct 04 16:30:18 <clopez>	mcatanzaro: what about libgcrypt? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libgcrypt
Oct 04 16:30:25 <blino>	there is some maintenance in Debian : https://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=collab-maint/mhash.git
Oct 04 16:31:23 <blino>	clopez: appears to be LGPLv2.1
Oct 04 16:31:57 <clopez>	License: LGPL-2.1+
Oct 04 16:32:00 <clopez>	yes
Oct 04 16:32:17 <clopez>	i think that is ok for us, isn't it?
Oct 04 16:32:54 <blino>	and properly maintained
Oct 04 16:33:32 <blino>	with AArch64 optimizations
Oct 04 16:33:57 <zdobersek>	also covers ciphers and key algos that would be needed for webcrypto
Oct 04 16:34:15 <zdobersek>	and MACs
Oct 04 16:34:32 <zdobersek>	and doesn't have a 8-yo latest release
Oct 04 16:35:16 <blino>	API looks ok too: https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gcrypt-devel/Working-with-hash-algorithms.html#Working-with-hash-algorithms
Oct 04 16:35:26 <mcatanzaro>	clopez: I think we have a winner
Oct 04 16:35:36 <zdobersek>	does depend on libgpg-error
Oct 04 16:36:12 *	mcatanzaro not too worried about libgpg-error
Oct 04 16:36:21 <blino>	looks like a standalone lib
Oct 04 16:37:01 <blino>	clopez: thanks for saving us :)
Oct 04 16:37:01 <zdobersek>	it's a misc lib, LGPLv2.1
Oct 04 16:37:13 <clopez>	take into account that gnutls was using libgcrypt before, they dropped that backend because of performance issues
Oct 04 16:37:44 <clopez>	The Cryptographic library layer, currently supports only libnettle. Older versions of GnuTLS used to support libgcrypt, but it was switched with nettle mainly for performance reasons <--- https://www.gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Cryptographic-Backend.html
Oct 04 16:39:11 <blino>	maybe it has been fixed since then?
Oct 04 16:40:57 <clopez>	years ago i also patched aircrack-ng to use libgcrypt instead of openssl (to avoid this GPL-program-uses-openssl issue) on debian and i can confirm that its slower than openssl
Oct 04 16:41:09 <clopez>	not sure if it has improved over the years
Oct 04 16:41:35 <clopez>	here are more alternatives: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries
Oct 04 16:43:04 <clopez>	i guess that the only way to know if libgcrypt has improved is doing some benchmarks
Oct 04 16:44:08 <gustavoz_>	it's unlikely to have improved, several codepaths in openssl are asm-optimized, libgcrypt doesn't use asm optimizations
Oct 04 16:45:08 <gustavoz_>	i stand corrected, it has some small optimizations for x86 and arm only
Oct 04 16:45:55 <clopez>	https://www.gnupg.org/blog/20131215-gcrypt-bench.html
Oct 04 16:48:23 <mcatanzaro>	gcrypt seems best to me....
Oct 04 16:49:23 <zdobersek>	yep
Oct 04 16:51:39 <blino>	gustavoz_: they do have optims for ARM as well, for example http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libgcrypt.git;a=commit;h=595251ad37bf1968261d7e781752513f67525803
Oct 04 16:51:56 <blino>	gustavoz_: and AArch32 too, but pretty recent, see: http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libgcrypt.git
Oct 04 16:52:07 <clopez>	mcatanzaro: why best than NSS?
Oct 04 16:52:21 <blino>	gustavoz_: and ARM Neon too
Oct 04 16:52:50 <mcatanzaro>	clopez: I don't see that NSS supports any SHA hashes, it seems to be higher-level
Oct 04 16:56:56 *	mcatanzaro discovers wtf/SHA1.h
Oct 04 17:00:21 <blino>	and WebKitBuild/DependenciesGTK/Source/jhbuild/patches/libgcrypt-1.4.5-ImplicitDSOLinking.patch ?!
Oct 04 17:02:27 <mcatanzaro>	blino: I think that's a patch for GNOME jhbuild, not WebKit's :)
Oct 04 17:03:05 <mcatanzaro>	We've been trying to move the GNOME modulesets out of the jhbuild source tree for years, but it requires sysadmin support that has not been forthcoming ;(
Oct 04 17:03:06 <blino>	but could be interesting to know where it is used
Oct 04 17:04:02 <blino>	mayeb a remnant for old gnutls...
Oct 04 17:04:10 <mcatanzaro>	blino: It's unused, libgcrypt was moved to sysdeps at some point in the past
Oct 04 17:04:38 <mcatanzaro>	Well, it's probably used in some old GNOME release moduleset. People complain when I delete patches used by old modulesets, since the old modulesets still exist....
Oct 04 17:06:47 <blino>	see also https://www.gnupg.org/blog/20131215-gcrypt-bench.html
Oct 04 17:08:13 <clopez>	mcatanzaro: .. that seems to be very odd, i would bet they support it but probably their documentation sucks...
Oct 04 17:08:38 <clopez>	here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Overview its listed all the common hashing algorithms as something you can do with nss
Oct 04 17:08:48 <blino>	ext/hls/gsthlsdemux.h:#include <gcrypt.h>
Oct 04 17:08:52 <clopez>	and here is a sample code doing that https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_Sample_Code/NSS_Sample_Code_Sample_1_Hashing
Oct 04 17:10:01 <blino>	actually, gsthlsdemux supports all of OpenSSL + nettle + gcrypt!
Oct 04 17:13:09 <blino>	qemu also seems to move out of gnutls, with both nettle + gcrypt backends: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-06/msg00204.html
Oct 04 17:22:44 <mcatanzaro>	"Not only
Oct 04 17:22:46 <mcatanzaro>	were the GNUTLS hash APIs not added until GNUTLS 2.9.10" -- qemu devs, 2016
Oct 04 17:23:56 <blino>	yeah, I wonder what they target :)
Oct 04 17:25:44 <blino>	systemd uses gcrypt for dnssec
Oct 04 17:29:41 <blino>	regarding the WPE users, the RDK framework seems to use gcrypt for the tr69 stack, so I guess it's packaged there already
Oct 04 17:57:40 <mcatanzaro>	Let's go with gcrypt. blino, are you still interested it working on this, or are you satisfied with your code using OpenSSL?
Oct 04 18:05:10 <blino>	mcatanzaro: I can give it a try tomorrow, I will need to gather some benchmarks for these crypto backends anyway
Oct 04 18:06:20 <mcatanzaro>	Thanks!
Oct 04 18:42:18 <rave>	Does anybody know if v-sync was ever solved in webkit for linux ?
Oct 04 18:42:47 <rave>	WebGL + webkit + linux = BAD SCREEN TEARING
Oct 04 18:43:11 <rave>	requestAnimationFrame is not even waiting for driver sync ?
Oct 04 18:43:35 <mcatanzaro>	rave: I think all the people who can answer that are in Europe, so you might want to ask when Europeans are around on IRC. Or ask on the mailing list. Or file a bug report (seems like a bug, right?).
Oct 04 18:44:38 <rave>	mcatanzaro: hmm it does , but wanted to know if there is already a bug for this ?
Oct 04 18:44:46 <mcatanzaro>	I don't think so
Oct 04 18:45:16 <mcatanzaro>	If you file a bug, prefix the bug title with [GTK] and be sure to select the "Webkit Gtk" component
Oct 04 18:45:22 <mcatanzaro>	(otherwise it will go unnoticed)
Oct 04 18:45:38 <rave>	mcatanzaro: where is the bug repository ?
Oct 04 18:45:44 <mcatanzaro>	rave: bugzilla.webkit.org
Oct 04 18:46:22 <rave>	thanks, do u know which europian time zone they come in :P ? GMT + 5:30 ?
Oct 04 18:47:27 <mcatanzaro>	rave: Mostly Central European Daylight Time
Oct 04 18:48:12 <rave>	ok thanks

Oct 05 13:29:56 <rave>	WebGL + webkitgtk+ + linux = tearing
Oct 05 13:30:00 <rave>	and its really bad
Oct 05 13:30:09 <rave>	it doesn't sync with the driver
Oct 05 13:42:03 <blino>	mcatanzaro: I have a gcrypt implementation for CryptoDigest (CSP) + HMAC (SubtleCrypto), I think I'll be able to post it tomorrow
Oct 05 14:16:15 <mcatanzaro>	blino: :D
Oct 05 14:18:34 <mcatanzaro>	blino: We actually did more investigation and found that it's actually fine to link a LGPLv2+ library to an LGPLv3+ library, and since it's dual-licensed GPLv2+ that takes care of the GPL-compatibility issue. So it's not a problem for upstream, but it still makes sense to switch to gcrypt IMO, to be nice to embedders that don't want to comply with LGPLv3+.
Oct 05 14:58:00 <clopez>	mcatanzaro: "to be nice to embedders that don't want to comply with LGPLv3+"
Oct 05 14:58:01 <clopez>	lol :)
Oct 05 14:58:30 <clopez>	i hope RSM is not around haha
Oct 05 14:58:33 <mcatanzaro>	clopez: It was funny? :D
Oct 05 14:59:56 <clopez>	RMS i mean
Oct 05 15:00:06 <clopez>	yes ;)
Oct 05 15:07:05 <blino>	mcatanzaro: ah, then we can just use an OpenSSL backend for WPE
Oct 05 15:07:13 <blino>	mcatanzaro: so, should we close the bug?
Oct 05 15:08:11 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Maybe, but TBH it seems useful to switch to libgcrypt anyway, to get the less-restrictive license. Especially if you have ported HMAC as well.
Oct 05 15:10:31 <blino>	we should also check with the EFL port, I think they use the GnuTLS backends as well
Oct 05 15:58:11 <mcatanzaro>	blino: gyuyoung will be online in a couple of hours. I suspect that whatever we do will be fine for EFL.

Oct 06 14:01:49 <blino>	zdobersek: so, as expected, it's quite hard to build latest WPE with gcc 4.8, mostly because of Variant.h
Oct 06 15:29:26 <zdobersek>	blino: sorry, but I don't see a simple solution here
Oct 06 15:30:28 <annulen>	there are a lot of places where generic lambdas are used, gcc 4.8 cannot handle them
Oct 06 16:25:22 <blino>	annulen: yep, we have a WPE branch where we reverted that...
Oct 06 17:18:30 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Is this MIPS hardware where GCC 4.9 and clang are both unavailable? Maybe it's time to finally address that problem....
Oct 06 17:19:46 <blino>	mcatanzaro: no, it's ARM, same as your main STB customer I guess
Oct 06 17:21:01 <mcatanzaro>	How can GCC 4.9 be unavailable on ARM? No way?
Oct 06 17:21:05 <blino>	mcatanzaro: we are adressing this internally, but it takes quite some time, and usually the toolchain needs to be provided and "supported" by the chipet vendor
Oct 06 17:21:24 <blino>	we may end up using two toolchains in parallel for our target
Oct 06 17:22:00 *	mcatanzaro loves being able to say what he thinks on IRC: perhaps people shouldn't buy crap chipsets from crap vendors
Oct 06 17:22:54 <blino>	well, there is not much competition with Broadcom anymore unfortunately
Oct 06 17:23:39 <mcatanzaro>	Really? All Linux devs know to avoid any laptops with crap Broadcom wireless, they make other crap too?
Oct 06 17:24:03 <mcatanzaro>	Never ceases to amaze me how bad embedded hardware is....
Oct 06 17:24:32 <blino>	most ISPs provide gateway and STB based on Broadcom chipsets, to my knowledge
Oct 06 17:25:20 <mcatanzaro>	blino: And you managed to downstream-patch WPE to make it build with GCC 4.8 all this time, until now?
Oct 06 17:27:35 <blino>	mcatanzaro: it's only since may 2016 that we have the issue IIRC, I started from a patch probably made by a RDK contributor for the 2016-06 WPE version, but it was not complete, I packed more "reverts" on top of it to finish the work, and just did it again today for the 2016-09 version
Oct 06 17:27:42 <blino>	but I would not trust this in production...
Oct 07 03:51:43 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos! I have some problems reworking that IM patch to use the GUniquePtr.. It looks like you can't move the GUniquePtr instances.. The build fails with: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/445407/26292147/ after reading http://stackoverflow.com/a/15032693 I went ahead and tried to wrote an explicit move constructor.. But the thing is that the GUniquePtr class is Noncopyable (WTF_MAKE_NONCOPYABLE) so the build fails as well with
Oct 07 03:51:43 <tpopela>	https://paste.fedoraproject.org/445408/58266581/ .. :/
Oct 07 03:52:23 <KaL>	GUniquePtr is just an alias of std::unique_ptr
Oct 07 03:52:48 <KaL>	that's why we use move, because it's non copyable
Oct 07 04:00:39 <KaL>	tpopela: I don't understand why that happens, it's using the unique_ptr as a reference instead of as &&
Oct 07 04:01:54 <tpopela>	KaL, I don't know as well :/
Oct 07 04:02:03 <KaL>	zdobersek: ^
Oct 07 04:02:42 <KaL>	only zdobersek and chuck norris understand C++
Oct 07 04:05:31 <KaL>	wait, I know what happens
Oct 07 04:05:43 <KaL>	std::function is copyable
Oct 07 04:05:55 <KaL>	so its captured memebers shuld be copyable
Oct 07 04:06:35 <KaL>	tpopela: change FilterKeyEventCompletionHandler in InputMethodFilter.h to be a Function instead of a std::function
Oct 07 04:06:54 <KaL>	tpopela: Function is a non copyable version of std::function from WTF
Oct 07 04:07:29 <tpopela>	KaL, ok I will try it.. But I touched the WTF code, so I need to recompile a lot of stuff (and I'm not in the office :/)..
Oct 07 04:07:38 <tpopela>	KaL, nice catch!
Oct 07 04:18:37 <zdobersek>	IIRC std::function<> stores a std::unique_ptr<> without a problem, as long as the std::function<> object isn't copied
Oct 07 04:19:20 <zdobersek>	not sure if the issue is how the lambda object is created and converted to std::function<>
Oct 07 04:19:30 <zdobersek>	WTF::Function<> is a better option though
Oct 07 04:53:48 <blino>	zdobersek: by the way, I have made the master wpe tree build with gcc 4.8, will push a branch on the Metrological repo
Oct 07 04:54:33 <blino>	zdobersek: also, it seems some Tools fail to build, do you skip them locally? for example some include wpe-mesa/view-backend-exportable.h which has been removed
Oct 07 05:05:42 <zdobersek>	blino: those subdirs are commented out in Tools/CMakeLists.txt
Oct 07 06:09:08 <blino>	zdobersek: not WebKitTestRunner and TestWebKitAPI, maybe specific to developer mode
Oct 07 06:16:33 <zdobersek>	yes, those two are enabled via DEVELOPER_MODE
Oct 07 06:45:46 <tpopela>	KaL, So changing it to Function fixed it.. Thanks!
Oct 07 10:49:27 <kov>	tpopela, looks like the fix to not crash on jp IM made a bunch of tests crash
Oct 07 11:41:35 <KaL>	kov, tpopela: I reviewed it to fast, problem is that event is used after moved
Oct 07 11:41:39 <KaL>	tpopela: &event->key, [priv, event = WTFMove(event)
Oct 07 11:41:50 <KaL>	tpopela: you should use keyEvent in the first case
Oct 07 11:41:54 <KaL>	instead of event
Oct 07 13:59:38 <blino>	annulen: thanks for the quick review
Oct 07 14:00:47 <annulen>	blino: np

Oct 11 16:37:02 <lufimtse>	Question: Does webkit2gtk+ use JavaScriptCore?
Oct 11 16:37:17 <mcatanzaro>	lufimtse: yes
Oct 11 16:38:05 <lufimtse>	So things that worked in webkit1 (ex "WebKitGTK.JSEvaluateScript(...)") should also work in webkit2? (webkit2 gtk)
Oct 11 16:38:18 <lufimtse>	?
Oct 11 16:38:55 <mcatanzaro>	lufimtse: Kinda... remember that JS is actually executed in the web process now, not the UI process

Oct 13 13:52:51 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: Naive idea: add CODE_GENERATOR_PREPROCESSOR_ARGUMENTS defined right above CODE_GENERATOR_PREPROCESSOR that is just the "-E -P -x c++" portion, use it to define CODE_GENERATOR_PREPROCESSOR, then use ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} directly plus ${CODE_GENERATOR_PREPROCESSOR_ARGUMENTS} in your add_custom_command
Oct 13 13:52:56 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: the only existing use of CODE_GENERATOR_PREPROCESSOR passes the invocation string to a perl script, so..

Oct 13 14:04:18 <brrian>	annulen: if CODE_GENERATOR_PREPROCESSOR is a list, then "${CODE_GENERATOR_PREPROCESSOR}" will use semicolons to delimit it

Oct 13 14:05:34 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: Problem is CMake already exists and has to be backwards-compatible... no doubt it would be different if started from scratch
Oct 13 14:05:39 <brrian>	so \"${CODE_GENERATOR_PREPROCESSOR}\"  ?
Oct 13 14:06:10 <annulen>	I can fix script so it takes array of args for --preprocessor
Oct 13 14:06:16 <annulen>	but that's a crude hack :)
Oct 13 14:06:33 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: all I'm suggesting in they add utility functions which do one-way conversions from lists to properly escaped space delimited arg strings :P
Oct 13 14:06:54 <brrian>	annulen: nah
Oct 13 14:07:27 <clopez>	maybe you need to call this https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/separate_arguments.html
Oct 13 14:13:08 <annulen>	brrian: actually if something can be solved on perl side, IMO it's better to do it there than inflate cmake hackery, and --preprocessor  /usr/bin/c++ -E -P -x c++ as alternative to  --preprocessor  "/usr/bin/c++ -E -P -x c++" doesn't seem too evil
Oct 13 14:13:58 <brrian>	annulen: that seems strictly worse than CMake hackery
Oct 13 14:14:12 <annulen>	ok
Oct 13 14:14:14 <brrian>	what if we need a long option?
Oct 13 14:14:38 <brrian>	btw, using as a list from the various callsites won't work
Oct 13 14:14:45 <brrian>	because most of them are VERBATIM
Oct 13 14:15:04 <brrian>	so \"${CODE_GENERATOR_PREPROCESSOR}\" will pass along escaped "
Oct 13 14:15:16 <brrian>	and without it, it stringifies the list with
Oct 13 14:15:16 <brrian>	;
Oct 13 14:15:34 <brrian>	back to the original idea, separate arguments variable
Oct 13 14:59:13 <brrian>	i think i have something that works. will verify with my patch then split out the Cmake fidgeting
Oct 13 16:20:59 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: care to review? https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163401
Oct 13 16:23:25 *	mcatanzaro looks
Oct 13 16:23:49 <mcatanzaro>	Is the mac-debug EWS having problems, or is it your patch? :)
Oct 13 16:24:01 <mcatanzaro>	Ah it touches only CMake, not your patch then
Oct 13 16:24:25 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: I pinged the appropriate people to take a look
Oct 13 16:24:34 <brrian>	git can't take a lock or something dumb
Oct 13 16:25:30 <mcatanzaro>	OK looks sane to me, I'll save cq+ for annulen in case he wants to take a look
Oct 13 16:25:59 <brrian>	k. I'll wait for Windows EWS too
Oct 14 06:54:59 <annulen>	brrian: sorry I've missed mcatanzaro's ping, but I like that patch
Oct 14 07:39:32 <ManDay>	Is there any browser at all besides Epiphany which compiles with webkit 2.13 ?
Oct 14 07:40:44 <ManDay>	>webkit 2.13, that is
Oct 14 07:42:18 <annulen>	2.14?
Oct 14 07:45:19 <ManDay>	for example
Oct 14 09:31:39 <tevaum>	ManDay: did u check midori?
Oct 14 10:15:50 <ManDay>	afaik it doesn't support current webkit
Oct 14 10:36:28 <MonkeyofDoom>	the WebKit2Only branch does; trunk doesn't
Oct 14 10:36:49 <MonkeyofDoom>	the wk2 branch is what future development/releases will be based on (it'll merge to trunk at some point)
Oct 14 10:37:06 <MonkeyofDoom>	sadly there's just not much movement rn, I think all the developers are pretty low on time to work on it :x
Oct 14 12:12:47 <ManDay>	cool, didn't know about the wk2only branch, will try it!
Oct 14 12:13:43 <ManDay>	In the meantime, I tried to make webkit with the usual config options   but I now get an error at 100% while linking saying "PlatformDisplay.cpp: undefined reference to "WebCore::GLContext::createSharingContext(WebCore::PLatformDisplay&)
Oct 14 12:13:50 <ManDay>	can anyone help with that?
Oct 14 12:14:20 <mcatanzaro>	Are you trying to build with -DENABLE_OPENGL=OFF?
Oct 14 12:14:35 <mcatanzaro>	What are your "usual config options"? Are you doing anything more than -DPORT=GTK?
Oct 14 12:14:40 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: ^
Oct 14 12:20:06 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: oh yeah, sorry, hold on
Oct 14 12:20:16 <ManDay>	building a pure wayland/egl build, here are my options:
Oct 14 12:21:13 <ManDay>	https://paste.pound-python.org/show/kMPwAoJkjkXz4K8XWhm0
Oct 14 12:21:39 <annulen>	ENABLE_OPENGL=OFF
Oct 14 12:22:39 <ManDay>	annulen: yes, that I always had in there, because I only have EGL
Oct 14 12:22:44 <ManDay>	(due to wayland without X)
Oct 14 12:24:44 <annulen>	use X or suffer :D
Oct 14 12:25:05 <KaL>	but that ENABLE_OPENGL is generic option for gl
Oct 14 12:25:21 <ManDay>	KaL: No, it isn't, actually.
Oct 14 12:25:29 <ManDay>	At least it wasn't for 2.13
Oct 14 12:25:40 <KaL>	if you build without x it should not build glx
Oct 14 12:25:47 <ManDay>	indeed
Oct 14 12:25:56 <KaL>	if you want gles2
Oct 14 12:26:01 <KaL>	you should enable it
Oct 14 12:26:06 <KaL>	and then it disabled the opengl api
Oct 14 12:26:20 <KaL>	I know it's confusing
Oct 14 12:26:32 <ManDay>	well as I said those options have worked for 2.13
Oct 14 12:27:24 <KaL>	in 2.13 we didn't support EGL + wayland
Oct 14 12:27:25 <ManDay>	you see, i have GLES2 ON and OPENGL OFF
Oct 14 12:27:31 <KaL>	so you had gl disabled in general
Oct 14 12:27:32 <ManDay>	KaL: Hah, funny
Oct 14 12:27:50 <ManDay>	So sorry, say again, it should be GLES2 ON and OPENGL OFF? Because that's what I have
Oct 14 12:28:34 <ManDay>	maybe i should mention kind of an oddity, that is, when configuring, it summarizes "ENABLE_WAYLAND_TARGET    OFF"   but when I check with CCMAKE, it says  ENABLE_WAYLAND_TARGET ON
Oct 14 12:28:39 <ManDay>	(possibly/likely unrelated)
Oct 14 12:28:41 <KaL>	ENABLE_GLES2 is ignored if ENABLE_OPENGL is off
Oct 14 12:28:59 <ManDay>	KaL: I couldn't parse your sentence there:
Oct 14 12:29:12 <ManDay>	ah, okay, nvm, I think I get it now
Oct 14 12:29:25 <ManDay>	Should have ENABLE_OPENGL ON and ENABLE_GLES2 on and it will build without Opengl
Oct 14 12:29:28 <ManDay>	(but gles2 only)
Oct 14 12:29:44 <ManDay>	meh, bloody 3 hours of compile time wasted
Oct 14 12:29:53 <KaL>	yes
Oct 14 12:30:10 <KaL>	what is mutually excusive is USE_OPENGL and ENABLE_GLES2
Oct 14 12:30:26 <KaL>	but ENABLE_OPENGL is for disabling all gl
Oct 14 12:30:59 <KaL>	I think we should fail the configure if ENABLE_OPENGL=OFF and ENABLE_GLES2=ON, feel free to file a bug report
Oct 14 12:31:15 <ManDay>	ok
Oct 14 12:31:25 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: Wait, that's not right
Oct 14 12:31:58 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: elaborate
Oct 14 12:32:11 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: We already have code for that
Oct 14 12:32:16 <mcatanzaro>	WEBKIT_OPTION_DEPEND(ENABLE_GLES2 ENABLE_OPENGL)
Oct 14 12:32:25 <mcatanzaro>	Is our dependency tracking code broken?
Oct 14 12:32:31 <KaL>	no idea
Oct 14 12:32:48 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Please post the full output from CMake
Oct 14 12:33:11 <mcatanzaro>	ENABLE_GLES2 should have been either turned off automatically by ENABLE_OPENGL, or you should have gotten an error message from CMake
Oct 14 12:33:13 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: which one? the one with -DENABLE_OPENGL=ON -DENABLE_GLES2=ON  or the one with -DENABLE_OPENGL=OFF ?
Oct 14 12:33:31 <ManDay>	I just deleted my ./build, so please don't tell me that wasn't the problem
Oct 14 12:33:33 <ManDay>	:=
Oct 14 12:33:35 <ManDay>	=)
Oct 14 12:35:03 <KaL>	ManDay: you don't really need  -DENABLE_OPENGL=ON because it's the defaul, simply use -DENABLE_GLES2=ON
Oct 14 12:36:28 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Did you attempt a build with -DENABLE_OPENGL=ON -DENABLE_GLES2=OFF? I thought that was what we were talking about.
Oct 14 12:36:34 <mcatanzaro>	Sorry, vice-versa
Oct 14 12:36:46 <mcatanzaro>	Did you attempt a build with -DENABLE_OPENGL=OFF -DENABLE_GLES2=ON?
Oct 14 12:36:51 <mcatanzaro>	That one
Oct 14 12:37:24 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: It's too confusing, we should get rid of ENABLE_OPENGL, ENABLE_GLES2 and just use #if USE(OPENGL) || USE(OPENGLES2) everywhere
Oct 14 12:37:29 <mcatanzaro>	OpenGLES2 is not OpenGL
Oct 14 12:38:12 <KaL>	not really
Oct 14 12:38:25 <KaL>	according to the command pasted before
Oct 14 12:38:36 <KaL>	-DENABLE_OPENGL=OFF
Oct 14 12:38:45 <KaL>	but nothing about GLES2
Oct 14 12:38:57 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: yes, gl=off, gles=on is what I did
Oct 14 12:39:04 <KaL>	so ENABLE_OPENGL=OFF build is broken we should fix that in any case
Oct 14 12:39:05 <ManDay>	(and what I did with <2.13)
Oct 14 12:39:20 <KaL>	ManDay: before 2.13 we didn't have gl support at all inj wayland
Oct 14 12:39:49 <KaL>	so, with 2.14 you are building without gl suport as before, and that build is broken, we should fix that
Oct 14 12:39:58 <ManDay>	yeah, its funny, given that I spend ours with <2.13 to figure out which combination of options would give me webgl :-D
Oct 14 12:40:21 <KaL>	in wayland, none of them < 2.14
Oct 14 12:40:52 <ManDay>	s/ours/hours
Oct 14 12:41:30 <KaL>	you thought you were building with gles, but you were not
Oct 14 12:42:09 <ManDay>	yeah, i was living the illusion. no wonder all the webgl tests didn't work
Oct 14 12:43:21 <ManDay>	should I file this under "WebKit GTK"?
Oct 14 12:43:31 <KaL>	yes
Oct 14 12:44:23 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: I still want to see the CMake output, did it really print that GLES2 would be enabled in the feature list?
Oct 14 12:44:24 <KaL>	ManDay: now, with 2.14 simply use  -DENABLE_GLES2=ON if that's what you want, and it should work
Oct 14 12:44:47 <KaL>	or don't say anything and it will use gl
Oct 14 12:44:53 <mcatanzaro>	OK nevermind, I read KaL and see you didn't set ENABLE_GLES2 at all
Oct 14 12:44:56 <KaL>	but EGL in both cases, no glx
Oct 14 12:45:24 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: <ManDay> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/kMPwAoJkjkXz4K8XWhm0
Oct 14 12:45:50 <ManDay>	bug 163449
Oct 14 12:46:08 <mcatanzaro>	btw ManDay half the options you use are unsupported, I'm surprised it builds :)
Oct 14 12:46:18 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: heh
Oct 14 12:46:29 <mcatanzaro>	Many of these I'd never heard of. What's -DENABLE_FTPDIR=ON?
Oct 14 12:46:42 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: I just picked them up in ccmake
Oct 14 12:47:10 <mcatanzaro>	-DENABLE_CSS3_TEXT=ON? -DENABLE_WEB_REPLAY=ON? -DENABLE_WEB_ANIMATIONS=ON? -DENABLE_CHANNEL_MESSAGING=OFF?
Oct 14 12:47:41 <ManDay>	yes, why not?
Oct 14 12:47:43 <mcatanzaro>	I just wonder if you should be changing settings if neither you nor we understand what they do :-)
Oct 14 12:48:12 <ManDay>	ah, you said it yourself: it builds - what more do I care :-P
Oct 14 12:48:47 <ManDay>	I just thought I want CSS3 text (I actually know what that is) and the web_replay and web_animations stuff sounded like vaguely video-related, which I also want
Oct 14 12:48:52 <ManDay>	so I thought, hell, why not
Oct 14 12:48:54 <mcatanzaro>	Well you're building something using hidden options that nobody else is using, so you're going to have your own custom set bugs... whatever floats your boat
Oct 14 12:49:09 <ManDay>	hidden options?
Oct 14 12:49:20 <ManDay>	they are not hidden. they are offered by cmake as non-advanced options
Oct 14 12:49:34 <mcatanzaro>	Hm, maybe we should fix that :)
Oct 14 12:50:42 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: So what is CSS3 text? Do you know why it is OFF currently? It's a private option (I guess we need to mark our private options as advanced), if it works then is it something that should be turned ON instead of OFF?
Oct 14 12:53:38 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163451
Oct 14 12:54:32 <mcatanzaro>	Er wait, we already have code to do that....
Oct 14 12:54:52 <annulen>	I've found bug
Oct 14 12:55:13 <annulen>	set(_WEBKIT_AVAILABLE_OPTIONS_IS_PUBLIC_${_name} ${_public})
Oct 14 12:55:20 <annulen>	in WEBKIT_OPTION_DEFAULT_PORT_VALUE
Oct 14 12:55:35 <annulen>	it sets PRIVATE to _WEBKIT_AVAILABLE_OPTIONS_IS_PUBLIC_${_name}, which is true
Oct 14 12:55:41 <lufimtse>	With webkitGtk2, is there a way for javascript to trigger a callback back into C? Ex I would have a button in Html, when user clicks on that, I would like it to call a GtkCallback. I know that I can execute Javascript with a result via: webkit_web_view_run_javascript(..), but I can't think of a way to tirgger a callback with that?
Oct 14 12:56:01 <lufimtse>	not specifically mouse down, but call a custom C function, 
Oct 14 12:56:42 <mcatanzaro>	lufimtse: You probably want to use https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/unstable/WebKitUserContentManager.html#webkit-user-content-manager-register-script-message-handler
Oct 14 12:57:02 <mcatanzaro>	That gets you a C callback in the UI process
Oct 14 12:57:34 <mcatanzaro>	If you want to run C code in the web process then you'll need to write your own web extension https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/unstable/WebKitWebExtension.html
Oct 14 12:58:23 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Here's a question then: why does the option list print correctly?
Oct 14 12:58:32 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: what is "private"? How am I supposed to know? I see those options all in the same list - nothing tells me I shouldn't touch some of them
Oct 14 12:58:35 <mcatanzaro>	I can see that the variables are not actually being marked as advanced, they show up with 'cmake -L'
Oct 14 12:58:42 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: It's a bug :-)
Oct 14 12:58:46 <ManDay>	usually the rule is you put those which are not to be tampered with in advanced
Oct 14 12:58:48 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: ah ok
Oct 14 12:59:00 <ManDay>	as for text, css3 text is a module spec from w3c
Oct 14 12:59:06 <ManDay>	one which I appreciate very much
Oct 14 12:59:28 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: We check if (${_WEBKIT_AVAILABLE_OPTIONS_IS_PUBLIC_${_name}}) to decide whether to print the option in the option list
Oct 14 12:59:41 <mcatanzaro>	Does that check really pass if it's defined to FALSE?
Oct 14 12:59:44 <mcatanzaro>	Because that check is working
Oct 14 13:00:02 <mcatanzaro>	But to decide whether to mark as advanced, we use if (NOT _WEBKIT_AVAILABLE_OPTIONS_IS_PUBLIC_${_name})
Oct 14 13:00:05 <mcatanzaro>	And that is broken
Oct 14 13:00:24 <lufimtse>	mcatanzaro, thank you, that really helps.
Oct 14 13:00:35 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: I think I wrote most of this, but I guess I never learned how to use CMake conditionals. :D
Oct 14 13:04:16 *	annulen debugs
Oct 14 13:04:32 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Either it's experimental and not yet ready, or it's a bug that the option is OFF; that option is supposed to be marked as advanced for developers only. If you think it's working well you might choose to mail webkit-dev@lists.webkit.org to ask about it being turned on
Oct 14 13:13:46 <annulen>	mcatanzaro:
Oct 14 13:13:47 <annulen>	set(PUBLIC YES)
Oct 14 13:13:49 <annulen>	set(PRIVATE NO)
Oct 14 13:14:15 <annulen>	...
Oct 14 13:14:37 <mcatanzaro>	Hmmm, is that not right? That explains why PRIVATE is not TRUE, right?
Oct 14 13:14:54 <annulen>	they print as "PRIVATE" in messages
Oct 14 13:15:42 <annulen>	I think cmake fanboys would hang you for that, it's like #define private public :)
Oct 14 13:16:02 <mcatanzaro>	Oh well, I couldn't find another way to make it work nicely :-)
Oct 14 13:17:03 <mcatanzaro>	Wait, surely I did not define YES to PUBLIC and NO to PRIVATE? That defines PUBLIC to YES and PRIVATE to NO. There should be no problem..>?
Oct 14 13:17:20 <ManDay>	erm https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/mark_as_advanced.html ?
Oct 14 13:17:41 <ManDay>	i have no clue what you mean by "private"
Oct 14 13:17:42 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: We already call that, our code is broken
Oct 14 13:17:56 <mcatanzaro>	We are playing "spot the bug"
Oct 14 13:18:14 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: right, nothing criminal actually, my bad
Oct 14 13:18:14 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/cmake/WebKitFeatures.cmake
Oct 14 13:18:31 <annulen>	still don't get why does it work like it does
Oct 14 13:19:23 <mcatanzaro>	I guess the bug is if (NOT _WEBKIT_AVAILABLE_OPTIONS_IS_PUBLIC_${_name})
Oct 14 13:19:32 <mcatanzaro>	I think it's checking if the setting is defined, not what it's set to
Oct 14 13:19:46 <mcatanzaro>	And it's always set to either PUBLIC (ON) or PRIVATE (OFF(
Oct 14 13:19:49 <ManDay>	puh, you have one convoluted cmake file there
Oct 14 13:20:19 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Ask me why we don't use CMake's own option dependency tracking (and I won't be able to give you an answer, because I don't know, even though I rewrote most of this myself :)
Oct 14 13:21:34 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: actually, there is feature_summary
Oct 14 13:21:59 <annulen>	I started using it for Qt to show find_package results, as it was requested by user
Oct 14 13:22:05 <annulen>	but it can also show options
Oct 14 13:22:30 <annulen>	I wasn't aware of that macro before as I'm not cmake fan actually
Oct 14 13:23:07 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: It's a CMake built-in?
Oct 14 13:23:14 <annulen>	yep
Oct 14 13:23:18 <annulen>	btw, fixed bug
Oct 14 13:23:32 <mcatanzaro>	Yeah, I was right, I just needed to add ${} around it
Oct 14 13:23:46 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: out of curiousity: which "cmake's own option dependency tracking" are you talking about?
Oct 14 13:24:07 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: : I did it in WEBKIT_OPTION_DEFINE and WEBKIT_OPTION_DEFAULT_PORT_VALUE
Oct 14 13:24:38 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Hm, let's take my patch first then since the existing check is wrong, then consider yours if you cleaned up the code to be nicer, OK?
Oct 14 13:24:49 <annulen>	in some contexts cmake can treat variable name with implied ${}
Oct 14 13:24:59 <annulen>	so it can work in one place and fail in other
Oct 14 13:26:52 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: you mean replace all feature tracking with feature_summary? that would be a big change :)
Oct 14 13:27:02 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=291645&action=review
Oct 14 13:27:25 <annulen>	I think my version is better
Oct 14 13:27:35 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Let's see yours!
Oct 14 13:27:59 <mcatanzaro>	Probably we should land mine (it really is just that line that's wrong), then yours if yours cleans this up to be better.
Oct 14 13:29:42 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: http://pastebin.com/0NCVcith
Oct 14 13:30:02 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: ah cool.
Oct 14 13:30:22 <annulen>	I think one patch would be fine, either of
Oct 14 13:31:00 <annulen>	I think mine is cleaner because variable becomes bool as it is used everywhere
Oct 14 13:31:20 <annulen>	but I don't pretend
Oct 14 13:31:48 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: I dunno, don't we already have to dereference all the other variables to use them? (_WEBKIT_AVAILABLE_OPTIONS_INITIAL_VALUE_${_name} etc.? Yours kinda breaks the parallelism, right?
Oct 14 13:33:28 <annulen>	in your patch ${_WEBKIT_AVAILABLE_OPTIONS_IS_PUBLIC_${_name}} is dereferenced as "PRIVATE"
Oct 14 13:33:41 <annulen>	and then implicitly derefenced again
Oct 14 13:35:05 <annulen>	right, yours is more parallel
Oct 14 13:59:15 <ManDay>	hm I forgot how I fixed this last time: ThirdParty/ANGLE/include/EGL/eglplatform.h:111: fatal error: X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directoy
Oct 14 14:00:24 <ManDay>	ah i guess replace by wl_diplsay like in /usr/include/EGL/eglplatform.h
Oct 14 14:00:55 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Looks like a bug....
Oct 14 14:02:00 <ManDay>	well there is that bug in the khronos headers anyway
Oct 14 14:02:29 <ManDay>	where they require X11 stuff. only mesa has an #ifdef NO_X11 thingy around it
Oct 14 14:02:45 <ManDay>	i copied over my /usr/include/EGL/eglplatform.h ... waiting out how this works
Oct 14 14:51:50 <tevaum>	lufimtse: did you get your use case with JavaScript and C working?
Oct 14 14:57:43 <lufimtse>	tevaum, lonng process. I'm working on SWT, which is a Java library build on top of Gtk. (What Eclipse uses for rendering). We have an embeded browser that currently uses webkit1, I'm in the process of porting to webkit2.
Oct 14 14:57:51 <lufimtse>	thank you for followup
Oct 14 14:58:43 <annulen>	lufimtse: there was some native port of WebKit for Java, is it tied to JavaFX?
Oct 14 15:00:39 <tevaum>	lufimtse: got it. I've already proposed building an api for javascriptcore that's more gobject-like... Waiting for reply to actually begin working on that.
Oct 14 15:01:15 <lufimtse>	Interesting
Oct 14 15:01:23 <lufimtse>	tevaum, do you have any links to proposal?
Oct 14 15:03:41 <tevaum>	lufimtse: it's just a proof of concept actually... As I told you, I'm waiting for reply from KaL to really start working on it...
Oct 14 15:04:12 <tevaum>	You can check it for examples of JSC usage, though
Oct 14 15:04:13 <tevaum>	https://github.com/tevaum/jsc-bindings
Oct 14 15:08:15 <tevaum>	And it's what mcatanzaro already told you. In webkit2, JSC runs on the WebProcess. If you want to extend the Javascript available to your webpage only on the WebProcess, all you need is an Webextension.
Oct 14 15:09:16 <tevaum>	And if you need the WebExtension to talk to the UIProcess, use WebKitContentManager
Oct 14 15:12:56 <lufimtse>	tevaum, hmm, interesting.
Oct 14 15:13:16 <lufimtse>	With SWT, things are a bit complex as I essentially need to make all calls dynamic.
Oct 14 15:13:29 <lufimtse>	I can't use any "#include ... "
Oct 14 15:13:51 <lufimtse>	because we have to support webkit1/webkit2, depending on underlying platform support. 
Oct 14 15:25:56 <annulen>	lufimtse: I'm afraid you have to use separate code paths for wk1 and wk2

Oct 17 12:37:51 <mcatanzaro>	So for F26 we discussed that we should add a webkit2gtk3 package that's the same as the webkitgtk4 package, then retire webkitgtk4, so as to avoid confusion by having webkitgtk4 (WebKit2 for GTK+ 3) and webkit2gtk4 (WebKit2 for GTK+ 4) packages
Oct 17 12:38:03 <mcatanzaro>	Who wants to create the new package. :P

Oct 17 13:20:26 <aperezdc>	mcatanzaro: JFTR, in Arch Linux the package is plainly called webkit2gtk
Oct 17 13:21:43 <MonkeyofDoom>	this is going to be really fun when GTK4 comes out
Oct 17 13:21:52 <MonkeyofDoom>	oh nvm that's what you said
Oct 17 13:21:59 <mcatanzaro>	Yes ;)
Oct 17 13:22:12 <MonkeyofDoom>	sounds sane :P
Oct 18 05:15:14 <ManDay>	Compiled GTK+ with debug symbols now to find this problem
Oct 18 08:41:51 <ManDay>	gustavoz: sorry for my bad habit about loosing the scrollback, but could you give me the link to your epoxy patches again (i save it this time, promise)
Oct 18 08:50:30 <ManDay>	I finally filed a bug, I think this IS actually a webkit fault https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163595
Oct 18 09:08:56 <kov>	ManDay, that looks like gtk is failing to use gles2, not WebKit
Oct 18 09:09:41 <kov>	ManDay, your breakpoint is hit when WebKit asks GTK 'can you actually use GL?'
Oct 18 09:11:17 <ManDay>	yeah - i've broken on gdk_wayland_gl_context_realize
Oct 18 09:11:22 <ManDay>	and there it decides to not use es
Oct 18 09:11:31 <ManDay>	i ask ebassi maybe he knows
Oct 18 09:15:54 <ManDay>	i don't know where _gdk_gl_flags is set, but I think it's wrong
Oct 18 09:18:41 <kov>	ManDay, it's set in gdk/gdk.c, it parses the GDK_GL env variable
Oct 18 09:19:03 <ManDay>	oh jeez ... are you telling me I need to set an env variable so that GDK uses GLES
Oct 18 09:19:28 <kov>	it may be the case that WebKit could explicitly request ES from GTK+, but it should detect automatically in this case, it seems
Oct 18 09:20:21 <ManDay>	are you suggesting the gdk.c is not detecting it correctly?
Oct 18 09:21:08 <kov>	ManDay, I am not suggesting anything specific, just that gdk should probably detect it should use gles automatically, when gl is unavailable
Oct 18 09:23:29 <ManDay>	hm yeah.. judging from gdk.c it just parses the env var
Oct 18 09:23:33 <ManDay>	at least if that's all the magic
Oct 18 09:24:33 <ManDay>	well at least I got it to use_es=1 now
Oct 18 09:25:56 <ManDay>	but the context that is passed into gl_context_realize is still with use_es=false
Oct 18 09:26:53 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, Hi Michael! Are you on F25?
Oct 18 09:27:31 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: I have a F25 laptop I can boot up if need be, but it's inconvenient to connect to the Internet since I have to move the Ethernet cord from my F24 desktop to my laptop. :P
Oct 18 09:29:12 <ManDay>	kov: According to the break points, gdk_gl_context_realize is called *before* gdk_gl_context_set_use_es
Oct 18 09:29:15 <ManDay>	is that the bug in webkit?
Oct 18 09:31:54 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, I'm just curious if WebKit compiles there for you with ninja.. For me it does not :/.. The thing is that I'm getting a lot of failures about relocations - it's suggesting me to compile with -fPIC, but that we already do (I checked the build.ninja file and it is there for the files that are failing).. But when I check the output object file with "readelf --relocs foo.o | egrep '(GOT|PLT|JU?MP_SLOT)'" - the file was not
Oct 18 09:31:54 <tpopela>	compiled with -fPIC..
Oct 18 09:33:21 <annulen>	from my experience, using ninja does not alter used build flags anyhow
Oct 18 09:34:12 <annulen>	with the same cmake settings and makefile generator I'd expected you get the same error (or both should work fine)
Oct 18 09:35:57 <tpopela>	annulen, mcatanzaro oh and I should note that passing --no-ninja (so using the unix makefiles) it works..
Oct 18 09:36:25 <mcatanzaro>	Hm
Oct 18 09:36:49 <mcatanzaro>	I dunno, that's a shame :(
Oct 18 09:37:18 <annulen>	tpopela: save CMakeCache.txt from both builds and diff them
Oct 18 09:40:34 <tpopela>	annulen, Ok, will try that.
Oct 18 09:42:21 <tpopela>	annulen, mcatanzaro here are the errors - just in case ;) - https://paste.fedoraproject.org/454979/76798122/
Oct 18 09:42:28 <tpopela>	some of them..
Oct 18 09:43:31 <tpopela>	annulen, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/454981/76798190/
Oct 18 09:46:57 <annulen>	they are indentical
Oct 18 09:47:22 <tpopela>	annulen, yes :/
Oct 18 09:47:43 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Are all of the errors in gtest?
Oct 18 09:48:24 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, nope sometimes in JavaScriptCore..
Oct 18 09:49:23 <mcatanzaro>	Only thing I could find with Google: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1194520
Oct 18 09:49:26 <mcatanzaro>	I don't understand the fix there at all
Oct 18 09:50:09 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, this is part of the build.ninja file for one of the gtest files that are failing..
Oct 18 09:50:09 <tpopela>	https://paste.fedoraproject.org/454989/47679856/
Oct 18 09:50:17 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: I bet fweimer would be able to tell us what to do
Oct 18 09:50:25 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, and -fPIC sits there..
Oct 18 09:50:28 <annulen>	tpopela: compare command line arguments when building one of those file from error messages with ninja and make, to see if compiler flags are same or not
Oct 18 09:51:42 <tpopela>	annulen, I would like to do so, but there is nothing like super verbose ninja flag.. but I remember the I was looking at the ps ax output the -fPIC was not there where compiling with ninja..
Oct 18 09:51:49 <KaL_out>	tpopela: I have the same issue only when using icecc, my solution was to downgrade cmake
Oct 18 09:51:57 <tpopela>	annulen, but I will retry..
Oct 18 09:52:08 <tpopela>	KaL_out, hmmm I'm using icecc..
Oct 18 09:52:30 <KaL_out>	it failds for me with with cmake 3.6.2 works with 3.5.x
Oct 18 09:52:36 <tpopela>	KaL_out, hah.. let me check the cmake version of f24 and f25..
Oct 18 09:52:44 <KaL_out>	gotta go now, bbl
Oct 18 09:52:58 <tpopela>	KaL_out, thank, you saved us as always! :)
Oct 18 09:54:43 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, can you try something for me? open http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=1485 in epiphany hit Ctrl + F and try to find f25, but be sure that the 25 is written on numpad (on external keyboard)..
Oct 18 09:55:13 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Would you believe my external keyboard does not have a numpad
Oct 18 09:55:40 <mcatanzaro>	When I bought it I thought: "I will never be able to debug numpad related bugs, but these only occur once per year so whatever"
Oct 18 09:55:41 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, ok :D
Oct 18 09:56:09 <mcatanzaro>	Now I have +2 inches of desk space! :D
Oct 18 09:56:11 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, so the thing is that when I press the 4, it jumps back in history..
Oct 18 09:56:30 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, and 6 forward :D
Oct 18 09:56:38 <mcatanzaro>	Lovely
Oct 18 09:56:48 <mcatanzaro>	I guess those are the buttons that normally have arrow keys?
Oct 18 09:56:53 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, ok, I will look at it then if you don't have hardware to reproduce it :D
Oct 18 09:56:54 <mcatanzaro>	Still strange
Oct 18 09:57:00 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, yes..
Oct 18 09:57:25 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: https://git.gnome.org/browse/epiphany/tree/src/ephy-window.c#n126
Oct 18 09:57:32 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, and F3 does not jump to next occurance..
Oct 18 09:57:43 <mcatanzaro>	Should we just remove KP_4 and KP_6 there?
Oct 18 09:57:52 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, huh..
Oct 18 09:57:54 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, yes!
Oct 18 09:58:13 <mcatanzaro>	I didn't know about the F3 shortcut, it doesn't work in gedit....
Oct 18 09:58:21 <mcatanzaro>	I'll remove KP_4 and KP_6. That was an easy bug!
Oct 18 09:58:32 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, btw do you have some SRPM package with libhttpseverywhere?
Oct 18 09:58:56 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: No, I guess I'd better make one but the API is still pretty unstable
Oct 18 09:59:19 <mcatanzaro>	Hm, 3.23.1 is one week away, got to do it soon
Oct 18 09:59:36 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, I was trying to compile the epiphany, but I failed on that one..
Oct 18 10:00:02 <mcatanzaro>	You'll have to build it manually for now; it's hooked up nicely in jhbuild
Oct 18 10:00:24 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, that F3 thing is from Chrome and Firefox.. I just used to it.. That's the same with Alt + D shortcut for address bar..
Oct 18 10:00:28 <mcatanzaro>	Actually with git master I've disabled all the libhttpseverywhere code due to API changes, so you can just comment out the dep in configure.ac and it should work (for a day or two, until I reenable it :)
Oct 18 10:00:35 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, I don't use jhbuild ;)
Oct 18 10:00:58 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, ok, will do that :D
Oct 18 10:03:58 <ManDay>	kov: ebassi said that Gdk is not supposed to autodetect the backend and webkit is supposed to specify that it wants to use GLES
Oct 18 10:58:42 <tpopela>	KaL_out, mcatanzaro, annulen ok, downgrading cmake helped.. Thank you Carlos!
Oct 18 10:59:29 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Time to file a CMake bug?
Oct 18 10:59:37 <mcatanzaro>	(yet again...)
Oct 18 11:01:42 <annulen>	I think it would be better to test 3.7.0-rc1 first
Oct 18 11:03:17 <ManDay>	gustavoz: ping?
Oct 18 13:02:31 <kov>	ManDay, fun, so it will simply fail if GL is not available but GLES is?
Oct 18 13:02:45 <ManDay>	yes
Oct 18 13:03:02 <ManDay>	unfortunally my internet is broken atm, otherwise I'd comment on the bug
Oct 18 13:03:16 <ManDay>	does anyone know which annoying program modifies /etc/resolv.conf ... ?
Oct 18 13:04:27 <kov>	ManDay, fun… I'll try to make a patch... as for the last question: NetworkManager, systemd-network, connman, resolvconf, any of those
Oct 18 13:04:47 <ManDay>	i guess resolvconf
Oct 18 13:05:04 <ManDay>	kov: the correct method is simply calling gdk_gl_context_set_use_es( ) before the context is realized
Oct 18 13:05:42 <ManDay>	but even that will not help me right now, because libepoxy is still broken. and even fixing libexpoxy does not help, because gdk is still breaking the EGL context... and so on...

Oct 19 13:33:46 <tevaum>	How can I ask build-webkit to enable an option?
Oct 19 13:36:15 <annulen>	build-webkit --help
Oct 19 13:36:52 <mcrha>	hi mcatanzaro/KaL, I've a semi-interesting issue with WebKitWebExtension-s. We have some unit tests which run one after each other using Glib's test framework. There are two tests where one finishes fine, but the next crashes with an error "Failed to call a DBus Proxy method ...: Message recipient disconnected from message bus without replying". Our web extension uses GDBus. Our unit tests run a separate WebKitWebProcess for each test. After some
Oct 19 13:36:52 <mcrha>	investigation, it turned out that the WebKitWebProcess from the previous test didn't stop yet, thus the D-Bus name had been still active and the new test sent its request to the dying process (thus the error message). It took me some time to figure this out, it's all about "proper" timing.
Oct 19 13:37:13 <mcrha>	the question is: what can I do, to avoid it?
Oct 19 13:38:07 <KaL>	mcrha: you should use unique names
Oct 19 13:38:14 <mcrha>	the WebKitWebPage doesn't seem to have any "I'm dying", or the web process anything like "everything disconnected" from me
Oct 19 13:38:20 <KaL>	mcrha: and pass the dbus name to the extension as user data
Oct 19 13:38:38 <mcrha>	right, that's also an option
Oct 19 13:38:39 <KaL>	mcrha: that's what ephy does
Oct 19 13:39:11 <KaL>	evo should do the same, what happens if you open two evo instances? or is it single instance?
Oct 19 13:39:27 <mcrha>	aha, looks like the easiest thing to do
Oct 19 13:39:37 <KaL>	and safest probably
Oct 19 13:39:46 <mcrha>	evo tries to be smart, thus it have one web process for all the previews and one webprocess for all the editors
Oct 19 13:39:55 <KaL>	ephy creates a private dbus connection
Oct 19 13:40:13 <mcrha>	this is "smart", as for resources
Oct 19 13:40:21 <KaL>	mcrha: why is the editor so slow now? is it wk or evo fault?
Oct 19 13:40:58 <mcrha>	I know that having opened multiple editors, then one crashed will kill all the other, data lost and so on, but having 10 web processes seemed like to oexpensive
Oct 19 13:41:12 <mcrha>	KaL, is it slow? On open, or during editing?
Oct 19 13:41:19 <KaL>	while editing
Oct 19 13:41:33 <mcrha>	hmm, that would be better question for tpopela
Oct 19 13:41:48 <KaL>	well, yes, it's not common to have multiple editors open at the same time anyway
Oct 19 13:42:19 <mcrha>	I know that we try from time to time "refresh spell checking", which used to work in the wk1 times, but since you deal with cursor moved on idle, then it stopped working
Oct 19 13:43:23 <mcrha>	(there was/is a workaround in the code for the missing "refresh spell checking for the document/paragraph" to mimic Ctrl+Right-Arrow presses in the document, to convince webkit to reconsider spell checking
Oct 19 13:43:25 <mcrha>	)
Oct 19 13:44:12 <mcrha>	KaL, it can be that some "magic" feature (magic links, magic smileys) causes the slowness, due to tests "what did you type? Can it be replaced with something nice?"
Oct 19 13:45:01 <KaL>	I'm not sure I use those magic features, I never write html emails, or are those also enabled for plain test emails?
Oct 19 13:45:04 <mcrha>	otherwise no idea at the moment, it can be evo, in can be evo due to the way it is using webkit, it can be webkit. Maybe tpopela knows
Oct 19 13:45:14 <mcrha>	also for plaintext
Oct 19 13:45:29 <KaL>	is evo sending sync dbus messages from the extension to the web process?
Oct 19 13:45:36 <mcrha>	you type "http://webkitgtk.org" and it'll underline it
Oct 19 13:45:43 <KaL>	ah, I see
Oct 19 13:45:59 <mcrha>	sometimes it does, but it doesn't block the UI process, there are workarounds
Oct 19 13:46:25 <mcrha>	for example when we ask for the content, then we usually need it in the synchronous manner
Oct 19 13:46:52 <mcrha>	rewriting the current synchronous code to asynchronous would be a nightmare :(
Oct 19 13:47:41 <mcrha>	okay, different D-Bus names, hmm, feels like deja vu
Oct 19 13:50:13 <mcrha>	KaL, does the WebKitWebView's page-id increases monotonically, or it can repeat after the page (and web view) is closed?
Oct 19 13:51:20 <KaL>	no, it's not reused when a page is closed
Oct 19 13:51:46 <mcrha>	okay, then I'll use it as the addition to the D-Bus name
Oct 19 13:52:02 <mcrha>	unless you've a better option in eph
Oct 19 13:52:43 <KaL>	mcrha: a better approach would be to not use the session bus, but a private connection and then you send the address to the web extension
Oct 19 13:53:34 <KaL>	mcrha: check what ephy does, I think it's not difficult to do the same
Oct 19 13:53:37 <mcrha>	KaL, I will always send the address to the web extension, no? Ah, actually, I see what you mean
Oct 19 13:53:56 <mcrha>	okay, I will do. Thanks KaL :)
Oct 19 13:54:27 <KaL>	mcrha: basically the ui process runs a dbus server and web extensions connect to it
Oct 19 13:54:34 <KaL>	so you send the address to the extensions
Oct 19 13:55:03 <mcrha>	hmm, that sounds complicated
Oct 19 13:55:05 <KaL>	see ephy_embed_shell_setup_web_extensions_server
Oct 19 13:55:07 <KaL>	it's not
Oct 19 13:55:16 <KaL>	gdbus makes it easy
Oct 19 13:55:44 <KaL>	mostly g_dbus_server_new_sync + g_dbus_server_start
Oct 19 13:57:39 <mcrha>	authenticator? eeks

Oct 24 10:08:10 <antoyo>	Hello. It seems there are not methods named  webkit_dom_element_get_bounding_client_rect() in webkitdom to be used by  a web extension. So, I wonder what are the alternatives. I currently use webkit_dom_element_get_offset_{left,top} recursively,  but it does not take CSS3 transformations into account. Is there a way to get the exact position of an element from a web  extension? Thanks for your help.
Oct 24 11:15:53 <KaL>	antoyo: if you need those methods, file a bug report and we can add them
Oct 24 11:25:06 <antoyo>	KaL: Thanks. I've just filed the bug report: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163892

Oct 25 09:51:09 <zdobersek>	quinq: you're building against musl, right? for what architecture?
Oct 25 09:51:25 <quinq>	right, on amd64 (distro void-linux)
Oct 25 09:52:46 <quinq>	I first thought it was a pthread stack size issue because I naively stopped to the first error message jsc gave me, but couldn't find anything wrong there
Oct 25 10:06:28 <quinq>	To be more precise:
Oct 25 10:06:31 <quinq>	Exception: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded.
Oct 25 10:06:41 <quinq>	or simply: “Exception:”
Oct 25 10:14:28 <ManDay>	Can anyone have a look at the crash when bringing up context menus (etc) with GLES2?
Oct 25 12:49:25 <antoyo>	Hello. I have some issues with downloading files with WebKit2gtk. There are some files which does not trigger the download-started event when the download is started from the decide-policy callback which calls policy_decision_download(). For instance, I am unable to download this file: http://www.orimi.com/pdf-test.pdf However, it works fine with this URL when using the webview_download_uri() function. Does anyone have an idea of 
Oct 25 12:52:18 <quinq>	No problem downloading it here
Oct 25 12:52:52 <antoyo>	I mean that I develop my own web browser based on webkit, so I am missing something in my code.
Oct 25 12:53:10 <quinq>	So what's the question?
Oct 25 12:53:24 <antoyo>	Why this specific file does not download while other files download?
Oct 25 12:54:18 <mcatanzaro>	I guess make sure it's not being handled by a PDF plugin
Oct 25 12:55:31 <antoyo>	Thanks for the suggestion. I will check even thought I am able to download another file which is also a PDF.
Oct 25 12:55:50 <mcatanzaro>	hm
Oct 25 12:56:46 <annulen>	they may have different content-type
Oct 25 12:57:20 <quinq>	This one gives application/pdf
Oct 25 12:57:40 <quinq>	Can you provide another url? and/or your code?
Oct 25 12:58:08 <antoyo>	This url works: http://www.buildeazy.com/plans/test.pdf
Oct 25 12:58:25 <antoyo>	            view.connect_decide_policy(move |_, policy_decision, policy_decision_type| {                 println!("{:?}", policy_decision_type);                 if policy_decision_type == Response {                     println!("1");                     let policy_decision = policy_decision.clone();                     if let Ok(policy_decision) = policy_decision.downcast::<ResponsePolicyDecision>() {                         print

Oct 25 13:03:21 <antoyo>	Rust
Oct 25 13:06:25 <quinq>	Can't help you then, sorry ^^
Oct 25 13:21:35 <antoyo>	I found out that clearing the cache allowed me to download the file.
Oct 25 13:22:41 <antoyo>	Is this an expected behaviour?
Oct 25 13:26:46 <antoyo>	Is a download-started event triggered when the file is in cache? What are the situations when this event is not triggered? Thanks.
Oct 25 13:28:18 <mcatanzaro>	I would file a bug, especially if you can reproduce it. Surely download-started should always occur.
Oct 25 13:28:59 <antoyo>	Ok, I'll file a bug if this issue arise once again.
Oct 25 13:29:20 <antoyo>	Thanks everybody for your help.

Oct 26 12:45:22 <ManDay>	I'm trying to get webkitgtk/gstreamer to work with various video sources. i succeeded with youtube but vimeo doesn't work yet. I run minibrowser with GST_DEBUG='*:5' but when I load a page of vimeo, there is no additional output - only the stuff that I get right from the beginning. here is the complete output - is there anything suspicious? https://paste.pound-python.org/show/VoHFUFPeaDH4rK8XPLDo/
Oct 26 12:46:02 <annulen>	ManDay: vimeo requires h264 while on youtube it's not mandatory
Oct 26 12:48:25 <ManDay>	ty! ill check it !
Oct 26 12:49:15 <ManDay>	though: is there any way telling this from the output? I'd have expected something like an error "...looking for plugin to play h264..."
Oct 26 14:09:12 <philn>	ManDay: use GST_DEBUG=webkit*:5
Oct 26 14:10:15 <philn>	vimeo uses HLS, make sure you have the gst hlsdemux element available
Oct 26 14:11:50 <philn>	and a recent version of gstreamer, 1.8.2 at least, hlsdemux/adaptivedemux got many fixes recently
Oct 26 14:11:56 <philn>	gotta go, bye
Oct 26 14:12:44 <ManDay>	thanks all I solved it by installing gst-plugins-libav/ffmpeg
Oct 26 14:12:51 <ManDay>	for mp4 decoding

Oct 27 09:21:37 <tevaum>	Hi, guys... Do I need to fix every error reported by check-webkit-style? I'm using some UIProcess files as reference and they don't pass either... :P
Oct 27 09:22:21 <mcatanzaro>	tevaum: If your code is new and check-webkit-style is not broken, then yes you need to fix it. We do have some existing code (especially around GObject property creation) that doesn't follow the required style, but new code should.
Oct 27 09:22:32 <mcatanzaro>	But if you're just moving code, or if check-webkit-style is just broken, then you can ignore it.
Oct 27 09:22:52 <mcatanzaro>	You're requested to file a bug against check-webkit-style in the later case, though.
Oct 27 09:23:14 <tevaum>	mcatanzaro: it's new code. Glib bindings for JSC...
Oct 27 09:23:44 <annulen>	tevaum: check-webkit-style learns new rules over time, and old code may not follow them for obvious reasons
Oct 27 09:24:05 <mcatanzaro>	tevaum: Then it needs to follow WebKit style. Although there is one exception: any installed header files should follow GNOME style and be added as exceptions to the style-checker, wherever those exceptions are stored (I don't actually know where)
Oct 27 09:24:42 <tevaum>	That will help a lot ;)
Oct 27 09:24:53 <tevaum>	I'll try to figure it out
Oct 27 09:25:53 <tevaum>	It's complaining that I need to include config.h and I don't think it's necessary... Is there any place for me to tell style-checker about this too?
Oct 27 09:26:08 <mcatanzaro>	tevaum: Please include it in every file
Oct 27 09:26:28 <mcatanzaro>	It's too confusing if some files have it missing!
Oct 27 09:26:50 <mcatanzaro>	That's a good rule to follow in every project that uses a config.h
Oct 27 09:27:02 <tevaum>	Ok.
Oct 27 09:27:32 <tevaum>	I thought it was related to WebCore (that's what the description says)
Oct 27 09:27:49 <tevaum>	So I thought it would be unrelated to JSC
Oct 27 09:28:33 <tevaum>	Will use pragma instead of ifndef also...
Oct 27 09:38:35 <tevaum>	What's this "The parameter name 'foo' adds no information, so it should be removed" stuff? Do I have to remove all variable names from header files?
Oct 27 09:43:35 <tevaum>	It seems so...
Oct 27 09:50:11 <tevaum>	http://sprunge.us/EZAZ
Oct 27 09:50:23 <tevaum>	Those are installable headers... ;)
Oct 27 09:50:31 <mcatanzaro>	tevaum: Header files should have variable names only where it helps readability
Oct 27 09:51:05 <tevaum>	What do you mean by that?
Oct 27 09:51:15 <mcatanzaro>	tevaum: There is a whitelist of files for the style-checker to ignore somewhere, I don't know where. You can ignore it in installable headers.
Oct 27 09:51:17 <annulen>	script is clever, it analyses name
Oct 27 09:51:38 <mcatanzaro>	tevaum: E.g. myFunction(const String& string) <-- variable name does not help readability, omit please
Oct 27 09:51:51 <mcatanzaro>	myFunction(const String& launchCode) <-- variable name is good!
Oct 27 09:51:52 <tevaum>	Hummm... Got it
Oct 27 09:52:22 <mcatanzaro>	doSomethingWithURL(const URL& url) <-- again, not needed
Oct 27 09:53:22 <mcatanzaro>	Again, installable headers are an exception, since variable names are required in C
Oct 27 09:53:43 <mcatanzaro>	(Also be sure you use G_BEGIN_DECLS and G_END_DECLS in the installable headers to get C linkage)
Oct 27 09:57:41 <tevaum>	*thumbs up*
Oct 27 10:04:57 <tevaum>	Tools/Scripts/webkitpy/checker.py
Oct 27 10:05:40 <tevaum>	It defines _SKIPPED_FILES_WITH_WARNING
Oct 27 10:06:04 <tevaum>	It's a list of regexps to match ignored files ;)
Oct 27 10:09:11 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, Hi Michael, you have an error in your distribution branding patch - see http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/getfile?taskID=16207112&name=build.log&offset=-40000 and http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/webkitgtk4.git/commit/?id=f5390d3ab623be358dce4ab8b3599e697451730a
Oct 27 10:13:29 <mcatanzaro>	Thanks tpopela: We should just remove the second check, I added it to appease zdobersek and apparently didn't test it :)
Oct 27 10:13:37 <mcatanzaro>	I will update the patch I have on WebKit Bugzilla

Oct 31 13:20:21 <joanie>	So mcatanzaro says that you're the guy to ask about running WPT in minibrowser
Oct 31 13:20:25 <joanie>	is that correct? :)
Oct 31 13:21:17 *	joanie wonders if youenn is busy killing michael now ;)
Oct 31 13:21:24 <youenn>	I am sort of trying to connect WPT and WebKit.
Oct 31 13:21:29 *	youenn is defintily
Oct 31 13:21:54 <youenn>	... importing test regularly and making it possible to use WPT infra in WebKit
Oct 31 13:22:15 <philn>	wasn't there a wiki page explaining how to run it?
Oct 31 13:22:23 <joanie>	ok, so after a test run, when you click the "Download JSON results" button, does it work?
Oct 31 13:22:59 <youenn>	philn: yes, but I need to get back wiki access to update it.
Oct 31 13:23:00 <joanie>	At least in Fedora 25, minibrowser is adding <whatever that bar container is> with widgets including a progress bar
Oct 31 13:23:10 <youenn>	joanie: talking of wptrunner?
Oct 31 13:23:10 <joanie>	philn: I know how to run it
Oct 31 13:23:10 <philn>	hehe
Oct 31 13:23:18 <joanie>	I am running it
Oct 31 13:23:18 <joanie>	I want it to work
Oct 31 13:23:19 <joanie>	;)
Oct 31 13:23:19 <philn>	okdoey
Oct 31 13:23:40 <joanie>	youenn: I'm talking about web-platform-tests
Oct 31 13:23:41 <youenn>	I never tried wptrunner on mini browser. Something broken ?
Oct 31 13:23:44 <joanie>	using that code
Oct 31 13:23:50 <joanie>	youenn: yes
Oct 31 13:23:56 <joanie>	downloading json results is broken
Oct 31 13:24:02 <joanie>	I don't know if it ever worked
Oct 31 13:24:11 <youenn>	have you tried with epiphany?
Oct 31 13:24:35 <joanie>	youenn: I've not. I can try.
Oct 31 13:25:00 <youenn>	maybe there is a restriction in mini-browser concerning the downloads?
Oct 31 13:25:02 <joanie>	Though the reason I'm doing this is to fix an a11y crasher that prevents running a11y tests in wpt in minibrowser
Oct 31 13:25:17 <joanie>	but I could run non-a11y tests after killing a11y processes and see if epiphany has this problem
Oct 31 13:25:58 <youenn>	If a11y are usual tests (not manual), you should be able to run them directly using run-webkit-tests after having imported them.
Oct 31 13:26:17 <joanie>	youenn: this is for ARIA 1.1 CR exit criteria
Oct 31 13:27:45 <youenn>	If you need a dirty hack, you could run wptrunner locally and hack it to display the json so that you can copy/paste it (from html page, or server log for instance).
Oct 31 13:28:07 <joanie>	youenn: ok
Oct 31 13:29:55 <youenn>	If it is just the html that needs to be fixed so that minibrowser can run it, it could also be contributed back to wpt repo.
Oct 31 13:31:31 <joanie>	youenn: sure. I don't think that's it, but i could be wrong.
Oct 31 13:32:53 <joanie>	ok so in epiphany it displays the file (and the button is modified to include the text (right-click and save as to download)
Oct 31 13:33:03 <joanie>	in minibrowser, new widgets appear
Oct 31 13:33:12 <joanie>	i.e. above the toolbar
Oct 31 13:33:26 <joanie>	and it tries to download, but then fails to do so

Nov 02 17:39:27 <antoyo>	Hello. I have an issue with WebKit2 (or possibly gdbus) which also affects Epiphany. When I leave the terminal of my RSS client (newsbeuter), the web browser crashes. I think it happens because gdbus is terminated by the SIGHUP signal (not sure about it thought, it might be WebKit).  The logs show [this GDK error about BadDamage](https://framabin.org/?220ae64305be133e#znWodLhQIl3tJfjNjbqBcAAMp68IVizxYBsqqqptKKU=).
Nov 02 17:39:28 <antoyo>	The debugger shows these: Thread 1 "WebKitWebProces" received signal SIGINT, Interrupt. Thread 4 "gdbus" received signal SIGHUP, Hangup. Couldn't get registers: no such type of processus [Thread 0x7f9ef1b3c700 (LWP 12018) exited] Program terminated with signal SIGHUP, Hangup.  Do you know how to fix this issue? Thanks.
Nov 02 17:50:48 <mcatanzaro>	antoyo: The X window system error is https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164303 but that bug only occurs when the web process is already shutting down. Not sure why your UI process is being killed
Nov 02 17:51:13 <mcatanzaro>	Ah do you have a terminal running INSIDE your RSS client?
Nov 02 17:52:34 <mcatanzaro>	It could well be a bug with the terminal, look at signal(7): "SIGHUP: Hangup detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process"
Nov 02 18:06:35 <antoyo>	The RSS client is a console application.
Nov 02 18:07:09 <quinq>	But how is it related to epiphany?
Nov 02 18:08:35 <antoyo>	I open an URL in Epiphany from the RSS client.
Nov 02 18:20:12 <quinq>	antoyo, what about with other webkit2gtk-based browsers?
Nov 02 18:20:49 <antoyo>	Mine has the same issue but also uses a web extension.
Nov 02 19:04:51 <antoyo>	Even the MiniBrowser has this issue. It does not use gdbus, right?
Nov 02 19:05:48 <antoyo>	mcatanzaro: I don't think it is a bug with the terminal, because other web browsers do not have this issue.
Nov 02 19:06:48 <mcatanzaro>	antoyo: What is sending SIGHUP then? :)
Nov 02 19:07:15 <antoyo>	Well, I believe it is the terminal, but since other web browser are not being killed…
Nov 02 19:07:27 <antoyo>	Only WebKit2 web browsers seem to be affected.
Nov 02 19:09:27 <antoyo>	I tried with a dummy GTK+ application (zathura) and it does not have this issue.
Nov 02 19:10:10 <antoyo>	My web browser is not killed, but the web process is.
Nov 02 19:10:27 <antoyo>	Is there a way to get the reason of a web process being killed?
Nov 02 19:19:52 <antoyo>	Could the crash log help me?
Nov 02 19:21:02 <mcatanzaro>	antoyo: Surely it is being killed by the SIGHUP?
Nov 02 19:22:40 <antoyo>	I think so. It is what this message mean: ""WebKitWebProces" received signal SIGINT, Interrupt. Program terminated with signal SIGHUP, Hangup."?
Nov 02 19:22:59 <mcatanzaro>	Either of those signals would kill the process
Nov 02 19:24:54 <mcatanzaro>	Basically: something on your computer is telling WebKit to die, so it does. I've never heard of this happening before so I'd say it's *probably* the process that's launching WebKit (your RSS reader). Does it work when you launch it from a terminal or from your desktop?
Nov 02 19:26:34 <antoyo>	Oh, it works when I launch it from the terminal.
Nov 02 19:26:49 <antoyo>	from the shell, I mean.
Nov 02 19:28:07 <antoyo>	Both with my browser and Epiphany, it crashes when the RSS reader is launched without the shell, but works fine when launched in the shell.
Nov 02 19:30:09 <antoyo>	What does it mean that it works from the shell, but not without the shell?
Nov 02 19:30:32 <antoyo>	In any case, only WebKit2 based applications are affected by this.
Nov 02 19:31:28 <mcatanzaro>	I don't know, you'd have to dig deep to investigate! Probably the way to start would be to learn about controlling terminals.
Nov 02 19:32:00 <antoyo>	Ok, thanks for your help.
Nov 02 19:32:20 <mcatanzaro>	Wish I knew what was wrong!
Nov 02 19:32:49 <antoyo>	I am still not sure whether it is related to shell vs no shell, because when I run newsbeuter in the shell, but launched by the window manager, it still get the issue.
Nov 02 19:34:05 <antoyo>	Ah, it seems that I only get the issue when using `exec`.
Nov 02 19:35:12 <antoyo>	Hum: "exec process dies when a SIGHUP is received"
Nov 02 19:43:04 <antoyo>	The web-process-crashed event is emitted when the RSS client is closed.
Nov 02 20:21:46 <antoyo>	It is possible that "webkit_uri_request_get_uri ()" sometimes returns an empty string when it should return a URI?

Nov 03 05:31:53 <youenn>	hi
Nov 03 06:56:39 <tevaum>	KaL: Hi. I'm doing some lifecycle tests and already found some bugs. Trying to learn about WTF types and RefPtrs. If you have any links that could help me, please share ;)
Nov 03 06:57:00 <tevaum>	There's a way to know if a value was garbage collected?
Nov 03 06:57:14 <tevaum>	*Is there*
Nov 03 07:02:48 <annulen>	tevaum: RefPtr: https://webkit.org/blog/5381/refptr-basics/
Nov 03 07:03:14 <tevaum>	annulen: I've already found that one. Thanks ;)
Nov 03 07:44:03 <KaL>	tevaum: what approach are you following in the end?
Nov 03 09:46:30 <tevaum>	KaL: I'm thinking. If we use those RefPtrs, values won't be garbage collected until we release them... But you said in the comments to that patch that we should free our values when JSValues were garbage collected...
Nov 03 09:47:52 <KaL>	tevaum: using RefPtr has nothing to do with the garbage collector, it's ony to avoid having to manually free/unref the objects
Nov 03 09:48:25 <KaL>	tevaum: another thing is how we handle our wrappers, and what happens if the objects are garbage collected
Nov 03 09:49:12 <KaL>	tevaum: with the patch you posted objects are never garbage collected, because you are protecting them, and the context is storing them but never releasing them
Nov 03 09:50:17 <KaL>	tevaum: but to not complicate things too much for this first patch, I suggest you to simply protect on construction and unprotect on destruction, and not keeping a ref internally
Nov 03 09:51:45 <tevaum>	KaL: yes. It's not releasing them because they are available to JavaScript on the page to access them... I think we should have a jsc_context_delete_value to release them...
Nov 03 09:52:24 <KaL>	tevaum: leave that way for now, we can discuss about the whole lifecycle of objects later
Nov 03 09:52:42 <tevaum>	Ok then
Nov 03 09:53:01 <KaL>	this way we can progress
Nov 04 04:23:16 <heftig>	KaL: could you please generate proper detached signatures for releases? the signed sha1 sums are really awkward to handle (besides being limited by the weak sha1)
Nov 04 04:24:29 <KaL>	heftig: honestly, I have no idea what I do :-P I have a script that does everything automatically, clopez was the last one who updated it
Nov 04 04:26:36 <heftig>	KaL: what are you doing currently?
Nov 04 04:28:53 <heftig>	I wish I could build straight from git, but that's unfortunately not simply an autogen.sh away
Nov 04 04:31:25 <KaL>	heftig: https://github.com/WebKitGTK/webkitgtk.org/blob/master/webkit-release#L704
Nov 04 04:33:47 <heftig>	hm, add something like
Nov 04 04:33:52 <heftig>	gpg2_file = tarball_file + ".asc"
Nov 04 04:33:56 <heftig>	subprocess.call(['gpg', '--armor', '--detach-sign', tarball_file])
Nov 04 04:34:14 <heftig>	and insert gpg2_file into the scp argument list
Nov 04 04:34:33 <heftig>	oh, and os.unlink(gpg2_file)
Nov 04 04:34:39 <heftig>	i think that's enough
Nov 04 04:37:00 <KaL>	heftig: could you propose that in the mailing list? I know clopez and mcatanzaro discussed aboout this last time, or wait for them to be here to discuss it with them
Nov 04 04:44:40 <heftig>	KaL: can I post without subscribing?
Nov 04 04:45:10 <KaL>	heftig: I can let your email pass
Nov 04 04:45:16 <heftig>	thanks.
Nov 04 05:01:54 <heftig>	KaL: sent
Nov 04 05:02:08 <KaL>	thanks! I'll check the queue
Nov 04 05:31:54 <bertogg>	heftig: thanks!

Nov 07 11:03:03 <kov>	clopez, o/ looking into it
Nov 07 11:50:23 <quinq>	Same build problem with 2.14.2
Nov 07 12:36:46 <quinq>	If I try to include HeapInlines.h, where the missing symbols are defined, I get some errors about JSArray not naming a type, although Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/JSArray.h seems to be included before that
Nov 08 06:43:52 <supervacuo>	Hi folks. I heard this may be a good place to ask for debugging advice / commiseration / potential workarounds for fairly frequent freezes I'm seeing in newly-upgraded-to Epiphany 3.22.1 (webkitgtk4-2.14.1-2.fc25.x86_64). Any thoughts?
Nov 08 07:15:22 <mcatanzaro>	It's the same problem rishi is having. rishi, could you link supervacuo to your bug report? (I have unfortunately deleted my browser history testing an ephy bug.)
Nov 08 07:35:24 <supervacuo>	mcatanzaro, rishi: thanks :)
Nov 08 07:39:24 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, supervacuo, rishi https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164052 or https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164049
Nov 08 07:49:13 <supervacuo>	tpopela: ah thanks. I did see those two in bugzilla, and have the `printwebkitmemory.sh` on hand for the next freeze
Nov 08 07:57:58 <KaL>	tpopela: btw, did you report the icecc issue to cmake in the end?
Nov 08 07:58:56 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos.. No I completely forgot about it and was going to report it today as during the update the newer cmake got installed and I faced the issue again..
Nov 08 07:59:27 <KaL>	yes, I have to downgrade after every upgrade :-P
Nov 08 07:59:54 <KaL>	danw: hey, I guess you are still the only one reviewing libsoup patches, right?
Nov 08 08:00:21 <danw>	yeah. i saw your stuff yesterday. i'll look at it soon
Nov 08 08:01:05 <KaL>	danw: great, thanks
Nov 08 08:01:27 <tpopela>	KaL, I will report it now..
Nov 08 08:01:32 <KaL>	I have this one pending too https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=773257
Nov 08 08:02:23 <tpopela>	KaL, did you tried 3.7.0-rc3?
Nov 08 08:02:41 <KaL>	tpopela: nope
Nov 08 08:02:50 <tpopela>	KaL, ok, I will try it..
Nov 08 08:02:52 <KaL>	debian always install 3.6.2 here , I think
Nov 08 09:59:27 <quinq>	Any idea why a link command ( http://sprunge.us/dhBI ) would tell me there's an include problem http://sprunge.us/ORJO ?
Nov 08 09:59:35 <quinq>	And which source would bring that in
Nov 08 10:00:32 <heftig>	it's not an include problem; the problem is that the functions the includes reference are missing
Nov 08 10:01:08 <heftig>	i.e. you're either missing objects in your link or the objects are missing the functions you need
Nov 08 10:02:01 <quinq>	But it's talking about function missing from a source file, not an object
Nov 08 10:02:14 <heftig>	for example there are places that call JSC::Heap::heap(JSC::HeapCell const*) but there is no implementation of JSC::Heap::heap(JSC::HeapCell const*) anywhere
Nov 08 10:02:18 <quinq>	And that's a linking command, not a compilation command
Nov 08 10:02:51 <heftig>	no, it's talking about functions (symbols) missing from object files
Nov 08 10:03:01 <quinq>	Core/runtime/JSCellInlines.h:106
Nov 08 10:03:04 <quinq>	not an object file :/
Nov 08 10:03:30 <heftig>	yes, the linker can tell you where in the code the place that calls it is
Nov 08 10:03:47 <quinq>	ah…
Nov 08 10:04:04 <quinq>	Couldn't it rather tell me what object misses it?
Nov 08 10:04:52 <heftig>	where it is doesn't matter, it just needs to be somewhere
Nov 08 10:04:58 <quinq>	Yeah well
Nov 08 10:06:27 <quinq>	If I include the file where they are defined, it creates an include loop
Nov 08 10:06:52 <quinq>	And then it complains (logically) that JSArray isn't defined
Nov 08 10:06:54 <heftig>	sounsd like you're missing include guards
Nov 08 10:07:24 <quinq>	Well, *I'm* not missing anything, that's the webkit2gtk release ^^
Nov 08 10:08:28 <quinq>	Thanks for the time though, heftig
Nov 08 10:08:32 <heftig>	hm; version of g++ and architecture?
Nov 08 10:09:06 <quinq>	gcc version 4.9.4 (GCC)
Nov 08 10:09:07 <quinq>	Target: x86_64-linux-musl
Nov 08 10:09:35 <mcatanzaro>	quinq: You are the musl enablement team; as you can imagine, nobody else tests that. Patches welcome
Nov 08 10:09:45 <quinq>	I'm trying to make a Debug build of it
Nov 08 10:09:54 <mcatanzaro>	The file does have #pragma once so include guards should not be an isuse
Nov 08 10:09:56 <mcatanzaro>	*issue
Nov 08 10:09:58 <quinq>	mcatanzaro, that's what I'm trying to do :)
Nov 08 10:10:38 <quinq>	mcatanzaro, which file does?
Nov 08 10:11:02 <mcatanzaro>	JSCellInlines.h:106
Nov 08 10:11:22 <quinq>	Hummm, Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/JSCellInlines.h doesn't
Nov 08 10:11:30 <mcatanzaro>	It doesn't??
Nov 08 10:12:01 <quinq>	“grep pragma Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/JSCellInlines.h” returns nothing
Nov 08 10:12:17 <quinq>	There are only ifdef guards
Nov 08 10:13:58 <mcatanzaro>	OK it's a recent change, anyway it's functional include guards either way
Nov 08 10:14:04 <quinq>	grep -rn 'pragma once' Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/|wc -l -> 12
Nov 08 10:14:11 <quinq>	ls -1 Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/*.h|wc -l -> 331
Nov 08 10:14:13 <mcatanzaro>	Maybe musl handles inline differently...?
Nov 08 10:15:48 <quinq>	It's a simple cmake build with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug, does that work for anybody?
Nov 08 10:16:04 <quinq>	(to be sure it's a local problem)
Nov 08 10:38:41 <blino>	quinq: can you give more details about the error message? there are probably more useful lines around
Nov 08 10:40:11 <quinq>	blino, I'm not sure about that, but I'll paste you the cmake step output anyway
Nov 08 10:41:17 <quinq>	http://sprunge.us/TSOE tell-me if that's not sufficient
Nov 08 10:44:04 <quinq>	I'm trying to get the include path back to see what/where's missing as I have no clue about which object includes JSCellInlines.h in the first place
Nov 08 10:46:25 <quinq>	ok actually 6 or 7 object do
Nov 09 06:49:33 <quinq>	Hi, news, I did attempt to build webkit2gtk debug target again, against glibc
Nov 09 06:49:38 <quinq>	I get the exact same error
Nov 09 06:50:54 <quinq>	So rathen than a musl issue, it looks more like nobody bothered to test Debug builds before releasing (and that for more than one release)
Nov 09 06:51:28 <quinq>	s/rathen/rather
Nov 09 06:51:40 <tpopela>	quinq, no-one was testing Debug builds before and I think the situation now is the same..
Nov 09 06:51:49 <quinq>	before what?
Nov 09 06:52:41 <quinq>	You mean ever?
Nov 09 06:52:45 <tpopela>	quinq, in the past nearly every WebKitGTK+ release where I tried to build a debug build had some problems (missing files, ..)..
Nov 09 06:52:51 <tpopela>	quinq, yes, ever
Nov 09 06:52:54 <quinq>	haha…
Nov 09 06:53:04 <quinq>	Why is it even available, then?
Nov 09 06:53:18 <tpopela>	quinq, is there a particular reason why you are not using the trunk?
Nov 09 06:53:38 <quinq>	tpopela, because I though a release would be less error-prone
Nov 09 06:53:55 <tpopela>	quinq, the released tarballs are meant to be compiled only as a Release build (as that is what is tested)..
Nov 09 06:53:58 <philn>	quinq: it's used by many WebKit developers and useful to catch bugs on the buildbots
Nov 09 06:54:59 <philn>	for releases i'm not sure it's useful though, the RELEASE and PRODUCTION (i think?) configs should be used
Nov 09 06:55:04 <quinq>	tpopela, could make sense (although I'm not sure why sources for a release couldn't be built for debugging), but then why is the targat available?
Nov 09 06:55:08 <tpopela>	quinq, also is there any particular reason why are you using the Debug target and not RelWithDebInfo for example?
Nov 09 06:55:31 <quinq>	No reason tpopela, is there any reason I should use it?
Nov 09 06:55:38 <quinq>	s/it/RelWithDebInfo
Nov 09 06:55:58 <tpopela>	quinq, no I'm trying to get why are you insisting on Debug..
Nov 09 06:56:18 <quinq>	Because I want to be able to backtrace under gdb with symbols info
Nov 09 06:56:48 <quinq>	I'm don't know what's the difference betwen a Debug build and a RelWithDebInfo build
Nov 09 06:56:51 <tpopela>	quinq, so use RelWithDebInfo target
Nov 09 06:56:56 <quinq>	(the later sounds more obscure though)
Nov 09 06:57:19 <philn>	ASSERTs won't be enabled in RelWithDebInfo for instance
Nov 09 06:57:27 <quinq>	ok tpopela, thanks for the hint, will it work?
Nov 09 06:57:51 <tpopela>	quinq, that one should.. it's just putting -O0 -g to FLAGS..
Nov 09 06:57:58 <quinq>	ok philn
Nov 09 06:58:24 <quinq>	philn, so Debug target should work when building trunk rather than a release?
Nov 09 06:58:33 <philn>	yes
Nov 09 06:58:39 <quinq>	I'll try both then
Nov 09 06:58:43 <philn>	in theory :P
Nov 09 06:58:47 <quinq>	Thanks for your help tpopela and philn :)
Nov 09 06:58:53 <tpopela>	quinq, so turning off optimizations and enabling debug info..
Nov 09 06:59:10 <philn>	we have a buildbot configured to use the Debug config
Nov 09 06:59:13 <quinq>	Yeah, that's basically what I wanted in the first place
Nov 09 08:38:06 <mcatanzaro>	To be fair it should really be POSSIBLE to do debug builds from tarballs, even if it's a bad idea
Nov 09 08:39:33 <annulen>	imo it's not a bad idea at all
Nov 09 08:39:53 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Debug builds crash constantly, there's no value to using them unless you're a WebKit developer
Nov 09 08:40:03 <mcatanzaro>	And if you're a WebKit developer you would not be using a tarball release....
Nov 09 08:40:43 <quinq>	I would have though crashing wouldn't be expected in a release but he
Nov 09 08:41:13 <mcatanzaro>	Debug = you opt in to assertions = crash crash crash
Nov 09 08:41:28 <mcatanzaro>	Not enough developers to fix common assertions
Nov 09 08:41:59 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: there may be users (or package maintainers) willing to do testing on their platforms
Nov 09 08:41:59 <quinq>	code fast, fix later
Nov 09 08:42:25 <quinq>	annulen, obviously
Nov 09 08:44:06 <quinq>	I wonder though what in the release process makes it impossible to build a Debug target
Nov 09 08:44:46 <philn>	nothing is impossible :)
Nov 09 08:45:58 <mcatanzaro>	philn: :(
Nov 09 08:46:01 <annulen>	it might be that some file is missing in manifest.txt
Nov 09 08:46:18 <mcatanzaro>	quinq: Feel free to submit a patch if you figure it out
Nov 09 08:46:30 *	mcatanzaro tries to continue with life
Nov 09 08:47:41 <quinq>	mcatanzaro, I've been trying for aproximately four days, I'm giving up ^^
Nov 09 08:48:37 <annulen>	quinq: try building from svn tag instead of tarball
Nov 09 08:49:07 <quinq>	Yes annulen, that has been recommended
Nov 09 08:49:33 <annulen>	ok
Nov 09 08:50:25 <quinq>	Also, what's the idea with having both headers ifdef guards and pragma once?
Nov 09 08:50:31 <quinq>	Well, not both, but mixed
Nov 09 08:50:48 <mcatanzaro>	quinq: They should be replaced with #pragma once when modifying the headers (except in public headers)
Nov 09 08:51:37 <quinq>	Any advantage there?
Nov 09 08:51:46 <quinq>	(I can see a disadvantage, making it less portable)
Nov 09 08:52:35 <mcatanzaro>	quinq: All modern compliers support #pragma once, you're not going to be able to build on any compiler that doesn't regardless
Nov 09 08:52:41 <mcatanzaro>	It's fewer characters :)
Nov 09 08:53:01 <quinq>	I'm talking about standards there
Nov 09 08:53:19 <annulen>	it's possible to get broken guard in case of typo in define of ifdef line
Nov 09 08:53:39 <quinq>	Well, any typo will break your code obviously
Nov 09 08:54:01 <annulen>	typo in pragma once won't compile
Nov 09 08:55:04 <quinq>	Why wouldn't it?
Nov 09 08:55:32 <quinq>	You're building with -Werror?
Nov 09 08:55:43 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Really? GCC ignores unknown pragmas right?
Nov 09 08:56:09 <quinq>	If you're building with -Werror, gcc will break your build too, because you'de be redifining symbols
Nov 09 08:56:18 <quinq>	(with ifdef guards I mean)
Nov 09 08:56:26 <quinq>	Right, mcatanzaro
Nov 09 08:57:04 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: yeah, my bad

Nov 10 11:12:13 <KaL>	we already made that mitake in DOM bindings
Nov 10 11:14:19 <calvaris{M}>	KaL: ok, you know more than me :)

Nov 10 11:22:12 <quinq>	Not sure why this happens yet, though
Nov 10 17:00:21 <tevaum>	Is there anything I should do to make style checker stop complaining about underscores?
Nov 10 17:02:31 <tevaum>	Or should I safely ignore them?
Nov 10 18:40:58 <mcatanzaro>	tevaum: If it's public API just ignore them
Nov 10 18:42:27 <tevaum>	mcatanzaro: I skipped those specific tests in checker.py :P
Nov 10 18:42:53 <tevaum>	Yes... It's just public API ;)
Nov 10 20:42:31 <antoyo>	Hello. I wonder how to use the function `webkit_dom_html_input_element_set_files` because it seems there is no way to create a WebKitDOMFileList. Can you help me? Thanks.
Nov 10 20:55:13 <antoyo>	Is there a way to set the value of an input[type="file"] from a string in a web extension?
Nov 10 20:56:10 <antoyo>	Or is there a way to click on an input[type="file"] from a web extension?
Nov 10 20:57:18 <mcatanzaro>	antoyo: Try asking tomorrow morning (when Europeans are online), you'll be more likely to get a response.
Nov 10 20:57:39 <mcatanzaro>	Looks like there's no API for creating other DOM collections, so it might be intentional....
Nov 10 21:20:03 <antoyo>	Thanks, I'll try tomorrow.
Nov 10 21:23:29 <antoyo>	Is it here the best place to ask such a question?
Nov 10 21:23:38 <mcatanzaro>	antoyo: Yes
Nov 11 15:19:51 <codebrainz>	hi. for webkit_web_view_load_string(), could someone explain what the `base_uri` parameter is used for and what it should contain?
Nov 11 15:20:14 <codebrainz>	I'm trying to use it, but Webkit seems to strip the last component off of it
Nov 11 15:20:26 <codebrainz>	*path component
Nov 11 15:20:46 <aperezdc>	codebrainz: it's used to determine which base URL to use for resources references in the loaded string using relative paths
Nov 11 15:21:31 <aperezdc>	for example, if the string you load has <img src='foo/bar.png'> in it, webkit will try to load <baseurl>/foo/bar.png
Nov 11 15:22:01 <codebrainz>	for some reason it's not working here, it strips the last piece of the path part off
Nov 11 15:22:31 <aperezdc>	probably it's intended to be passed with a trailing slash
Nov 11 15:22:37 <aperezdc>	and in that case it will remove only the slash (I imagine)
Nov 11 15:22:53 <aperezdc>	ahh, wait: now I get it
Nov 11 15:23:10 <aperezdc>	it's the URL from which the loaded string is "loaded"
Nov 11 15:23:28 <codebrainz>	oh, if it were to be a file kind of thing?
Nov 11 15:23:28 <aperezdc>	so you could pass something like file:///path/to/resources/index.html
Nov 11 15:23:29 <quinq>	webkit1 is deprecated anyway
Nov 11 15:23:54 <codebrainz>	let me try
Nov 11 15:23:55 <aperezdc>	and if your loaded string has <img src="foo.png"> you would get file:///path/to/resources/foo.png loaded
Nov 11 15:24:23 <aperezdc>	also, what quinq said: please do use WebKit2
Nov 11 15:24:38 <aperezdc>	:)
Nov 11 15:26:18 <codebrainz>	will probably conditionally start supporting it eventually
Nov 11 15:29:39 <aperezdc>	codebrainz: that's great! Out of curiosity: in which application are you using WebKitGTK+ are you working on?
Nov 11 15:29:59 <codebrainz>	aperezdc, it's a plugin for Geany editor which does live Markdown preview
Nov 11 15:30:21 <codebrainz>	https://github.com/geany/geany-plugins/tree/master/markdown
Nov 11 15:30:43 <aperezdc>	that kind of stuff is nice to have for editing Markdown, cool
Nov 11 15:30:46 <codebrainz>	aperezdc, that worked BTW, thanks a bunch
Nov 11 15:31:06 <aperezdc>	codebrainz: no prob, happy to help :)
Nov 11 15:42:20 <mcatanzaro>	codebrainz: FYI, geany-plugins will be removed from Fedora if you don't upgrade Real Soon Now: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1375807
Nov 11 15:43:04 <mcatanzaro>	Ah, Geany depends on GTK+ 2... you're screwed, basically, sorry. :/
Nov 11 15:43:18 <codebrainz>	we're not screwed, Fedora's users are :)
Nov 11 15:43:40 <codebrainz>	in debian each plugin is packaged separately, just that one plugin would have to be removed
Nov 11 15:43:46 <mcatanzaro>	You'd better hope other distros don't follow suit
Nov 11 15:44:20 <mcatanzaro>	codebrainz: Should be easy to do in Fedora too, but looks like the package maintainer has not responded to the bug. Oh well....
Nov 11 15:44:32 <codebrainz>	I'll ping him about it
Nov 11 15:44:38 <mcatanzaro>	Thanks
Nov 11 15:45:06 <codebrainz>	np
Nov 11 16:10:51 <heftig>	mcatanzaro: is there a list of open CVEs against 2.4.12?
Nov 11 16:10:57 <heftig>	er, 2.4.11
Nov 11 16:14:50 <mcatanzaro>	heftig: Nope, it's not supported and not worth the effort of tracking CVEs. You can use https://webkitgtk.org/security.html as a guide but of course there's no way to know which issues were introduced after 2.4

Nov 14 11:23:31 <ManDay>	Okay, so here is the funny thing!
Nov 14 11:23:35 <ManDay>	Very funny!

Nov 14 11:56:47 <antoyo>	I wonder how to use the function `webkit_dom_html_input_element_set_files` because it seems there is no way to create a WebKitDOMFileList.
Nov 14 11:56:49 <antoyo>	Can you help me?
Nov 14 11:56:51 <antoyo>	If it is not possible to set the files with this method, is there a way to click on an input[type="file"] from a web extension?
Nov 14 11:56:53 <antoyo>	Or is there a way to set the value of an input[type="file"] from a string in a web extension?
Nov 14 11:56:55 <antoyo>	Thanks.
Nov 14 12:28:57 <antoyo>	Is it normal that `webkit_navigation_action_get_modifiers()` always returns 0 for JavaScript event (even when ctrlKey is set to true)?
Nov 14 13:24:19 <antoyo>	Is there a way to click on an input[type="file"] from a web extension?
Nov 14 13:27:38 <antoyo>	Using `webkit_dom_html_element_click()` does not work for input[type="file"].
Nov 14 13:32:24 <antoyo>	Using dispatch_event() with a mouse click event does not work either.
Nov 14 13:34:44 <antoyo>	It seems there is a different behaviour between Chromium (Blink) and WebKit2: using click() does work on Chromium, but not on WebKit2. Is it normal?

Nov 15 03:48:53 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos what do we need from user when the WebKitGTK+ > 2.14 is very slow for them and only disabling the compositing mode helps them.. https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774067#c8 .. Actually is there a way to disable accelerated compositing for the default context? I'm thinking that we actually don't need AC at all in Evo..
Nov 15 03:52:30 <KaL>	tpopela: only using the env var
Nov 15 03:53:48 <KaL>	tpopela: maybe we should bring back the setting for that, we don't really need opengl for the evo composer
Nov 15 03:54:23 <tpopela>	KaL, ok, we will use the env var in the meantime..
Nov 15 03:55:22 <KaL>	tpopela: could you start a discussion about this in the mailing list? I know some people really wnated to remove the non AC mode eventually
Nov 15 03:55:43 <tpopela>	KaL, yes
Nov 15 03:55:47 <KaL>	thanks
Nov 15 04:00:18 <ManDay>	Does this  error mean anything to anyone? https://paste.pound-python.org/show/ZGrvIhQRu1wCApRXjkZ3/
Nov 15 04:01:23 <philn>	ManDay: looks like you need to rebuild Perl with threads support, if i read this correctly
Nov 15 04:02:09 <ManDay>	hm okay i ll try. I thought perl was only used for the build-system
Nov 15 04:04:07 <ManDay>	there seems to be something weirdly broken in webkits build system as of 2.15... the make just randomly terminates without stating an error (only the last line stats "recipe for target 'all' failed" but without giving an error"
Nov 15 04:04:19 <ManDay>	running make *again* then produces this perl error
Nov 15 04:04:27 <ManDay>	and running make *even again* proceeds with the build
Nov 15 04:05:11 <ManDay>	perhaps the person or people who keep messing with perl and the build system just let that be...
Nov 15 04:05:17 <ManDay>	that would be better for everyone
Nov 15 04:06:27 <ManDay>	oh and there is the third case where the perl error appears but the build goes on
Nov 15 04:06:34 <ManDay>	I think it has to do with -j>1
Nov 15 04:07:12 <ManDay>	yeah indeed i now it a spot where even repeated invocations of "make" won't pass the perl error. but with -j1 it moves on
Nov 15 04:07:54 <ManDay>	compiling make -j1 now
Nov 15 04:09:40 <tpopela>	KaL, sent..
Nov 15 04:11:09 <philn>	ManDay: we don't use make so much anymore, most of us switched to ninja
Nov 15 04:11:55 <ManDay>	what's wrong with make?
Nov 15 04:22:03 <philn>	ManDay: we had issues in the past due to the size of the webkit project to build, and it's slow
Nov 15 04:22:09 <KaL>	tpopela: thanks, already replied
Nov 15 04:22:50 <fujihiro>	ManDay: Could you file a bug? Please describe which Linux distro you use and how many CPUs in the bug.
Nov 15 04:25:23 <ManDay>	philn: oh ok. i did not imagine "make" imposed any limitations on the size of the project. but i very much assume the overhead associated with "make being slow" is neglibible in comparison to actual compile time
Nov 15 04:25:25 <ManDay>	fujihiro: ok
Nov 15 04:26:21 <ManDay>	but cmake produces make files. how do you get it to produce "ninja" files?
Nov 15 04:27:46 <ManDay>	oh i c there is a ninja backend for cmake
Nov 15 04:29:14 <fujihiro>	ManDay: 'build-webkit' uses CMake Ninja generator if 'ninja' or 'ninja-build' command exists.
Nov 15 04:29:51 <philn>	you need to invoke cmake with -G Ninja
Nov 15 04:34:37 <ManDay>	but i assume ninja will not rid the build process of perl ;-/
Nov 15 04:36:15 <annulen>	using threads in perl was a stupid idea
Nov 15 04:36:42 <annulen>	ManDay: you can try to use forks module
Nov 15 04:36:51 <annulen>	it's a drop in replacement for threads
Nov 15 04:37:02 <annulen>	http://search.cpan.org/~rybskej/forks-0.36/lib/forks.pm
Nov 15 04:45:03 <annulen>	ManDay: you just need to add -Mforks where generate-bindings-all.pl is called
Nov 15 04:50:26 <ManDay>	annulen: I added -Mforks behind the call to generate-bindings-all.pl in WebCore/CMakeFiles/WebCoreBindings.dir/build.make but the make still fails with "This Perl not built to support threads"
Nov 15 04:52:12 <ManDay>	(i rather think using perl in the make system was a silly idea, btw ;-|)
Nov 15 04:52:56 <annulen>	build.make is not used
Nov 15 04:53:13 <annulen>	oh sorry
Nov 15 04:53:19 <annulen>	it's used but its generated
Nov 15 04:53:56 <annulen>	you need to change Source/cmake/WebKitMacros.cmake
Nov 15 04:54:20 <ManDay>	well, as long as it's not *Regenerated*... The change with -Mforks I did is retained, it just didn'T work...
Nov 15 04:54:31 <ManDay>	Anyway, I'm compiling perl with threads now, hope that helps
Nov 15 04:55:17 <annulen>	behind?
Nov 15 04:55:28 <ManDay>	behind what?
Nov 15 04:55:29 <annulen>	you should add it before generate-bindings-all.pl
Nov 15 04:55:34 <annulen>	not behind
Nov 15 04:55:41 <ManDay>	oh, too late
Nov 15 04:55:44 <ManDay>	it already works
Nov 15 04:55:52 <annulen>	ok
Nov 15 04:56:56 <ManDay>	however portage prints a warning upon compiling perl that "interpreter-level thread is enabled but not supported by all apps that compile against perl. you use threading at your own discretion"... I guess that's what you meant by stupid idea...
Nov 15 05:00:45 <annulen>	ok, I guess intention was to parallelize it on Windows, where fork is emulated
Nov 15 05:00:53 *	annulen takes back "stupid"
Nov 15 05:05:58 <tpopela>	KaL, so one of these users that do have problems with AC in Evo is running under VirtualBox..
Nov 15 06:05:14 <tpopela>	KaL, and the other one is using the modesetting driver.. when he switches to the intel driver, everything is OK..
Nov 15 06:05:39 <tpopela>	KaL, do we have something to disable the AC based on driver?
Nov 15 06:05:52 <KaL>	no, but we probably should
Nov 15 06:13:59 <ManDay>	so fwiw, i still get a crash on any sort of popup dialog
Nov 15 06:14:14 <ManDay>	(in 2.15)
Nov 15 07:33:00 <ManDay>	2.15 seems to have some other bugs (not sure they were there before) - for example JS seems to ramdomly fail
Nov 15 07:42:12 <annulen>	ManDay: nothing surprising, it's trunk
Nov 15 07:43:27 <annulen>	e.g. pizlo rewrites gc and it can backfire
Nov 15 07:44:55 <ManDay>	ah okay, thanks annulen - might wanna stick to stable then ^^
Nov 15 07:45:49 <ManDay>	until yesterday i still had my old computer with X11 and firefox and all the bells and whistles as fall-back, but as of today, I only have my main box left and minibrowser is my only graphical browser
Nov 15 07:46:00 <ManDay>	so i need it to be as reliable as it can be :)
Nov 15 07:46:53 <annulen>	use TTY and elinks, it's much more stable than this gui crap
Nov 15 07:47:40 <ManDay>	i'd have agreed 10 years ago, but these days most pages no longer care for text compat
Nov 15 07:47:51 <ManDay>	let alone I also use youtube etc
Nov 15 07:48:21 <ManDay>	well, tbh i doubt they cared all that much 10 years ago
Nov 15 07:57:36 <ManDay>	i might be mistaken but I think downloading doesn't work in 2.15 minibrowser, either
Nov 15 08:01:24 <annulen>	ManDay: is that principal for you to use webkitgtk, or you just need browser that works on wayland?
Nov 15 08:02:11 <ManDay>	annulen: actually i only need a browser (with a reasonable amount of dependencies that is - for example no KDE based one)
Nov 15 08:03:24 <annulen>	is Qt w/o KDE fine?
Nov 15 08:09:47 <annulen>	ManDay: you might want to try revived QtWebKit with Otter Browser or Qutebrowser on top of it
Nov 15 08:13:25 <mcatanzaro>	Downloading is undergoing some refactoring, I guess it might be broken in 2.15.1
Nov 15 08:27:07 <KaL>	is broken yes
Nov 15 08:27:16 <KaL>	fixed in trunk
Nov 15 09:09:51 <ManDay>	btw, would you mind patching eglplatform.h in ANGLE?
Nov 15 09:10:12 <ManDay>	To contain the #ifndef MESA_EGL_NO_X11_HEADERS
Nov 15 09:10:24 <ManDay>	i always have to patch this myself
Nov 15 09:14:07 <tpopela>	KaL, btw there is the bug for the cmake issue.. I'm trying to ping the maintainer to push it to upstream.. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1394152
Nov 15 09:16:11 <ManDay>	same thing for waylandcompositor.cpp, btw
Nov 15 15:44:12 <aperezdc>	question: does WebKitGTK+ do some kind of d-bus calls into NetworkDamager to determine whether the connection goes away or coms back (e.g. when suspending the computer)? I have this case where a webapp running inside an embedded WebKitWebView usually detects just fine when the network is back, but when running in the Flatpak sandbox it never notices
Nov 15 15:44:40 <mcatanzaro>	aperezdc: I don't think so, no
Nov 15 15:45:14 <mcatanzaro>	If we wanted to show some network status indicator, then we'd need to do that, but instead we just assume the network is always working and show an error page when a host is unreachable
Nov 15 15:45:24 <aperezdc>	well, then I'll have to try debugging harder, instead
Nov 15 15:45:33 <aperezdc>	mcatanzaro: thanks for commenting :-)
Nov 15 15:45:44 <mcatanzaro>	Anyway the flatpak sandbox surely has a hole for D-Bus, right?
Nov 15 16:14:01 <aperezdc>	mcatanzaro: yes, one has to provide an explicit listing of the D-Bus paths that a sandboxed application may talk to, and also the ones provided by the application which will be allowed to be exposed to the session bus
Nov 16 07:54:25 <keis>	what would be the best way of scrolling the webkit view (main frame?) with the api?
Nov 16 07:59:31 <heftig>	apparently there is no such api
Nov 16 07:59:37 <quinq>	There's a shorthand function in the unstable API
Nov 16 07:59:47 <quinq>	But it's… In the unstable API
Nov 16 08:00:23 <keis>	and is that at some point going to become an stable API?
Nov 16 08:00:40 <quinq>	I have no idea, I'm not part of the project ^^
Nov 16 08:00:46 <quinq>	I wish it would though
Nov 16 08:01:00 <keis>	aha ok :P
Nov 16 08:01:13 <keis>	got a link to that?
Nov 16 08:01:28 <quinq>	https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkitdomgtk/unstable/index.html
Nov 16 08:02:01 <keis>	oh it's in the dom. ofc
Nov 16 08:03:08 <keis>	ty
Nov 16 08:03:18 <quinq>	Oh yes, there isn't any in the webkitgtk api
Nov 16 08:05:54 <quinq>	https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkitdomgtk/unstable/WebKitDOMDOMWindow.html#webkit-dom-dom-window-scroll-by
Nov 16 08:08:14 <keis>	yep. looks like that should work
Nov 16 08:11:30 <quinq>	You're planning on shipping an app using an unstable API?
Nov 16 08:12:16 <keis>	we're already abusing the dom api for some stuff
Nov 16 08:18:09 <quinq>	ok :)
Nov 16 08:18:48 <quinq>	Out of curiosity, could you say what this is for?
Nov 16 08:30:02 <keis>	uzbl https://github.com/uzbl/uzbl
Nov 16 08:36:55 <quinq>	ok :)
Nov 16 10:08:45 <aidanh>	Is there any good way of getting a WebKitDOMElement's JSValueRef, short of building a unique selector for it and calling document.querySelector?

Nov 17 05:04:03 <purejava>	I want to use webkitgtk with vala but can't get the cmake right: http://pastebin.com/3dNKvnX9
Nov 17 05:04:10 <purejava>	make fails with: error: Package `webkitgtk-3.0' not found in specified Vala API directories or GObject-Introspection GIR directories
Nov 17 07:02:47 <heftig>	purejava: try webkitgtk-4.0
Nov 17 07:03:12 <heftig>	purejava: er, sorry, webkit2gtk-4.0
Nov 17 07:04:25 <heftig>	you definitely don't want to use webkitgtk-3.0 or webkitgtk-2.0 because those come from webkitgtk 2.4, which is old and full of vulnerabilities
Nov 17 09:18:18 <purejava>	heftig: yeah, I know. I have to fix something in an webkitgtk (1) app and can't migrate yet.
Nov 18 07:56:37 <mcatanzaro>	Hi tpopela, I notice you didn't make a bodhi update for 2.14.2, is it to wait for F25 to be unfrozen?
Nov 18 11:30:45 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: How do I CC you on rbz :(
Nov 18 11:30:48 <mcatanzaro>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1396009
Nov 18 11:31:16 <mcatanzaro>	User insists that whether copy-paste works is workspace-dependent: "I cannot paste into the epiphany URL bar from evolution on a different workspace, no matter what I try."
Nov 18 11:31:59 <mcatanzaro>	And KaL: "(possibly related, launching two epiphany windows on different workspaces makes
Nov 18 11:32:02 <mcatanzaro>	epiphany crawl.)" ...really...?
Nov 18 11:33:11 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: cgarnach@... :)
Nov 18 11:35:30 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: I tbh saw that once, when I first switched back from compiled webkit to f25 ones after the clipboard change made it to tarballs, never since then. I assumed it got fixed in the mean time
Nov 18 11:37:27 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: what IIRC happened is that it waited for a frame callback that wouldn't happen until you switch to the browser workspace again, so the wayland source didn't get throttled, and no further events were handled
Nov 18 11:37:53 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: Your email would be so much easier to remember with one more letter at the end :(
Nov 18 11:38:14 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: Wow, it really IS workspace-dependent
Nov 18 11:38:27 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: wholeheartedly agreed...
Nov 18 11:38:36 <mcatanzaro>	Aaaaand could that explain why running ephy's UI process on two different workspaces is reported to suck?
Nov 18 11:38:53 <mcatanzaro>	(Rember two ephy windows = just one process usually)
Nov 18 11:39:21 <mcatanzaro>	I should believe bug reporters more often.
Nov 18 11:48:22 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: no idea about that one... supposedly a frame callback not running would just affect the surface it notifies about
Nov 18 19:22:53 <blino>	annulen: btw, how you do review the diff to previous patches? is there some tool for this?
Nov 18 19:23:36 <annulen>	you mean diff between versions of patch? yeah, I lack gerrit :)
Nov 18 19:26:05 <blino>	yes
Nov 18 19:30:53 <annulen>	visually
Nov 18 19:33:28 <blino>	ok, this one is pretty simple to review, but when many files are modified, this is very tedious
Nov 18 19:33:41 <blino>	gerrit is nice indeed for Qt projects
Nov 18 19:34:23 <annulen>	I think we could roll something for bugzilla, just nobody bothered
Nov 19 02:56:25 <philn>	blino: bugzilla has interdiff support
Nov 19 03:34:23 <blino>	ah, ok, thanks
Nov 19 03:55:09 <philn>	it's well hidden and you can view only, not add comments like in the usual patch review
Nov 19 03:59:26 <blino>	philn: yep, found it
Nov 19 03:59:46 <blino>	with the default patch names (just "Patch"), that's not very practical though
Nov 19 04:03:21 <blino>	WPE is getting pretty close to upstream, that's great :)
Nov 20 08:12:27 <ManDay>	Will this crash on a Context Menu be looked at by anyone?
Nov 20 08:12:38 <ManDay>	I've filed a bug with GTK and received no response whatsoever
Nov 20 09:10:24 <ManDay>	yeah great
Nov 21 06:56:33 <tevaum>	KaL: you pointed an empty dir TestWebKitAPI/Tests/JavaScriptCore, but it's not present on my clone...
Nov 21 06:56:43 <tevaum>	Is that the correct path?
Nov 21 07:02:39 <annulen>	looks like you need to create it again, it's gone since r182871
Nov 21 07:02:43 <annulen>	Tools/TestWebKitAPI/Tests/JavaScriptCore
Nov 21 07:11:18 <tevaum>	OK. Tks, annulen ;)

Nov 21 11:33:42 <ManDay>	I know, and I don't expect the crash to be fixed. I understand I'm the only person who cares about MiniBrowser (but doesn't contribute to it, shame on me), so just for my information: Is it normal that youtube playback stops if the Minibrowser window is not mapped for like 20 seconds?
Nov 21 11:34:19 <mcatanzaro>	no that would be a bad bug
Nov 21 11:34:34 <ManDay>	Not worse than the crash haha
Nov 21 11:34:41 <ManDay>	But thanks for the warming words! :)
Nov 21 11:34:51 <mcatanzaro>	what crash?
Nov 21 11:35:31 <ManDay>	minibrowser can't display context-menu or <select> popups (i think that's more a webkit or even gtk problem, but I only have minibrowser to report it)
Nov 21 11:35:42 <ManDay>	it crashes immediately
Nov 21 11:35:57 <mcatanzaro>	epiphany works
Nov 21 11:36:07 <ManDay>	on GLES2?
Nov 21 11:36:19 <mcatanzaro>	oh no, nobody uses that but you :P
Nov 21 11:36:25 <ManDay>	yeah, i figured xD
Nov 21 11:37:00 <ManDay>	well, i guess when mesa brings gl support to wayland that will be sorted
Nov 21 11:37:08 <ManDay>	so 2017 will be aaaaaalll good

Nov 23 10:30:35 <clopez>	is the ews still broken? i think is fine, if not please ping me
Nov 23 10:30:52 <clopez>	tevaum: ^
Nov 23 10:31:24 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, Hi Michael! :) Do you have some bug WK for slow clipboard in WebKitGTK+ on Wayland?
Nov 23 10:31:56 <philn>	clopez: i pinged Loren, but dunno if he finally did the cleanup
Nov 23 10:32:08 <clopez>	i did a cleanup already yesterday
Nov 23 10:32:22 <philn>	on his EWS ?
Nov 23 10:32:25 <clopez>	yes
Nov 23 10:32:31 <clopez>	maybe i should rename the ews
Nov 23 10:32:34 <philn>	heh.. ok then
Nov 23 10:32:37 <philn>	yes please
Nov 23 10:32:46 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1394993 item number two.. but I can reproduce it locally as well..
Nov 23 10:40:52 <tevaum>	clopez: how can I check? Resubmitting the patch?
Nov 23 10:41:05 <clopez>	tevaum: which bug is?
Nov 23 10:41:17 <tevaum>	164061
Nov 23 10:41:53 <clopez>	tevaum: yes, you have tu upload again the patch
Nov 23 10:42:16 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Yes
Nov 23 10:42:39 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164983
Nov 23 10:42:50 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, thanks! :)
Nov 23 10:42:54 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: I actually have to Ctrl+V Alt+Tab Alt+Tab just to paste that bug URL for you :p
Nov 23 10:43:15 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, and I had to rewrite it :D
Nov 23 10:43:21 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, hard times for us :D
Nov 23 10:43:37 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Also long combo boxes do not show the arrows
Nov 23 10:43:44 <mcatanzaro>	Really hard to scroll combo boxes :(
Nov 23 10:43:54 <mcatanzaro>	And gtk_window_present() doesn't work at all :(
Nov 23 10:44:21 <mcatanzaro>	But on the whole things are pretty good, I think it was right to make the switch
Nov 23 10:46:05 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, yeah I'm using it for a week now (previously I switched away in few hours) and I have to admit that they improve it a lot..
Nov 23 10:46:41 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Except for this "epiphany crashes seven times in a row on start" bug, fixed in some GTK+ update that hasn't materialized yet :(
Nov 23 10:46:58 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, 3.22.3 I think
Nov 23 10:47:16 <tevaum>	clopez: done... Let's wait and see... ;)
Nov 23 10:47:45 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, I was not reproduce it here, but jeischma everytime he tried to forwards mail as attachment in Evo..
Nov 23 10:49:58 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, do you know who can give me rights to edit the bugzilla? I wanted to add a new link to See Also, but I can't do it :)
Nov 23 10:51:04 <annulen>	tpopela: write to committers mailing list
Nov 23 10:51:31 <tpopela>	annulen, thanks!
Nov 23 10:51:35 <tevaum>	clopez: wow... That was fast... Did it really build the patch :P
Nov 23 10:51:46 <tevaum>	And thanks for the fix ;)
Nov 23 10:51:51 <annulen>	tpopela: or ping lforschler

Nov 28 10:06:07 <kov>	clopez, there's an office move going on at collabora and that'll cause the arm bot to stay down for a while =/
Nov 28 10:42:20 <clopez>	kov: ok.. thanks for the info :)
Nov 29 04:33:16 <rishi>	tpopela: Hey! The webkitgtk4 scratch build that you submitted for me failed: http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=16595876
Nov 29 04:33:19 <rishi>	"webkitgtk-2.14.2/Source/WebCore/page/MemoryRelease.cpp:42:24: fatal error: StyleScope.h: No such file or directory"
Nov 29 04:33:39 <tpopela>	rishi, yeah I know.. But I didn't have time to look at it again..
Nov 29 04:33:50 <tpopela>	rishi, let me look at it right now..
Nov 29 04:37:57 <rishi>	tpopela: It's ok. No need to rush. I just wanted to let you know.
Nov 29 05:55:05 <tpopela>	rishi, ok, the build succeeded locally -> going to build it in koji.
Nov 29 05:56:33 <tpopela>	rishi, http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=16668227
Nov 29 05:57:11 <rishi>	tpopela: Great, thanks. Could you also submit a F24 build?
Nov 29 05:57:55 <tpopela>	rishi, you don't use f25? :)
Nov 29 05:58:58 <tpopela>	rishi, f24 - http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=16668274
Nov 29 05:59:17 <rishi>	tpopela: The F25 laptop is in the office, and I have F24 at home. Plus, I added some swap to the F25 system when I changed the HDD to see if that affects this. The F24 is still without swap.
Nov 29 05:59:34 <tpopela>	rishi, ah ok :)
Nov 29 05:59:40 <rishi>	:)
Nov 29 06:30:44 <garnacho__>	KaL: hey :), https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164983 is turning more and more into a rendering problem to my eyes, would be nice if you shared your thoughts too
Nov 29 07:55:50 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro,
Nov 29 07:56:01 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, Hi Michael some background for https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774596#c2 ?
Nov 29 08:00:44 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: If you use the same workaround then maybe it's the GTK+ bug after all? :)
Nov 29 08:00:52 <mcatanzaro>	I dunno much about this
Nov 29 08:01:03 <mcatanzaro>	Other than that the WebKit API is terrible
Nov 29 08:01:12 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, me neither..
Nov 29 08:02:04 <mcatanzaro>	Font size is probably our worst API by far, whoever exposed font size really messed up as the rest of the API is really nice IMO.
Nov 29 08:12:18 <KaL>	garnacho__: I need to look at it in more detail, I'm not sure I understand the problem yet
Nov 29 08:12:35 <KaL>	garnacho__: we don't use sync to vblank FWIW
Nov 29 08:13:29 <KaL>	lunch time, brb
Nov 29 08:35:21 <garnacho__>	KaL, mcatanzaro: actually... I don't need webkit to reproduce https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164983 :/. this is gtk+
Nov 29 08:35:35 <mcatanzaro>	yay
Nov 29 08:35:52 <mcatanzaro>	also: surprise?
Nov 29 08:38:01 <garnacho__>	mcatanzaro: given I need the "OpenGL area" demo to reproduce, yes :)
Nov 29 09:04:52 <tpopela>	rishi, builds are ready ;)
Nov 29 09:05:37 <garnacho__>	mcatanzaro, KaL: turns out there was https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769835
Nov 29 09:06:05 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho__: Great find. I'll close the WebKit bug then?
Nov 29 09:08:06 <garnacho__>	mcatanzaro: yeah I guess, there doesn't seem to be anything to fix here
Nov 29 09:38:04 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: Does that also explain https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164985?
Nov 29 09:44:13 <garnacho__>	mcatanzaro: yeah, I think so, with the difference that the blocked state of the unmapped surface can be seen on a window in the current workspace
Nov 29 09:47:34 *	KaL is happy he doesn't have to deal with that :-P
Nov 29 09:48:04 *	mcatanzaro is happy garnacho__ exists :-P
Nov 29 09:50:49 <garnacho__>	:)
Nov 29 09:51:16 *	garnacho__ happy too, no need to compile WebKit this time \o/
Nov 29 09:51:33 <KaL>	:-D
Nov 29 09:51:52 <KaL>	garnacho__: it's good to keep your room warm these days, though
Nov 29 09:52:17 <garnacho__>	haha, indeed
Nov 29 13:54:04 <aperezdc>	wtf: building GTK+ in the webkitgtk jhbuild...
Nov 29 13:54:04 <aperezdc>	checking for cups-config... /usr/bin/cups-config
Nov 29 13:54:05 <aperezdc>	configure: error: CUPS >= 1.2 not found
Nov 29 13:54:28 <aperezdc>	but: % cups-config --version
Nov 29 13:54:28 <aperezdc>	2.2.1
Nov 29 13:55:22 <aperezdc>	probably the version of GTK+ in the jhbuild is checking that the major version of CUPS is 1
Nov 29 13:55:54 <aperezdc>	should we add cups 1.2.x to the jhbuild? or maybe we can build gtk+ in the jhbuild without cups support (is that even possible?)
Nov 29 13:57:00 <mcatanzaro>	aperezdc: rego has a bug report about that somewhere. I think it's not fixed yet because all the patches so far had problems and nobody is paid to make it work. :)
Nov 29 13:57:04 <aperezdc>	ah, yes, there is --disable-cups
Nov 29 13:57:19 <mcatanzaro>	We're not gonna use --disable-cups :P
Nov 29 13:57:28 *	aperezdc  wonders what can break in WebKitGTK+ by disabling CUPS suppoer
Nov 29 13:57:31 <aperezdc>	*support
Nov 29 13:57:36 <mcatanzaro>	printing...?
Nov 29 13:57:54 <aperezdc>	ah, right, WebKitGTK+ can print, I keep forgetting that
Nov 29 13:57:58 <aperezdc>	O:-)
Nov 29 13:58:28 <aperezdc>	nobody prints webpages anymore, right? how about we remove the whole printing support? :D
Nov 29 13:58:32 <aperezdc>	(trololol)
Nov 29 13:59:24 <aperezdc>	ah, found the culprit in GTK+'s configure.ac:
Nov 29 13:59:32 <aperezdc>	   if test $CUPS_API_MAJOR -gt 1 -o \
Nov 29 13:59:33 <aperezdc>	           $CUPS_API_MAJOR -eq 1 -a $CUPS_API_MINOR -lt 2; then
Nov 29 13:59:34 <aperezdc>	     AC_MSG_ERROR([CUPS >= 1.2 not found])
Nov 29 13:59:56 <aperezdc>	the error message is deceiving, should say "CUPS >= 1.2 < 2.0"
Nov 29 13:59:58 <aperezdc>	xD
Nov 29 14:00:14 *	aperezdc  searches for the issue in bugzilla
Nov 29 14:01:10 <annulen>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163689
Nov 29 14:02:12 <aperezdc>	annulen: thanks!
Nov 29 14:06:16 <aperezdc>	what if we just add CUPS 1.x to the moduleset?
Nov 29 14:07:45 <annulen>	I think it would be better to backport patch to gtk
Nov 29 14:07:45 <aperezdc>	in my head that sounds like the build and runtime environment would be even more fixed and reproducible, less dependant on whatever is installed in the system
Dec 01 03:57:30 <tpopela>	KaL, clopez Hi, KaL any idea about https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165237 ? Thanks clopez that you figured out that it is tight to the AC.. I faced it in the last week several times, but I didn't have time to look at it :/
Dec 01 03:58:39 <KaL>	tpopela: are you sure it worked before? I think the inspector requires AC
Dec 01 04:00:10 <tpopela>	KaL, last week I turned off the AC for Evolution.. :/
Dec 01 04:00:31 <tpopela>	KaL, as it's broken for quite a few people..
Dec 01 04:01:22 <KaL>	I think it's a good idea, but I wonder if the inspector worked without AC before
Dec 01 04:01:30 <tpopela>	KaL, I'm curious why it needs it :/
Dec 01 04:01:41 <tpopela>	KaL, ah that's the question I can't answer :/
Dec 01 04:01:47 <KaL>	it uses page overlays that I think require AC
Dec 01 04:02:40 <tpopela>	ah ok..
Dec 01 04:08:22 <ManDay>	When Webkit (GTK) uses GStreamer for video playback, where would I have to start to make Gstreamer connect to jack ports different than "system:playback_*" ?
Dec 01 04:13:14 <philn>	ManDay: webkit uses autoaudiosink, i don't think the jack connection can be configured easily
Dec 01 04:34:44 <ManDay>	philn: so if someone were to implement this, would it be rather gstreamer or wk?
Dec 01 04:36:17 <philn>	you could add some hacks in webkit for that i suppose
Dec 01 04:36:30 <ManDay>	thanks philn :)
Dec 01 04:39:15 <philn>	ManDay: i have no idea about that jack stuff, isn't there some sandalone UI to configure the connections?
Dec 01 04:39:34 <ManDay>	philn: yes, but only after they were established
Dec 01 04:40:07 <ManDay>	(and yes there are also jack session implementations which do that automatically and "listen" for changes, but that's a whole bunch of setup to do)
Dec 01 04:40:59 <ManDay>	its most convenient if the port is chosen by the app (like mpd can be configured to use a specific port)
Dec 01 04:43:50 <philn>	exposing WebKit API to configure audio sinks sounds like a bad idea
Dec 01 04:44:05 <philn>	that kind of things should work out of the box...
Dec 01 08:09:47 <KaL>	hey danw, any plan to make an unstable soup release? I'm waiting for a new release to use it in wk jhbuild with the clear credentials patch to fix some flaky tests
Dec 01 08:11:11 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: hey KaL, is it possible that the plugin process dlopens plugins before creating the PlatformDisplay? Then the PlatformDisplay creation could get messed up if the plugin decides to play with the DISPLAY environment variable, for instance
Dec 01 08:11:35 <danw>	KaL: ok... i should be able to do that soon i guess
Dec 01 08:11:38 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: the platform display issue is not in the plugin process, but in the web process
Dec 01 08:12:55 <KaL>	danw: cool thanks, and if you could re-review the SOUP_MESSAGE_DO_NOT_USE_AUTH_CACHE patch to also include it in the release, it would be great
Dec 01 08:13:02 <danw>	ok
Dec 01 08:14:03 <KaL>	I have also this one pending https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=773257, but that doesn't affect the API, so I would be happy if it's fixed the next stable :-)
Dec 02 03:55:50 <aleray>	hi, I'm trying to build webkitgtk on my arch linux computer. I get an error: http://dpaste.com/22PJDHQ
Dec 02 03:56:13 <aleray>	Altought I installed gst-plugins-openwebrtc and openwebrtc
Dec 02 03:56:17 <aleray>	Any idea?
Dec 02 04:05:49 <philn>	aleray: you shouldn't enable webrtc/mediastream, those features are highly experimental
Dec 02 04:06:53 <aleray>	philn, thanks. I just run `WEBKIT_OUTPUTDIR=`pwd`/build/gtk Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --gtk --release`. How can I disable  webrtc/mediastream ?
Dec 02 04:07:19 <philn>	anyway it seems your jhbuild isn't up-to-date? did you run Tools/Scripts/update-webkitgtk-libs ?
Dec 02 04:13:36 <aleray>	philn, it gives me another error: http://dpaste.com/1MYQEKE
Dec 02 04:14:16 <philn>	aleray: try to run it with python2 ?
Dec 02 04:15:05 <philn>	hum :)
Dec 02 04:15:09 <aleray>	philn, that's a perl script
Dec 02 04:15:15 <philn>	yes
Dec 02 04:15:20 <aleray>	but it seems to call another script indeed
Dec 02 04:16:25 <philn>	try: python2 Tools/jhbuild/jhbuild-wrapper --gtk build
Dec 02 04:24:12 <aleray>	thanks
Dec 02 04:56:28 <tpopela>	KaL, Hey Carlos, would you mind if I rework the https://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebKit2/UIProcess/gtk/WebPreferencesGtk.cpp#L54 so it look whether it is actually enabled "WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1" so when user will have it defined as "WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=0" the we won't turn the AC off? Because if a user wants to have the AC enabled, there is now way for us in Evolution to leave it enabled.. We use
Dec 02 04:56:28 <tpopela>	g_setenv (https://git.gnome.org/browse/evolution/tree/src/shell/main.c#n599) with overwrite parameter set to FALSE (so it will preserve the user defined env veriables), but it will always turn the AC off because of the check of the WebKitGTK+ side..
Dec 02 04:58:22 <KaL>	tpopela: sounds reasonable, I still think we should add api for that instead of messing with env vars, though
Dec 02 04:59:44 <tpopela>	KaL, definitely.. I will do that on Monday..
Dec 02 05:12:27 <rishi>	tpopela: So, I haven't had a freeze yet with your builds.
Dec 02 05:12:54 <tpopela>	rishi, nice to hear that! :) KaL ^
Dec 02 05:13:25 <KaL>	\o/
Dec 02 05:16:12 <tpopela>	rishi, note that into the bug - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164052
Dec 02 05:16:58 <rishi>	tpopela: I will. Let me try it out for a few more hours.
Dec 02 05:17:10 <tpopela>	rishi, np :)
Dec 02 05:17:19 <rishi>	Thanks for the builds, tpopela !
Dec 02 05:17:46 <tpopela>	rishi, that was the easy thing, thank you for testing :)
Dec 02 05:35:48 <tevaum>	rishi: when you update the bug could you please post the link of the build that worked? :P
Dec 02 05:40:01 <tpopela>	tevaum, I will update it..
Dec 02 05:40:17 <tpopela>	KaL, can you please look at https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165298 ?
Dec 02 05:40:34 <tevaum>	tpopela: thanks ;)
Dec 02 05:43:28 <tpopela>	tevaum, np :)
Dec 02 06:02:10 <aleray>	philn the scripts says that  I'm missing cups > 1.2 although I have cups 2.2.1 installed http://dpaste.com/38FJYTP
Dec 02 06:05:42 <kov>	aleray, philn, I just noticed that problem myself, the configure.ac check for gtk is b0rked
Dec 02 06:06:03 <annulen>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163689
Dec 02 06:06:17 <kov>	I guess it's a good opportunity for us to update gtk
Dec 02 06:06:56 <annulen>	it was tried but was rolled out, see bug
Dec 02 06:11:44 <kov>	annulen, yeah, I meant updating gtk and doing the necessary gardening
Dec 02 06:15:23 <kov>	rego, did this not work? https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=292102&action=review
Dec 02 06:35:42 <rego>	kov: yeah both patches work but there were some regressions on layout tests so they were rolled out
Dec 02 06:35:55 <rego>	and I didn't find to investigate that further at that point
Dec 02 06:36:02 <rego>	and then forget about the issue :/
Dec 02 06:36:16 <kov>	rego, whoa… even the patch that just patches gtk to make the correct check caused regressions?
Dec 02 06:36:33 <rego>	kov: that patch needs the glib bump
Dec 02 06:36:44 <rego>	or it won't build (at least for me)
Dec 02 06:36:48 <rego>	if I remember properly
Dec 02 06:37:10 <rego>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163591#c6
Dec 02 06:37:17 <rego>	"This is the version using the upstream patch to fix the build with CUPS. However it doesn't work if glib is not in version 2.50. So I've provided a different patch in bug #163689 to bump the glib version that should be landed before this one."
Dec 02 06:38:14 <kov>	ah, that is probably due to needing some .am file from glib when running autogen
Dec 02 06:38:20 <kov>	ok, makes sense
Dec 02 06:44:42 <rego>	kov: I don't remember the details but it was related to something like that yeah
Dec 02 06:45:17 <kov>	err .m4
Dec 02 07:06:55 <aleray>	kov, rego, thanks for looking into it. Just to know... are you fixing the bug now? :)
Dec 02 07:07:32 <rego>	aleray: not me, I'm leaving in a while for some holidays :-)
Dec 02 07:08:55 <kov>	aleray, I'll see if I can fix it, but it will take a while
Dec 02 07:09:19 <kov>	i need to fix it to build webkit on my system now, so…
Dec 02 07:10:11 <aleray>	kov, have a good time then!
Dec 02 07:10:16 <aleray>	oups
Dec 02 07:10:29 <aleray>	rego I meant (for the holidays)
Dec 02 07:11:47 <aleray>	kov nice if you can share your fix. I want to test cutting-edge version of webkit on linux, and I guess gtk is the only linux port.Or am I wrong?
Dec 02 07:12:00 <aleray>	the only official linux port I meant
Dec 02 07:12:19 <annulen>	efl is the other one
Dec 02 07:12:38 <aleray>	ah, good. I will try
Dec 02 07:13:00 <kov>	rego, \o/ holidays
Dec 02 07:13:17 <kov>	aleray, I will make sure it lands if I can come up with a fix
Dec 02 07:13:27 <rego>	:D just a few days but it's clear I'm not working on this these days
Dec 02 11:19:02 <blino>	mcatanzaro: hi, on https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=771438#c3 you mentionned that you disabled libmount support in glib, but it looks like the option can not be disabled, we still get a fatal error message with explicit --disable-libmount
Dec 02 11:28:29 <mcatanzaro>	(Seriously...?)
Dec 02 11:29:35 <mcatanzaro>	blino: I do not have libmount installed but it's working fine for me
Dec 02 11:29:52 <blino>	that's weird, maybe depends on the autotools version?
Dec 02 11:30:03 <blino>	configure.ac is using AC_MSG_ERROR if not found
Dec 02 11:30:16 <mcatanzaro>	I can't imagine it depends on autotools version
Dec 02 11:30:32 <mcatanzaro>	blino: You're having trouble with GNOME JHbuild?
Dec 02 11:30:59 <mcatanzaro>	Is it possible that you're overriding the autogenargs for the GLib module? Check your jhbuildrc.
Dec 02 11:31:00 <blino>	mcatanzaro: nope, standalone build of glib for embedded system
Dec 02 11:31:48 <mcatanzaro>	It even uses AM_CONDITIONAL so it's clearly set up for it to be optional
Dec 02 11:32:14 <blino>	but later on: https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/configure.ac#n1758
Dec 02 11:33:04 <mcatanzaro>	blino: That code should only run if you don't pass --enable-libmount or --disable-libmount, could you have a typo?
Dec 02 11:33:22 <mcatanzaro>	Wait I'm misreading it
Dec 02 11:33:58 <mcatanzaro>	It only runs if you pass --enable-libmount...?
Dec 02 11:34:41 <mcatanzaro>	No I'm still misreading it
Dec 02 11:35:37 <mcatanzaro>	It errors out on Linux, but not other platforms, unless you pass --disable-libmount. (And there's a warning that the --disable-libmount code is buggy/broken, but I don't care for the purposes of JHBuild because JHBuild is only for testing and not production; maybe you care.)
Dec 02 11:36:08 <mcatanzaro>	blino: You're going to have to debug config.log to figure out what's going wrong, I think
Dec 02 11:36:24 <annulen>	LinuxIsNotAboutChoice.jpg
Dec 02 11:36:30 <blino>	mcatanzaro: hmm, maybe you'right, my build is actually running two builds in parallel, one for the host system, one for the cross-compiling target, it looks like one of them did not get the option
Dec 02 11:36:38 <blino>	mcatanzaro: thanks for your help, and sorry for the noise
Dec 02 11:36:41 <mcatanzaro>	:)

Dec 13 06:53:39 <aperezdc>	kov: let me see if I can poke the people in charge of them
Dec 13 06:53:54 <kov>	aperezdc, thanks =)
Dec 13 06:54:59 <kov>	aperezdc, the errors make me think it might be just the vm is out of disk space
Dec 13 06:55:12 <aperezdc>	it's plausible
Dec 13 06:55:16 <kov>	s/vm/system/ not sure it's a vm heh
Dec 13 06:56:23 <aperezdc>	IIRC they're LXC containers, with their own file system, and it's easier to make it grow than the other way around (can be done online with LVM), so I think sometimes they space is allocated on the short side, because it's easy to grow them
Dec 13 06:57:28 <aperezdc>	I think it's better that clopez pokes the EWSs, he's been working with the machines more closely, if he doesn't in a while, I can try myself
Dec 13 07:01:13 <kov>	aperezdc, cool, thanks; is he not on vacations?
Dec 13 07:04:46 <aperezdc>	kov: mmh, apparentlynot today... and I see him only in our internal chat, so let's see

Dec 13 10:17:32 <kov>	aperezdc, seems to still be borked /o
Dec 13 10:17:56 <kov>	aperezdc, https://webkit-queues.webkit.org/results/2713292
Dec 13 10:18:11 <kov>	aperezdc, looks like the git repository is broken or there is a problem creating files?
Dec 13 10:28:36 <tevaum>	kov: disk full? Inodes 100% used?
Dec 13 10:28:48 <kov>	tevaum, that's my theory
Dec 13 10:29:05 <kov>	=> aperezdc, the errors make me think it might be just the vm is out of disk space
Dec 13 10:29:06 <kov>	heh
Dec 13 10:42:02 <Ossy>	kov, not only the EWS is broken, but the trunk GTK build too since https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/209744
Dec 13 10:43:35 <mcatanzaro>	Ossy: Looks like last successful build was r209727, so I guess it's been broken longer than that
Dec 13 11:22:55 <keis>	hi o/
Dec 13 11:23:12 <keis>	I'm looking for a way to keep cookies in sync between processes
Dec 13 11:23:52 <keis>	in the wk1 this was possible by hooking into the soup session but with wk2 this is not exposed anymore
Dec 13 11:24:15 <mcatanzaro>	keis: That should be done automatically, it's definitely a bug if not
Dec 13 11:24:59 <mcatanzaro>	keis: It works fine in Epiphany....
Dec 13 11:25:09 <keis>	mcatanzaro: what is the isolation based on? because I guess it's not supposed to be all programs on the system?
Dec 13 11:26:27 <mcatanzaro>	keis: OK it's not quite automatic, you do need to create a WebKitCookieManager and call webkit_cookie_manager_set_persistent_storage(), that takes a filename for either a text file or an SQLite file
Dec 13 11:27:51 <keis>	from the documentation it looks like the file is only used to get the initial cookies
Dec 13 11:27:56 <keis>	and then appended to
Dec 13 11:28:38 <kov>	Ossy, awesome
Dec 13 11:29:03 <kov>	the EWS being broken ends up helping keep that situation going though heh
Dec 13 11:29:04 <keis>	but not reloaded by A when B writes
Dec 13 11:29:10 <mcatanzaro>	keis: Hm, look into what Epiphany does then; I doubt it's doing anything special but it works fine there
Dec 13 11:29:15 <kov>	mcatanzaro, o/ can you take a look at the EWS or ping someone who can?
Dec 13 11:29:19 <mcatanzaro>	At least I stay logged in to my online accounts when opening new tabs....
Dec 13 11:29:36 <keis>	that's still the same process, no?
Dec 13 11:29:37 <mcatanzaro>	kov: I'll ping folks but it's late in Europe so might be offline until tomorrow
Dec 13 11:29:52 <kov>	mcatanzaro, thanks! it's been offline since friday I'm told
Dec 13 11:29:52 <mcatanzaro>	keis: Of course not, it's one process per tab
Dec 13 11:30:01 <kov>	well, s/offline/broken/
Dec 13 11:30:13 <mcatanzaro>	keis: Are you trying to sync cookies between multiple *UI processes* running at the same time?
Dec 13 11:30:46 <keis>	no, not web processes. I get that each view runs it's own process
Dec 13 11:31:03 <keis>	I'm talking about "top-level" user processes
Dec 13 11:31:07 <mcatanzaro>	That really ought to work too... but I doubt it's ever tested. Yes, Ephy only ever has a single UI process.
Dec 13 11:32:09 <keis>	yeah. well, I guess I'll give a try the easiest way to find out
Dec 13 11:32:09 <mcatanzaro>	How does SQLite handle having the same database opened by multiple applications, I wonder?
Dec 13 11:32:38 <mcatanzaro>	(You might have better luck with SQLite than a text database.)
Dec 13 11:33:16 <keis>	typically you would put locks around sqlites so I don't think the chances are too good :/
Dec 13 11:33:36 <keis>	but that's based on years old info :P
Dec 13 11:38:43 <ManDay>	Any idea why in Minibrowser I can't open the "buglist.cgi" and Minibrowser downloads it instead?
Dec 13 11:44:47 <annulen>	ManDay: what is content-type in response?
Dec 13 11:46:08 <mcatanzaro>	FWIW ephy displays https://bugs.webkit.org/buglist.cgi
Dec 13 11:49:59 <keis>	ok. so with both sqlite and text it works for instances started after setting the cookie
Dec 13 11:50:26 <keis>	but other instances is not reloading the information
Dec 13 11:50:51 <mcatanzaro>	I'd file a bug report
Dec 13 11:52:05 <keis>	sure
Dec 13 11:52:56 <keis>	but you think this is something that should be supported, I realise it's a fringe usecase
Dec 13 11:53:24 <mcatanzaro>	I wouldn't expect somebody to fix it, but it seems like it *ought* to work ;)
Dec 13 11:54:21 <keis>	heh. fair enough
Dec 13 11:54:51 <keis>	I wouldn't mind digging into some code myself. but it sounds like this could be fairly complex
Dec 13 12:09:49 <keis>	is network access happening in the web process?
Dec 13 12:10:02 <annulen>	no, in NetworkProcess
Dec 13 12:10:12 <mcatanzaro>	keis: Sometimes, unfortunately. For web sockets, and maybe sometimes for XHR
Dec 13 12:10:29 <mcatanzaro>	There's even some in the UI process if you use Ephy (for Firefox sync)
Dec 13 12:10:35 <keis>	aha, and that's distinct from both the ui and the web?
Dec 13 12:11:02 <annulen>	yep
Dec 13 12:11:04 <mcatanzaro>	keis: Ideally all the network access would happen in the network process so we can sandbox the web process better, but we're not there yet
Dec 13 12:11:18 <mcatanzaro>	Web process really shouldn't have network access!
Dec 13 12:11:51 <keis>	ok. cool. that's really encouraging
Dec 13 12:12:14 <keis>	is it one network process per web?
Dec 13 12:12:23 <mcatanzaro>	keis: No, just one total
Dec 13 12:13:40 <keis>	I see, so in *theory* the web processes of two different gui processes could be using the same network process?
Dec 13 12:13:55 <annulen>	no
Dec 13 12:13:56 <mcatanzaro>	keis: No no, one network process per UI process :p
Dec 13 12:14:41 <annulen>	though it might be feasible to implement such scheme
Dec 13 12:15:19 <keis>	thinking out loud.. but that might be easier than trying to keep N processes in sync
Dec 13 12:45:39 <annulen>	keis: if both are equally trusted it makes sense. As a bonus to shared cookies they will also share caches
Dec 13 13:25:35 <ManDay>	annulen: can't tell right now, sorry. it's on gentoo's bugzilla if you want to check. g2g thanks tho
Dec 13 13:26:05 <keis>	right. what I'm thinking here is different components of what's conceptually the same application
Dec 13 13:26:10 <keis>	so sharing all of that would make sense
Dec 13 13:43:38 <annulen>	keis: if this is the same application, why do you need 2 ui processes?
Dec 13 14:33:35 <keis>	it's separate windows and launched independently
Dec 13 14:35:09 <keis>	keeping different process makes a few things easier to deal with like environment variables or processing from stdin
Dec 13 14:47:41 <annulen>	well, neither of those things seems to me as valid reason to split gui application into 2 applications, though maybe there are others
Dec 13 14:48:45 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: It's actually slightly tricker to use one GUI process for multiple windows. In GNOME we use GtkApplication which mostly fixes that, but still odd bugs that can happen if you're not careful. Older apps are normally one process per window.
Dec 13 14:52:12 <annulen>	whoa, in Qt land things are way different :)
Dec 13 14:55:11 <keis>	this is in the context of classic style program where running the binary gives you one "thing"
Dec 13 14:55:44 <keis>	which ofcourse means it's abusing process global state because hey why not
Dec 13 15:04:36 <keis>	having processes means being able to identify this "vim" from that other "vim"
Dec 13 15:04:41 <keis>	which is a feature I think
Dec 14 03:06:53 <ManDay>	Is there any known problem with 2.14.2 and 2.15.2 with threading or something? Almost every second link I click on a webpage with javascript "hangs" and doesn't load
Dec 14 03:13:59 <ManDay>	(mostly youtube and ebay)
Dec 14 05:17:58 <ManDay>	Even with javascript disabled this happens. For example on amazon.de. The page just does not load, the "progress" bar in MiniBrowser is stuck
Dec 14 05:18:36 <ManDay>	i already recompiled with minimal options
Dec 14 05:20:22 <ManDay>	well... it seems there is something wrong with all those pages (presumably my isp then)
Dec 14 05:20:38 <ManDay>	at least elinks also has problems loading it. sorry for blaming it on wk
Dec 15 07:38:12 <msanchez>	morning all (it's been a while!)
Dec 15 07:39:03 <msanchez>	anyone knows when webkit2gtk+ 2.14.3 will be released, by any chance?
Dec 15 07:39:29 <msanchez>	I'm not seeing KaL here, so I'm assuming not until the beginning of the next year :-), just double checking
Dec 15 08:29:03 <aperezdc>	msanchez: KaL is on holiday right now, I think
Dec 15 08:29:33 <aperezdc>	IIRC he should be back in a couple of weeks, tops... someone else might have an idea if there's a release coming before he's back
Dec 15 08:29:55 <aperezdc>	mcatanzaro, who's offline at the moment, would be the person to ask
Dec 15 09:08:05 <msanchez>	aperezdc: thanks
Dec 15 09:08:37 <msanchez>	I'll check with Michael then, but in principle will assume January will be the time :)
Dec 16 12:22:57 <keis>	looked a bit at how the network process is managed and that's all very entrenched in the platform
Dec 16 12:23:09 <keis>	not sure it's a good idea to change all that and for sure not something I'm ready to tackle
Dec 16 12:24:37 <keis>	does something like a networked cookie backend for soup sound like a reasonable thing?
Dec 16 12:50:43 <mcatanzaro>	keis: I don't think so, there are lots of other types of state that should be shared in the same way, right? localstorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL....
Dec 16 12:51:02 <mcatanzaro>	It's a bit unfortunate that our API for cookie storage is different than for these other technologies.
Dec 17 13:27:40 <keis>	I'm not sure they must but it sure would be nice if that also worked
Dec 19 08:19:09 <Kekun>	hi, I took some time to look how video rendering is handled by WKGTK+, if I understand correctly: some pixmaps are rendered by the web process and are sent to the UI process via sone IPC mechanism which can then display them
Dec 19 08:19:17 <Kekun>	am I right? is it how it works with hardware acceleration too?
Dec 19 08:19:38 <mcatanzaro>	Maybe eocanha or magomez knows?
Dec 19 08:24:41 <kov>	Kekun, in accelerated compositing mode we use different strategies for X and Wayland atm
Dec 19 08:24:53 <magomez>	yep
Dec 19 08:25:31 <kov>	for X, the compositing results are shared using the X composite extension, similar to how the X window managers work
Dec 19 08:26:03 <magomez>	with X, a X window handler is sent from the ui process to the web process, and the contents are rendered to a glx context created for that window
Dec 19 08:27:03 <kov>	and for wayland we have an internal sub-compositor; the web processes connect to the ui process as clients, the ui process' compositor's surface is then converted to a GL texture which is used as a source for painting to the gtk widget
Dec 19 08:28:26 <Kekun>	ok thanks
Dec 19 08:29:26 <Kekun>	I'm going more or less the same route as WebKit for RetroGtk: running into a subprocess and rendering into a GtkWidget
Dec 19 08:29:55 <Kekun>	so any info is good to take :)

Dec 22 15:21:05 <pc100>	</body>
Dec 22 15:21:39 <mcatanzaro>	pc100: I think WebKit might restrict HTTP to port 80, you could ask in #webkit
Dec 22 15:22:04 <pc100>	when queried for password ... randomly one or the other authentication happens
Dec 22 15:24:09 <mcatanzaro>	Oh
Dec 22 15:24:44 <mcatanzaro>	pc100: Could you file a bug on bugs.webkit.org? Select the WebKitGTK+ component so that we see the bug report. It might not be a cross-platform issue.
Dec 22 15:31:45 <pc100>	I plan to file one later today
Dec 22 15:32:29 <pc100>	is there a way to limit cache size in webkit?
Dec 22 15:33:01 <mcatanzaro>	pc100: Yeah, the disk cache is limited to something fairly small, 128 MiB I think
Dec 22 15:33:27 <mcatanzaro>	Oh, no, it's not configurable, but it's small enough you wouldn't want to configure it
Dec 22 15:34:01 <pc100>	is this obsolete? undefined reference to `webkit_application_cache_set_maximum_size'
Dec 22 15:34:15 <mcatanzaro>	pc100: I don't know what application cache is, that's completely different
Dec 22 15:34:27 <mcatanzaro>	I think it's for offline web apps, it's not what you want
Dec 22 15:34:39 <mcatanzaro>	http://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html5_app_cache.asp
Dec 22 15:36:23 <mcatanzaro>	pc100: Hm, seems to be a cache leak :(
Dec 22 15:36:28 <mcatanzaro>	My cache directory is way too large
Dec 22 15:36:43 <pc100>	I am hoping you are saying the total amount is 128MB limit all streaming videos to that ...
Dec 22 15:37:33 <mcatanzaro>	pc100: GStreamer doesn't use the WebKit cache, I think that cache just grows forever as it doesn't have a way to keep track of the files at all, and nobody seems to care to fix it.
Dec 22 15:38:37 <pc100>	i'm running ubuntu 16.10  .. what is name of directory or file for webkit cache?
Dec 22 15:39:36 <mcatanzaro>	pc100: Applications can decide the directory. For Epiphany it is ~/.cache/epiphany/WebKitCache
Dec 22 15:41:51 <mcatanzaro>	pc100: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166428
Dec 22 15:42:31 <mcatanzaro>	pc100: Looks like the default cache directory is ~/.cache/[program name]/WebKitCache
Dec 22 15:44:12 <pc100>	thanks for the info mcantanzaro ... stepping away for awhile
Dec 22 15:48:45 <mcatanzaro>	pc100: also: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119477

Jan 04 04:58:32 <jmleo>	Hi there ! I am using midori and epihphany with a touchscreen, and when I am fullscreen, any dropdown-menu displayed is difficult to select. When I am using firefox, with the same display and all, it works well, so I think it can be webkitgtk+ related
Jan 04 04:58:59 <jmleo>	Do you have any idea of a debug option I could use or something explaining this behaviour ?
Jan 04 10:17:40 <lufimtse>	Hello, the WebKitUserContentManager allows Javascript to call Gtk's script-message-received handler. Is there any way for Gtk to return a value back to Javascript upon completion? (ex success/fail/some value?)
Jan 04 10:32:21 <aperezdc>	lufimtse: sorry, but that's not possible, as script-message-received is async
Jan 04 10:33:11 <aperezdc>	lufimtse: you can use
Jan 04 10:33:12 <aperezdc>	void	webkit_web_view_run_javascript from your GTK+ application to ACK that the message was received
Jan 04 11:03:07 <lufimtse>	aperezdc, thank you.
Jan 04 11:48:30 <mcrha>	hi mcatanzaro, is it possible to disable bmalloc thread creation on a library load in runtime? I get a lockup in libasan when trying to load a module: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/519920/
Jan 04 11:50:00 <mcatanzaro>	mcrha: Run with Malloc=1. Yes, it's a lowercase environment variable, I guess that's usual on Mac
Jan 04 11:50:06 <mcatanzaro>	That will disable bmalloc
Jan 04 11:50:21 <mcrha>	mcatanzaro, nice, thanks
Jan 04 11:50:25 <mcatanzaro>	https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/EnvironmentVariables
Jan 04 11:55:58 <mcrha>	set | grep Ma
Jan 04 11:55:58 <mcrha>	Malloc=1
Jan 04 11:56:24 <mcrha>	and the bmalloc is still called during the dlopen(). Weird.
Jan 04 11:56:36 <mcatanzaro>	:(
Jan 04 11:56:45 <mcatanzaro>	Maybe the wiki page is wrong?
Jan 04 11:56:45 <mcrha>	export Variable="1"
Jan 04 11:56:50 <mcrha>	oops
Jan 04 11:56:56 <mcrha>	trying again
Jan 04 11:57:42 <mcatanzaro>	Surely the wiki page must be wrong there...? It would be silly for it to expect a string....
Jan 04 11:58:18 <mcrha>	either that, or the g_module_open() doesn't pass this one "upwords"
Jan 04 11:58:26 <mcrha>	"upwards"
Jan 04 12:05:16 <mcrha>	mcatanzaro, I see that (and many other) variables in isMallocEnvironmentVariableSet(), but it doesn't trigger for some reason, neither the one in isLibgmallocEnabled()
Jan 04 12:05:41 <mcatanzaro>	Needs debugging then :(
Jan 04 12:06:05 <mcatanzaro>	Might be easier to just rebuild with -DUSE_SYSTEM_MALLOC=ON if you don't need a runtime option and don't want to debug
Jan 04 12:08:08 <mcrha>	mcatanzaro, it seems to me that it creates the bmalloc thread anyway, only calls pure malloc() inside it
Jan 04 12:08:50 <mcrha>	yup, I'd build with the system malloc instead
Jan 05 08:07:56 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos can you please add http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/210276 in 2.14.3?
Jan 05 08:09:49 <KaL>	tpopela: done
Jan 05 08:10:19 <tpopela>	KaL, thank you! I will send two CLoop related in a minute (once I again find them)
Jan 05 08:11:07 <tpopela>	KaL, http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/210136
Jan 05 08:11:56 <tpopela>	http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/210138
Jan 05 08:12:02 <tpopela>	and http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/210139
Jan 05 08:13:30 <KaL>	ok, added too, I hope they apply clenaly
Jan 05 08:13:36 <KaL>	cleanly
Jan 05 08:16:26 <tpopela>	KaL, let me check that..
Jan 05 08:27:55 <tpopela>	KaL, let's skip the last three patches as they depend on http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/205569 and that one it quite big.. I will look at it for 2.14.4 if I will really need them..

Jan 06 12:14:37 <lufimtse>	aperezdc, Hey ya. Do you know, is there any 'sync' way for Javascript to call C? (in webkitgtk)
Jan 06 12:15:17 <mcatanzaro>	I did that once
Jan 06 12:15:21 *	mcatanzaro looks for code
Jan 06 12:15:25 <mcatanzaro>	It's not simple
Jan 06 12:15:38 <lufimtse>	Interesting

Jan 06 12:17:00 <lufimtse>	Interesting
Jan 06 12:17:05 <lufimtse>	thank you for sharing. Will investigate.
Jan 06 12:46:32 <tomturbo_>	hey folks!
Jan 06 13:33:24 <aperezdc>	lufimtse: yes, I think there is: you can expose your code as JS functions/objects using the JavaScriptCore API
Jan 06 13:33:25 <aperezdc>	lufimtse: you would do that using a WebKitWebExtension which gets loaded by the web process
Jan 06 13:33:43 <lufimtse>	I see
Jan 06 13:33:47 <lufimtse>	thank you for suggestion.

Jan 18 05:10:42 <veera>	Hi all.
Jan 18 05:10:47 <veera>	One query.
Jan 18 05:11:19 <veera>	Is there any port or development of webkitgtk started for gtk-4
Jan 18 05:29:41 <KaL>	veera: nop
Jan 18 05:45:06 <veera>	@Kal: Thanks for info
Jan 18 05:45:27 <veera>	Perhaps it is too early to expect.
Jan 18 11:14:33 <duncanyoyo1>	Hello everyone
Jan 18 11:15:42 <duncanyoyo1>	I updated webkit2gtk to 2.14.3-1 and it seems to have broken my lightdm-webkit2-greeter. I rolled back to 2.14.2-2 and its working fine again.
Jan 18 11:16:15 <duncanyoyo1>	The greeter probably needs an update
Jan 18 11:16:23 <duncanyoyo1>	Not that you guys have anything to do with it
Jan 18 11:16:55 <mcatanzaro>	That greeter is just a really bad idea :(
Jan 18 11:17:06 <mcatanzaro>	Let's look at the changeset
Jan 18 11:17:12 <KaL>	duncanyoyo1: what's exactly broken?
Jan 18 11:17:25 <mcatanzaro>	Probably localstorage again
Jan 18 11:17:48 <KaL>	csp changes?
Jan 18 11:18:06 <mcatanzaro>	Doubt it, those made it more permissive I think
Jan 18 11:19:57 <mcatanzaro>	duncanyoyo1: Time for a game of "spot the problem": https://trac.webkit.org/log/releases/WebKitGTK/webkit-2.14
Jan 18 11:21:25 <mcatanzaro>	Hm, none of the changes look suspicious to me. KaL I was wrong to assume we merged the local storage related patches
Jan 18 11:21:54 <KaL>	without knowing what's broken it's impossible to figure out
Jan 18 11:22:07 <mcatanzaro>	Yeah, I guess the greeter developers will motivated to figure it out :P
Jan 18 11:23:20 <mcatanzaro>	They really need to be testing trunk regularly to avoid surprises like this... they know from experience our security updates can break them
Jan 18 16:41:36 <bfulgham>	mcatanzaro: ping?
Jan 18 16:43:30 <mcatanzaro>	Hey bfulgham
Jan 18 16:43:36 <mcatanzaro>	I really don't know what to do with that bug :(
Jan 18 16:44:32 <mcatanzaro>	bfulgham: Your restriction makes sense when we think of files opened manually in a web browser, but seems to conflict with WebKit2 loadHTML APIs
Jan 18 16:45:24 <mcatanzaro>	Or maybe it's API misuse even... I just don't know!
Jan 18 16:47:40 <mcatanzaro>	bfulgham: One should not disappear after sending a ping :)
Jan 18 16:47:57 <bfulgham>	sorry!
Jan 18 16:48:00 <bfulgham>	Back now
Jan 18 16:48:46 <bfulgham>	mcatanzaro: So, your existing patch is definitely a step in the right direction.
Jan 18 16:49:29 <bfulgham>	mcatanzaro: The SecurityOrigin::isLocal check was wrong, because things added to the "localURLSchemes" set suddenly fell under this new logic, which was not my intention.
Jan 18 16:49:45 <bfulgham>	mcatanzaro: So checking for protocol == file is correct.
Jan 18 16:49:51 <mcatanzaro>	Yes
Jan 18 16:49:55 <mcatanzaro>	That we agree
Jan 18 16:49:57 <bfulgham>	I'm not sure I understand the second case you have.
Jan 18 16:50:04 <mcatanzaro>	Me either :D
Jan 18 16:50:09 <bfulgham>	Do you have cases where you use "file:///abc", where "abc" is not expected to exist?
Jan 18 16:50:29 <mcatanzaro>	Yes. In several of our tests, at least. Let's look at specific ones...
Jan 18 16:52:09 <mcatanzaro>	It looks like broken tests are /webkit2/WebKitSecurityManager/file-xhr, /webkit2/WebKitConsoleMessage/network-error, and /webkit2/WebKitWebPage/context-menu
Jan 18 16:52:20 <mcatanzaro>	Let's look those up...
Jan 18 16:54:08 <mcatanzaro>	Actually that context menu test is passing... which one is failing...? it's not clear from the logs...
Jan 18 16:54:22 <mcatanzaro>	Ah, it's /webkit2/WebKitWebView/default-menu
Jan 18 16:54:33 <bfulgham>	kk
Jan 18 16:55:04 <mcatanzaro>	And maybe the answer is to change the tests, I'm not sure. Let's start with context menu I guess
Jan 18 16:55:23 <mcatanzaro>	Tools/TestWebKitAPI/Tests/WebKit2Gtk/TestContextMenu.cpp
Jan 18 16:56:09 <mcatanzaro>	The test fails because we right-click on a media element expecting media entries in the context menu, but they're not there because the media did not load
Jan 18 16:56:29 <mcatanzaro>	        " <video style='position:absolute; left:1; top:50' width='300' height='300' controls='controls' preload='none'><source src='movie.ogg' type='video/ogg' /></video>"
Jan 18 16:56:32 <mcatanzaro>	        " <audio style='position:absolute; left:1; top:60' width='50' height='20' controls='controls' preload='none'><source src='track.ogg' type='audio/ogg' /></audio>"
Jan 18 16:57:11 <mcatanzaro>	bfulgham: It uses test->loadHtml(linksHTML, "file:///");
Jan 18 16:57:13 <bfulgham>	Do you get a load error?
Jan 18 16:57:39 <bfulgham>	... and linksHTML contains "movie.ogg", etc.?
Jan 18 16:57:40 <mcatanzaro>	I haven't added printfs in the code to see what's happening, but surely it's because the files are not being loaded
Jan 18 16:57:51 <mcatanzaro>	No, those files don't exist anywhere
Jan 18 16:57:55 <mcatanzaro>	But file:/// does exist
Jan 18 16:58:15 <bfulgham>	OH! I see. This is the case of non-existing file being compared to existing file.
Jan 18 16:58:23 <mcatanzaro>	Yeah. So by virtual of /movie.ogg and /track.ogg not existing, they're considered different volumes and the load fails.
Jan 18 16:58:43 <mcatanzaro>	This seems like not a realistic case though. Real code wouldn't try to use a nonexistent file here and wouldn't care how it fails.
Jan 18 16:58:52 <bfulgham>	So previously the load did not fail, even though the files did not exist?
Jan 18 16:58:56 <mcatanzaro>	We could always just add files to make the test work, I suppose.
Jan 18 16:59:03 <bfulgham>	Maybe we put the media elements in a pending state of some kind.
Jan 18 16:59:23 <mcatanzaro>	bfulgham: I guess the load must have failed, because they don't exist, but the context menu entries were created anyway? I am not sure actually!
Jan 18 16:59:53 <bfulgham>	We could relax that requirement, maybe change the test from boolean to an Optional<bool>. If one or the other file doesn't exist, we do not check Volume at all and act like a no-op?
Jan 18 17:00:09 <mcatanzaro>	Anyway since the base URI is file:/// those files are expected to be toplevel in / so they definitely don't exist ;)
Jan 18 17:00:24 <mcatanzaro>	bfulgham: That was my first thought, but it's harder than that
Jan 18 17:00:37 <bfulgham>	So: Optional<bool> returns TRUE if both files exist and have the same Volume. FALSE if both files exist and have different volumes, and nullopt if one of the files doesn't exist?
Jan 18 17:01:09 <mcatanzaro>	Imagine: user loads file:///malicous.html, which wants to access a resource on another volume. All malicious.html has to do to gain access is delete itself using filesystem API or something.
Jan 18 17:01:52 <mcatanzaro>	So we want to avoid THAT pitfall....
Jan 18 17:01:58 <bfulgham>	I think the SecurityOrigin is set at load time, but there might be a way to reset it while still leaving the code in-memory.
Jan 18 17:02:31 <mcatanzaro>	Doesn't matter, the filesHaveSameVolume check looks for the files on disk
Jan 18 17:03:40 <mcatanzaro>	So if the file starts with some JS that deletes itself, then has some naughty JS to try loading files in another partition, that would succeed... presuming the browser doesn't reload the file immediately when it's deleted (which is what Ephy does) but I imagine we probably don't want to deal with that race condition either
Jan 18 17:03:47 <heftig>	does anyone have any blog posts or similar from webkitgtk devs urging people to drop 2.4?
Jan 18 17:04:03 <mcatanzaro>	heftig: https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/01/on-webkit-security-updates/
Jan 18 17:04:15 <heftig>	thanks
Jan 18 17:04:53 <mcatanzaro>	If that's not enough: point the holdouts at https://webkitgtk.org/security.html
Jan 18 17:04:58 <mcatanzaro>	Thanks btw ;)
Jan 18 17:05:05 <bfulgham>	mcatanzaro: We could treat m_filePath in SecurityOrigin specially. I.e., if m_filePath doesn't exist, we refuse to load as that indicates a self-deleting case.
Jan 18 17:05:22 <bfulgham>	mcatanzaro: If other.m_filePath doesn't exist, we treat that as "okay".
Jan 18 17:06:26 <heftig>	mcatanzaro: I think 2.4.10 was sort of a mercy release?
Jan 18 17:06:28 <mcatanzaro>	bfulgham: OK, that's a good point: if the other file doesn't exist, it must be OK.
Jan 18 17:07:12 <mcatanzaro>	heftig: Yes, that only fixed ~half the vulnerabilities we knew about that were easy to backport. It was for GTK+ 3.20 compatibility, you couldn't see any mails in evolution without it.
Jan 18 17:07:29 <mcatanzaro>	(heftig: And that was a year ago)
Jan 18 17:08:05 <mcatanzaro>	heftig: FWIW the plan is to remove it from Fedora rawhide in March
Jan 18 17:09:06 <mcatanzaro>	OK bfulgham, so next problem
Jan 18 17:09:14 <mcatanzaro>	This test uses file:/// as the base URI
Jan 18 17:09:19 <mcatanzaro>	Ah, actually no problem
Jan 18 17:09:21 <mcatanzaro>	OK
Jan 18 17:09:40 <bfulgham>	Oh, good!  I like no problem. :-)
Jan 18 17:10:00 <mcatanzaro>	So I think that would fix this test at least. If the file trying to load another doesn't exist, it's fatal error. If the other file doesn't exist, no worries.
Jan 18 17:10:23 <mcatanzaro>	(BTW: Mozilla is even stricter, they only allow files to access other files in the same *directory*)
Jan 18 17:11:20 <bfulgham>	I propose we change the signature of "fileHaveSameVolume" to use "source" for "fileA" and "target" for "fileB", then return false if "source" does not have a device Id, and "true" if "target" does not have a device ID.
Jan 18 17:11:34 <bfulgham>	mcatanzaro: Wow! That's probably even better, but might break even more stuff.
Jan 18 17:11:47 <bfulgham>	mcatanzaro: But might be good to file a bug to tighten up the file protections further!
Jan 18 17:12:32 <mcatanzaro>	bfulgham: I'm trying to think of some problem with  your proposal, don't have one yet ;)
Jan 18 17:12:45 <mcatanzaro>	So might be good
Jan 18 17:13:55 <mcatanzaro>	OTOH, bfulgham, maybe we should just change our tests to not load non-existent files. Not sure.
Jan 18 17:16:15 <bfulgham>	mcatanzaro: I would like to propose landing changes based on what we discussed, and consider tightening further if you don't need to use non-existent files in your tests.
Jan 18 17:16:53 <mcatanzaro>	bfulgham: I think we do not need to use them. They just don't exist because the contents of the files are not relevant to the test.
Jan 18 17:16:56 <bfulgham>	mcatanzaro: I want to include this change in some developer seeds, and your experience makes me worried that external WebKit Framework users might be doing similar things with non-existing files, etc., and I don't want to create compatibility issues.
Jan 18 17:17:15 <bfulgham>	mcatanzaro: Oh, okay. Then I guess your patch is good as-is?
Jan 18 17:17:23 <mcatanzaro>	I think my patch is good as-is, yse
Jan 18 17:17:26 <mcatanzaro>	*yes
Jan 18 17:17:31 <mcatanzaro>	We should use my patch regardless
Jan 18 17:17:57 <bfulgham>	ok. Can I encourage you to land it (cq+) it, so I can try to get it into a build we're doing tonight? :-)
Jan 18 17:18:00 <mcatanzaro>	OK
Jan 18 17:18:04 <bfulgham>	Thank you!
Jan 18 17:18:34 <bfulgham>	And... if you want to explore Firefox-ing the file test, I'm open to that as well. I'm sure Apple's product security team would be fully behind that! :-)
Jan 18 17:18:56 <mcatanzaro>	I don't :P
Jan 18 17:19:09 <bfulgham>	:-)
Jan 18 17:19:12 <bfulgham>	Fair enough.
Jan 18 17:20:55 <mcatanzaro>	bfulgham: Look at testWebContextSecurityFileXHR in TestWebKitWebContext.cpp. Looks like that test uses a nonexistent source file.
Jan 18 17:21:03 <mcatanzaro>	Again, maybe that's crazy and we should change that.
Jan 18 17:21:39 <mcatanzaro>	That test actually goes to pains to specify resource directory, but the file simple.html just does not exist
Jan 18 17:22:00 <bfulgham>	Interesting. I guess that avoids having to create the files during the test?
Jan 18 17:22:12 <mcatanzaro>	It might be an accident, I don't know
Jan 18 17:22:54 <mcatanzaro>	Maybe it wanted "boring.html". Anyway the contents of the file are not relevant, it's testing JS injected with runJavascript()
Jan 18 17:23:04 <mcatanzaro>	Apparently that works even if the file doesn't exist
Jan 18 17:25:23 <bfulgham>	ok
Jan 19 05:06:09 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos if you will have some time, any feedback on https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151998 will be appreciated..
Jan 19 05:06:57 <KaL>	tpopela: right now, I don't want you to work more again because I review this late
Jan 19 05:07:35 <tpopela>	KaL, Carlos no problem at all :)..

Jan 20 10:37:03 <heftig>	i'm kinda stuck to quassel because it's bouncer-like and has an android UI
Jan 20 10:37:37 <heftig>	i'd love to use riot (matrix) instead but the bridging is not so good
Jan 20 10:40:21 <mcatanzaro>	heftig: riot is actually what I'm planning to use when Empathy is gone... I tried the bridging a while back and it was working fine for me.  And I'll need Matrix for work anyway.
Jan 20 10:40:44 <mcatanzaro>	Actually it was a lot nicer than Empathy; I still use Empathy because I need XMPP for now, that's all
Jan 20 10:40:51 <heftig>	mcatanzaro: i need identification to work right...
Jan 20 10:41:24 <mcatanzaro>	identification doesn't work in empathy anyway (if by that you mean NickServ) so shrug! Also it's under active development, we're seeing bugs get fixed quickly, so that's optimistic.
Jan 20 10:42:17 <heftig>	yeah, i do; although SASL is preferred where available

Jan 23 12:04:28 <clopez>	kov: go ahead please.. but take into acount i'm not reviewer ...
Jan 23 12:04:32 <clopez>	:)
Jan 23 12:10:26 <kov>	clopez, yeah, I'll get it reviewed, wondered if you wanted to make the patch =)
Jan 23 12:10:47 <clopez>	kov: oh no, thanks hehe.... is all yours ;)
Jan 23 12:10:55 <kov>	I'm replacing the assert with a check for an early return
Jan 24 08:02:53 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos, can you please look again on https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151998 ? I added documentation there and added a unit test as well..
Jan 24 09:10:22 <KaL>	tpopela: looking
Jan 24 09:55:44 <KaL>	tpopela: added some comments, got lost with the unit test :-(
Jan 24 09:59:03 <tpopela>	KaL, thanks! what the unit test does is just opening a dialog.. creating a new custom widget.. then it is moving to the tab where the widget is (the third one) and waits when the widget realized.. then it moves back to the first tab and jumps to the first printer and waits when the update signal is emitted.. then it just presses the return key to start printing with the print to file printer (that is set by gtkprintsetting
Jan 24 09:59:03 <tpopela>	previously).. now the apply signal is emitted and we wait until the print is finished..
Jan 24 10:02:23 <KaL>	I think the test is doing too much things in the test class, it should be a way to help wirint the test, not to write the test itself
Jan 24 10:08:10 <tpopela>	KaL, ok, I don't follow.. What is exactly wrong with writing the test like I've done it? What do you suggest.. Yes, the test case is not a simple one, but it does tests everything what we need..
Jan 24 10:09:37 <KaL>	nothing really wrong it's simply a lot more difficult to follow, you have to jump up and down to know the order in which things happen
Jan 24 10:10:27 <tpopela>	KaL, should I add a comment there that is explaining what the test is doing?
Jan 24 10:11:02 <KaL>	I think the tests done should be sequential in the test function, with the class as a helper
Jan 24 10:11:08 <KaL>	for example
Jan 24 10:11:17 <KaL>	createPrintOperation
Jan 24 10:11:22 <KaL>	createCustomwidget
Jan 24 10:11:27 <KaL>	add to the dialog
Jan 24 10:12:01 <KaL>	run dialog
Jan 24 10:12:06 <KaL>	select printer
Jan 24 10:12:08 <KaL>	etc.
Jan 24 10:12:34 <tpopela>	ok I will try to rework it..
Jan 24 10:13:23 <KaL>	check how other tests work (not all of them are good, though)
Jan 24 10:14:52 <tpopela>	and with "Why do we pass the widget? We have a getter, the user can simpler do get_widget in the callback, no?" I was trying to stick with the original gtk+ API, but I think that you are right and we don't need it there..
Jan 24 10:15:24 <KaL>	the original gtk+ doesn't have a getter for the widget, I guess
Jan 24 10:15:59 <tpopela>	KaL, yes it does not have it..
Jan 24 10:16:03 <KaL>	either pass the widget to the signals and remove the getters, or leave the getters and don't pass the widget
Jan 24 10:16:20 <KaL>	I'm fine with passing the widget and converting the getters to private
Jan 24 10:16:30 <KaL>	but since they are properties
Jan 24 10:16:40 <KaL>	it porbably makes more sense to leave the getters
Jan 24 10:18:29 <tpopela>	KaL, yes, I want to have getters there, so I will remove the widget from the signal..

Jan 25 10:57:31 <andoni>	hello! We are using webkitgtk+ in a C# application and in a clean machine, the first time the WebView is created, the UI thread is blocked for around 5s in OS X, 20s in Windows. Is webkit performing some kind of initialization (cache, fonts, etc..)  the first time it's run?
Jan 25 11:07:44 <andoni>	mmm, probably related to https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115650
Jan 25 11:08:50 <andoni>	but we are using 2.4.9
Jan 25 11:09:51 <mcatanzaro>	andoni: which is not supported for a long time. I counted 203 security vulnerabilities affecting it the other day. See https://webkitgtk.org/security.html. Windows is not supported by WebKit anymore so you'll need to either work on fixing that or use something else if you need to support Windows.
Jan 25 11:09:59 <mcatanzaro>	Sorry :/
Jan 25 11:13:51 <mcatanzaro>	andoni: Actually 204. And ~15-20 more to be released soon. :)
Jan 25 11:15:57 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: I believe you include vulnerabilities specific to Apple ports there
Jan 25 11:16:09 <aperezdc>	andoni: I can at least think about creation+initialization of the profile/cache directories on disk, but it is a bit strange that it would take that much time
Jan 25 11:16:10 <andoni>	mcatanzaro, thanks for the info, we just use it to render HTML produced by our application, I hope that reduces the impact of CVE's :)  I didn't know Windows was no longer supported
Jan 25 11:16:29 <aperezdc>	andoni: other than that, what mcatanzaro pointed out
Jan 25 11:16:41 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: We did in our 2015 advisories but KaL is supposed to be not counting Mac-specific ones there. Maybe he gets some wrong, but at least he doesn't include them if they only touch Mac/Cocoa files.
Jan 25 11:17:08 <aperezdc>	andoni: using it for local content that you have control over should be fine
Jan 25 11:17:28 <mcatanzaro>	*supposed to be not counting Mac-specific ones anymore. The last 2015 one was so huge since we couldn't get CVEs from Apple for most of the year, we just threw them all in indeed. ;)
Jan 25 11:17:47 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: good to know
Jan 25 11:17:51 <aperezdc>	andoni: make sure you prevent opening links from the Internet, e.g. you may want to use the API to open links with schemes other than "file://" using the system web browser
Jan 25 11:18:18 <andoni>	from the bug description it seems exactly what's happening to us, the first time the page is loaded it initializes plugins blocking the main thread, which are cached and the second run works. I'll try to find where this cache is written to to reproduce the issue more easily.
Jan 25 11:18:23 <andoni>	thanks for your help!

Jan 27 10:46:14 <alimiracle>	hi
Jan 27 10:47:40 <alimiracle>	can I use app:// Protocol in webkit gtk
Jan 27 10:47:40 <alimiracle>	 
Jan 27 10:48:15 <mcatanzaro>	alimiracle: Never heard of it, what does it do?
Jan 27 10:48:25 <mcatanzaro>	Probably not, unless it's a standard thing.
Jan 27 10:50:38 <alimiracle>	its use to open app useing html
Jan 27 10:51:06 <alimiracle>	I can use it in Mozilla Firefox
Jan 27 10:51:31 <mcatanzaro>	I guess you should try it and find out. :)
Jan 27 10:51:54 <alimiracle>	I try it and not run
Jan 27 10:52:04 <mcatanzaro>	Then I guess it doesn't work.
Jan 27 12:11:29 <aperezdc>	mmh, the best I can find is a reference here https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/Security
Jan 27 12:11:59 <aperezdc>	apparently it was (is?) used by FirefoxOS applications so they are provided with a separate unique origin
Jan 27 12:12:46 <aperezdc>	it doesn't look like any kind of formal W3C spec or anything, so I don't see why WebKitGTK+ should support it
Jan 27 12:13:00 <mcatanzaro>	He disconnected anyway
Jan 27 12:13:24 <aperezdc>	yeah, I just got curious not that I saw the conversation from earlier
Jan 27 12:14:32 <aperezdc>	being that way, I don't see the need to support app:// directly in WebKitGTK+, as it strikes me more like something people making a browser/runtime/etc would implement using the existing APIs to support custom URL schemes

Jan 31 05:52:06 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos, so that issue with i.e. duckduckgo actually still persists on trunk even after the AC changes. There is no assert nor anything in the output. Can you point me to someone who can help me to debug it? Žan or mgomez?
Jan 31 05:52:41 <tpopela>	KaL, forcing the AC or disabling it through the env variables does not help
Jan 31 05:53:40 <KaL>	tpopela: magomez or zdobersek, yes, it's weird that sometimes it happens and sometimes doesn't, and even more that it happens no matter whether AC is enabled or not
Jan 31 05:54:12 <KaL>	tpopela: check the inspector, maybe there are warnings or errors in the console
Jan 31 05:54:28 <magomez>	is there a bug created for that?
Jan 31 05:54:46 <tpopela>	KaL, I suspect that it happens reliably, but I was probably running epiphany with webkit from distribution..
Jan 31 05:55:18 <tpopela>	magomez, Hi, no I will create one.. Or we can "debug" it here if you want before I will create it..
Jan 31 05:56:27 <tpopela>	magomez, basically running run-minibrowser --gtk https://www.duckduckgo.com/webkit ends with (it's a screenshot from epi) - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29001959/Screenshot%20from%202017-01-26%2013-03-12.png
Jan 31 05:59:08 <KaL>	tpopela: does resizing the window (to force a relayout) change anything?
Jan 31 05:59:50 <tpopela>	magomez, intel broadwell hardware here with Intel® HD Graphics 5500 (Broadwell GT2) and here is glxgears -info output https://paste.fedoraproject.org/541425/60373148/
Jan 31 06:00:12 <tpopela>	KaL, no nothing
Jan 31 06:00:59 <tpopela>	KaL, actually there are some errors in the inspector.. not sure if related..
Jan 31 06:01:28 <tpopela>	KaL, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/541426/86048114/
Jan 31 06:03:34 <KaL>	no errors here in the console, so
Jan 31 06:03:36 <magomez>	I'm testing with latest ToT and minibrowser and I can't reproduce that empty page
Jan 31 06:04:29 <KaL>	tpopela: what build options did you use?
Jan 31 06:05:37 <tpopela>	KaL, nothing special build-webkit --gtk --release --no-media-stream --cmakeargs="-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DDEVELOPER_MODE=ON -DENABLE_GTKDOC=ON -DENABLE_INTROSPECTION=OFF"
Jan 31 06:06:15 <KaL>	no idea what's going on then
Jan 31 06:06:44 <tpopela>	KaL, and I'm not using the jhbuild..
Jan 31 06:07:55 <magomez>	does that happen even without AC mode?
Jan 31 06:08:07 <magomez>	the page automatically triggers it, BTW
Jan 31 06:08:35 <tpopela>	magomez, WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 run-minibrowser --gtk https://www.duckduckgo.com/webkit and the output is the same..
Jan 31 06:09:03 <tpopela>	magomez, yes, the page that don't trigger the AC are fine.. redhat bugzilla and others..
Jan 31 06:09:57 <tpopela>	magomez, https://github.com/personal is broken as well..
Jan 31 06:10:08 <tpopela>	magomez, and others too
Jan 31 06:11:18 <tpopela>	magomez, KaL and I forget to mention that I'm on Wayland..
Jan 31 06:11:31 <tpopela>	magomez, KaL I should maybe try X11 just to be sure..
Jan 31 06:12:52 <magomez>	yes, that would be useful
Jan 31 06:13:41 <tpopela>	magomez, btw the https://github.com/personal is actually good for the first time.. If I hit refresh then it's broken..
Jan 31 06:13:52 <tpopela>	magomez, ok, going to X11..
Jan 31 06:15:14 <magomez>	tpopela which wk revision are you using?
Jan 31 06:15:48 <tpopela>	trunk@211413
Jan 31 06:17:29 <magomez>	ok, so using WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 should work and using it means that no OpenGL is used at all
Jan 31 06:19:51 <zdobersek>	sounds like caching issues
Jan 31 06:21:42 <KaL>	oh, the cache!
Jan 31 06:26:54 <tpopela>	magomez, unchanged under X11..
Jan 31 06:27:13 <tpopela>	zdobersek, KaL yeah it indeed looks like cache problems..
Jan 31 06:27:18 <magomez>	that doesn't sound like a rendering issue then
Jan 31 06:27:24 <KaL>	remove the cache dir
Jan 31 06:28:39 <KaL>	I disscarded rendering issues when he said it happened without AC, but I didn't thought about the cache either, zdobersek to the rescue!
Jan 31 06:29:00 <tpopela>	KaL, where it is? I removed webkitgtk and webkit from .local/share, but no change..
Jan 31 06:29:29 <tpopela>	KaL, ah .cache :D
Jan 31 06:29:30 <zdobersek>	~~~/o/
Jan 31 06:29:30 <KaL>	tpopela: .cache/MiniBrowser

Jan 31 06:31:04 <tpopela>	KaL, zdobersek still the same :/
Jan 31 06:31:17 <KaL>	:-(
Jan 31 06:33:04 <tpopela>	guys I'm going to eat something for lunch and I'll be back in 15 minutes..

Jan 31 06:57:02 <tpopela>	KaL, yeah I know :D
Jan 31 07:00:38 <tpopela>	KaL, zdobersek, magomez meh.. something new.. the debug build works fine :/
Jan 31 07:01:17 <KaL>	tpopela: then try Release instead of RelWithDebInfo
Jan 31 07:01:44 <KaL>	I dn't even know what RelWithDebInfo does
Jan 31 07:03:13 <annulen>	in regular cmake, RelWithDebInfo is release configuration with debug info enabled
Jan 31 07:03:26 <annulen>	by default it also uses -O2 instead of -O3
Jan 31 07:03:42 <annulen>	however WebKit's build system does not support as of now
Jan 31 07:04:03 <annulen>	because many places check for "Debug" or "Release" only
Jan 31 07:04:28 <annulen>	or e.g. use CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE which is not affecting RelWithDebInfo
Jan 31 07:05:40 <annulen>	tpopela: if you want RelWithDebInfo without asserts and logging, take Release and set CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS to -g
Jan 31 07:06:26 <tpopela>	annulen, I want asserts and logging
Jan 31 07:08:36 <annulen>	then it's a bit harder
Jan 31 07:09:30 <zdobersek>	duckduckgo.com/webkit loads fine for me, r211363, X11, Debian stretch
Jan 31 07:11:36 <annulen>	tpopela: I think this patch should be enough to use Debug with optimization: https://0x0.st/VYy.txt
Jan 31 07:12:18 <annulen>	just add -O2 or -O3 to cxx flags
Jan 31 07:13:14 <annulen>	tpopela: oops, https://0x0.st/VYt.txt
Jan 31 08:30:12 <tpopela>	annulen, thanks.. I will try that later..
Jan 31 08:31:15 <tpopela>	rant.. gcc7 is not able to compile WebKitGTK+.. I'm curious how many bug reports I will have to fill..
Jan 31 08:42:03 <tpopela>	zdobersek, annulen, magomez, KaL the Release build works fine.. that's strange..
Jan 31 08:42:35 <mcatanzaro>	topela: I'm a bit concerned by any statement that begins with "build works fine" and ends in "that's strange"
Jan 31 08:42:52 <mcatanzaro>	What's wrong? :)
Jan 31 08:44:11 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: your timezone :-D
Jan 31 08:44:18 <tpopela>	KaL, :D:D
Jan 31 08:45:34 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro,  RelWithDebInfo build renders DuckDuckGo as https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29001959/Screenshot%20from%202017-01-26%2013-03-12.png for me..
Jan 31 08:45:41 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, that's in short..
Jan 31 08:46:19 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, the thing is that is has nothing to do with rendering.. as  https://github.com/personal is ok for the first load, then you refresh it and it is broken..
Jan 31 08:46:46 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Great news, that's https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163897
Jan 31 08:47:03 <mcatanzaro>	So now it no longer affects just Mageia, we can figure out what's going wrong. :P
Jan 31 08:47:55 <annulen>	tpopela: as I said earlier, RelWithDebInfo produces broken binaries by default, you at least need my patch
Jan 31 08:48:09 <annulen>	(will submit it to review soon)
Jan 31 08:48:24 <tpopela>	annulen, thanks! :)
Jan 31 08:48:47 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: What's broken...?
Jan 31 08:49:34 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: https://0x0.st/V6Z.txt
Jan 31 08:49:42 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Interesting that your DuckDuckGo screenshot is *exactly* the same as the complaints from the users who say Evolution is broken in Mageia.
Jan 31 08:49:51 <annulen>	 https://0x0.st/VYy.txt
Jan 31 08:49:59 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, because Evo is broken as well..
Jan 31 08:51:57 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: We've used RelWithDebInfo forever without problems until now. That's what all distros surely want to do, and we're not going to change that. So got to fix the build system. Really surprising to learn that there have been bugs with it the whole time.
Jan 31 08:52:13 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder why it started affecting Mageia so much sooner than Fedora.
Jan 31 08:53:03 <annulen>	many distros just add compilation flags instead of setting Release build type
Jan 31 08:53:33 <annulen>	-fno-strict-aliasing
Jan 31 08:53:54 <annulen>	without this flag webkit will be buggy as hell if build with optimization
Jan 31 09:14:41 <mcatanzaro>	annulen, tpopela: Um, our spec file *does* use Release O_O
Jan 31 09:15:08 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, I know.. my local build is using RelWithDebugInfo
Jan 31 09:15:19 <annulen>	ok, maybe it's just gentoo is being sloppy
Jan 31 09:15:36 <annulen>	I've checked debian, they use release too
Jan 31 09:18:07 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: You're confident -fno-strict-aliasing will fix https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163897?
Jan 31 09:18:13 *	mcatanzaro going to rename the bug
Jan 31 09:18:50 <annulen>	no I'm not, but it can break lots of things
Jan 31 09:19:23 <annulen>	and it's easy to get affected by this if you think you're smart :)
Jan 31 09:19:44 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: OK. You're planning to submit a patch to fix the build system...?
Jan 31 09:20:27 <annulen>	yes, but complete fix of alternative confs would require scanning all cmake sources
Jan 31 09:22:26 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Not possible to grep for something? CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE?
Jan 31 09:23:04 <annulen>	CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE and _RELEASE or _DEBUG variables
Jan 31 09:23:32 <annulen>	and decide what should be done in each case
Jan 31 09:24:07 <annulen>	also, -DNDEBUG is needed for production build, it's set by default in release conf but can be changed, or goes away in debug or empty configuration
Jan 31 09:24:44 <annulen>	otherwise civils start getting asserts
Jan 31 09:24:49 <mcatanzaro>	Which is a bug, because NDEBUG should be expected to be defined in release with debug mode....
Jan 31 09:25:07 <mcatanzaro>	We have a separate -DENABLE_ASSERTIONS right?
Jan 31 09:25:21 <mcatanzaro>	(...probably set based on NDEBUG though...)
Jan 31 09:25:21 <annulen>	it is but can be easily lost in distro packaging or custom builds
Jan 31 09:26:15 <mcatanzaro>	So has Mageia been running with assertions enabled this whole time, and nobody noticed or thought to report any bugs about it crashing constantly...? That seems a bit unlikely, even for them....
Jan 31 09:26:52 <annulen>	I need to look into spec
Jan 31 09:31:09 <annulen>	they use RelWithDebInfo indeed
Jan 31 09:32:14 <annulen>	ah, they pass -DNDEBUG explicitly
Jan 31 09:32:17 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Another problem: it's totally valid to not set any CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE. That needs to work too....
Jan 31 09:32:38 <annulen>	some people believe it's totally invalid to require setting CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
Jan 31 09:33:27 <annulen>	e.g. there are shithead in gentoo that believe every software in the world should be fixed for their cmake.eclass (I don't like such attitude but they exist)
Jan 31 09:33:59 <annulen>	it makes some sense actually because you can pass all c(xx)flags explictily
Jan 31 09:34:09 <annulen>	without assuming cmake default flags for some conf
Jan 31 09:34:29 <annulen>	also, empty build type is cmake's default mode
Jan 31 11:44:20 <tpopela>	KaL, btw should I land the custom print widgets patch?
Jan 31 11:46:45 <KaL>	tpopela: I'll review it tomorrow, ping me if I forget
Jan 31 11:47:00 <tpopela>	KaL, ok, np.. thank you!
Jan 31 11:47:03 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: are you ok with the api?
Jan 31 12:05:54 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: I haven't checked it recently, will look in a sec
Jan 31 12:06:36 <KaL>	tpopela: could you share your wip patch?
Jan 31 12:06:45 <tpopela>	KaL, doing it right now :)
Jan 31 12:06:51 <KaL>	cool
Jan 31 12:07:12 <tpopela>	done
Jan 31 12:07:14 <mcatanzaro>	API in bug #151998 looks OK to me, though I only looked briefly
Jan 31 12:09:11 <tpopela>	KaL, if you have any advice about that bug, please write it to the bug as I'm leaving the office (there is another 10 cm of new snow today, so I'm going to enjoy driving through the city :D)
Jan 31 12:09:49 <mcatanzaro>	cgarcia: We should do something about https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167491. Also the last memory pressure handler patch that landed right after your work, which added something small that's not implemented on GTK+ yet.
Jan 31 12:10:45 <tpopela>	KaL, and it's not related to frame flattening..

Feb 02 09:36:18 <tpopela>	it someone running current trunk? It started to not load any content for me :/ it's acting like it's stuck during downloading the content..
Feb 02 10:13:28 <lufimtse>	Hello, just curious. Are there situations where webkit_web_view_run_javascript () may not perform it's callback to results? (Ex if you run something while page is reloading or something like that?)
Feb 02 10:13:50 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: I think my checkout is a few days old
Feb 02 10:14:08 <mcatanzaro>	lufimtse: If so, that would be really crazy and surely a bug, but if you told me it was happening I would believe you.
Feb 02 10:14:17 <mcatanzaro>	(I don't know what the expected behavior would be in that case.)
Feb 02 10:15:03 <lufimtse>	I see
Feb 02 10:16:53 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, the one from yesterday worked for me.. the one I made today like 3 hours ago does not work..
Feb 02 10:18:01 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Please file a bug indicating the range of commits you think the bug was introduced in. Tests are still passing on the bots, which is not what I would expect if we had a big problem like this.
Feb 02 10:19:24 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, it's not strange that everything works as usual, but not for me :D

Feb 02 13:11:00 <rave>	does anybody know if accelerated compositing is enabled by default in the latest stable version of webkitgtk ?
Feb 02 13:11:15 <rave>	I am using 2.14.3
Feb 02 13:11:18 <mcatanzaro>	rave: It is
Feb 02 13:11:35 <mcatanzaro>	But it will be on-demand in 2.14.4
Feb 02 13:11:53 <rave>	mcatanzaro: Thanks, i see that some where it depends on the platform WIN_CAIRO ?
Feb 02 13:12:17 <rave>	mcatanzaro: i want to use it under linux
Feb 02 13:12:22 <mcatanzaro>	rave: Definitely not, WinCairo is a different WebKit port.
Feb 02 13:13:12 <rave>	mcatanzaro: oh ok , in Platform.h it says #if PLATFORM(WIN_CAIRO) #define USE_TEXTURE_MAPPER 1 #endif
Feb 02 13:13:55 <rave>	and if TEXTURE_MAPPER is 1 then it forces accelerated compositing in the code ?
Feb 02 13:14:08 <mcatanzaro>	I don't know.
Feb 02 13:14:33 <annulen>	rave: if WinCairo enables TextureMapper, it doesn't mean other ports don't
Feb 02 13:16:07 <rave>	annulen: maybe I am looking at the wrong place then , i don't see it anywhere in the code, maybe getting enabled form cmake flags?
Feb 02 13:16:10 <annulen>	rave: in gtk port, COORDINATED_GRAPHICS_THREADED needs to be enabled for accelerated compositing, but it also has run time option
Feb 02 13:17:16 <annulen>	rave: Source/cmake/OptionsGTK.cmake
Feb 02 13:18:45 <rave>	annulen: is that all the flags there ?
Feb 02 13:20:08 <annulen>	no, they are evenly distrbuted around code base :D
Feb 02 13:21:10 <annulen>	well. most of flags are set there, or inherited from WebKitFeatures.cmake, or in Platform.h
Feb 02 13:21:53 <rave>	annulen: oh ok I do see WEBKIT_FORCE_COMPOSITING_MODE for runtime ?
Feb 02 13:22:23 <rave>	annulen: so is COORDINATED_GRAPHICS_THREADED enabled by default ?
Feb 02 13:22:36 <annulen>	yep, if opengl is enabled
Feb 02 13:22:49 <annulen>	but at run time it can be disabled
Feb 02 13:23:25 <rave>	annulen: Thanks a lot :) Yeah found this WEBKIT_OPTION_DEFAULT_PORT_VALUE(ENABLE_THREADED_COMPOSITOR PUBLIC ON)
Feb 02 13:23:51 <rave>	annulen: does look like it is enabled :)
Feb 02 13:27:21 <rave>	is gtklauncher removed for Webkit2? I can see only MiniBrowser now
Feb 02 13:31:34 <annulen>	rave: GtkLauncher was test browser for webkit1
Feb 02 13:33:37 <rave>	oh ok Thanks
Feb 02 13:41:42 <rave>	is there a way to get default soup session from webkit, i know there was webkit_get_default_session in webkit 1
Feb 02 13:41:53 <rave>	but i don't see this in webkit2
Feb 02 13:42:11 <mcatanzaro>	rave: soup session is in the network process, there's no way to get it
Feb 02 13:42:49 <rave>	hmm ok
Feb 02 13:43:28 <rave>	is there a way to set ssl-strict just like webkit1?
Feb 02 13:43:59 <rave>	previously we could have set with g_object_set and soup session
Feb 02 13:45:59 <mcatanzaro>	rave: It's safe by default ;)
Feb 02 13:46:51 <rave>	mcatanzaro: do u mean ssl-strict is TRUE by default ?
Feb 02 13:47:08 <mcatanzaro>	rave: No, but you don't need it anymore.
Feb 02 13:48:25 <rave>	mcatanzaro: oh ok , i wanted to have it enable in the sense that it forces an error if there anything non-ssl ?
Feb 02 13:48:50 <mcatanzaro>	rave: That's the default behavior. Search the API for "tls" to familiarize yourself with your options... they are all for making things less secure than the default, which you only want if you're making your own web browser and really know what you're doing.
Feb 02 13:50:08 <rave>	mcatanzaro: ok , but something like customizing the cert locations etc, with webkit1 we generally had called ssl-ca-file to use one file and force it
Feb 02 13:50:51 <mcatanzaro>	rave: You can't do that anymore. Nobody's ever requested it!
Feb 02 13:51:42 <rave>	mcatanzaro: so right now there is no way to access soup session ?
Feb 02 13:52:32 <mcatanzaro>	rave: There will never be a way to access the soup session. We'd have to add a way to inject code into the network process, which would be complex and probably not useful.
Feb 02 13:53:14 <mcatanzaro>	What is it that you actually want to do, that you think requires access to the soup session?
Feb 02 13:54:40 <rave>	mcatanzaro: Need to change the location for ca files , also need to setup the Client Cert without dialog
Feb 02 13:55:14 <rave>	mcatanzaro: Client cert with the callbacks, i know with webkit1 we could do that with GTlsInteraction
Feb 02 13:55:20 <mcatanzaro>	rave: Why do you want to change the location for CA files?
Feb 02 13:55:39 <rave>	mcatanzaro: it is the way we need to setup our browser
Feb 02 13:56:33 <rave>	mcatanzaro: also Client Cert is something that would be tricky if we cannot obtain the session
Feb 02 13:56:33 <mcatanzaro>	rave: It might have been possible to use client certs in WebKit1 if you only started doing that recently, because only ~two years ago or thereabouts did libsoup gain support for that. But WebKit1 was already insecure and deprecated at that point. We've never had support for it in WebKit. I think someone was working on it recently though.
Feb 02 13:57:11 <rave>	mcatanzaro: True but still possible with soup session,
Feb 02 13:57:51 <mcatanzaro>	rave: I don't think we're going to add a way to change the location for CA files unless you have a really really good reason for wanting to do that. Your browser should use the system trust, not try to do its own thing. Client cert is going to need to be built-in to WebKit since you can't have access to the soup session, but that should not be controversial at least, just needs someone to finish the work.
Feb 02 13:58:08 *	mcatanzaro looks for client certificate bug
Feb 02 14:00:26 <mcatanzaro>	rave: I found https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=618429 but it's an Epiphany bug, and I don't see any patches there. ;/
Feb 02 14:01:03 <mcatanzaro>	rave: At least Sergio says he has a WebKit patch, but he did not post it. :(
Feb 02 14:08:56 <rave>	mcatanzaro: hmm :(
Feb 02 14:09:05 <rave>	mcatanzaro: thanks for finding the link
Feb 02 14:12:22 <bitlord>	one maybe offtopic quesion, something changed with webkit2 regarding cache, for example new liferea it doesn't seem to handle it well, or maybe I'm wrong ~/.cache/liferea becomes really big  (I have rc with webkit2)
Feb 02 14:13:28 <mcatanzaro>	bitlord: It's supposed to be limited to 100-150 MB or thereabouts. You're looking in ~/.cache/liferea/WebKitCache right?
Feb 02 14:13:44 <bitlord>	mcatanzaro, yes
Feb 02 14:13:59 <mcatanzaro>	And how big is it? What directories do you have inside it?
Feb 02 14:14:05 <bitlord>	for me that directory is ~490M now
Feb 02 14:14:38 <mcatanzaro>	bitlord: How many Version subdirectories do you have? (Hopefully only one?)
Feb 02 14:14:39 <bitlord>	inside Version10{/Blobs,/Records{...}}
Feb 02 14:14:47 <mcatanzaro>	OK that seems like a bug.
Feb 02 14:14:47 <bitlord>	yes, only one
Feb 02 14:15:11 <bitlord>	I'm running stable webkit (net-libs/webkit-gtk-2.14.3)
Feb 02 14:15:19 <mcatanzaro>	bitlord: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166428, can you add a comment there?
Feb 02 14:16:21 <bitlord>	let me check my accounts
Feb 02 14:20:46 <bitlord>	or maybe I was wrong, graphical file manager shows ~490M, while du  shows ~270M
Feb 02 15:15:04 <hussam>	regarding https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119477 , will something be implemented to purge left over WebKitWebProcess-*** files? right now I have a cron job that periodically removes them if they are not in the output of lsof
Feb 02 15:15:30 <hussam>	like after unclean browser exits
Feb 02 15:40:15 <rave>	is NetworkProcess spawned as a different thread? or is it just loaded with the UIProcess in webkit2?
Feb 02 18:00:41 <blino>	hussam: I also have some pending work to properly cleanup the WebProcess, not sure if this will solve this one
Feb 02 18:01:22 <hussam>	blino: ok :)
Feb 03 00:49:18 <mjog>	Hey all, is the webkit-gtk mailing list wedged? I've tried sending and resending a messages to it, and never saw it come back. Archives haven't been updated with it either.
Feb 03 05:38:56 <tpopela>	KaL, you should probably do something with https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167735
Feb 03 05:39:15 <tpopela>	KaL, as there is Joseph waiting for some input..
Feb 03 05:40:27 <KaL>	there are two bugs
Feb 03 05:42:57 <tpopela>	KaL, ok, but you patch fixes the bug that I sent you..
Feb 03 05:43:11 <KaL>	it's the same bug
Feb 03 05:44:53 <tpopela>	I know it's the same bug.. But you should close either 167776 in favor of 167735 or the other way (that makes more sense as you have a patch ready in 167776)

Feb 06 14:19:45 <rave>	I need to trap "console-message-sent" to print the console.log to stdout but looks like it is included from webkit-web-extension
Feb 06 14:20:17 <rave>	and I cannot use both webkit2.h and webkit-web-extension.h together
Feb 06 14:20:26 <rave>	is there any better way
Feb 06 14:22:07 <mcatanzaro>	rave: The console message API is a web process API, so you will need to write a web extension to use it if you don't have one already.
Feb 06 14:23:23 <rave>	so GTK doesn't have that ?
Feb 06 14:23:55 <rave>	i can see GTK provides it through WebKitConsoleMessage
Feb 06 14:24:19 <rave>	but is there a way that I can enable console logs to be sent to stdout ?
Feb 06 14:24:41 <annulen>	rave: https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitWebExtension.html
Feb 06 14:27:01 <rave>	does MiniBrowser Trap these messages ?
Feb 06 14:27:16 <rave>	or where does it show the console messages ?
Feb 06 14:28:07 <mcatanzaro>	rave: I think MiniBrowser only displays console messages in the web inspector. It doesn't use WebKitConsoleMessage.
Feb 06 14:28:20 <mcatanzaro>	It's not going to be a good example for you, because I don't think it has a web extension anyway.
Feb 06 14:29:08 <rave>	oh ok , i thought by default it also sends to stdout or so
Feb 06 14:29:17 <mcatanzaro>	No
Feb 06 14:29:31 <mcatanzaro>	Your stdout would be spammed by websites :)
Feb 06 14:29:46 <mcatanzaro>	You don't want to do that unless you're writing something special-purpose
Feb 06 14:30:42 <rave>	oh ok thanks :)
Feb 06 14:38:24 <rave>	mcatanzaro: found this webkit_settings_set_enable_write_console_messages_to_stdout
Feb 06 14:38:36 <rave>	mcatanzaro: works great :)
Feb 06 14:39:26 <mcatanzaro>	Oh, lucky :P
Feb 06 14:39:34 <mcatanzaro>	Didn't know about that
Feb 06 14:39:39 <rave>	mcatanzaro: lol ;)
Feb 06 17:34:38 <rave>	i am wondering is there a way to avoid spawning NetworkProcess in Webkit2 and have it in the same process (legacy style) ?
Feb 06 17:46:39 <lajava>	rave: there is the --single-process option
Feb 06 17:46:51 <lajava>	rave: not sure if it's what you were looking for
Feb 06 17:49:29 <rave>	lajava: does it spawn NetworkProcess as a thread ?
Feb 06 17:49:32 <rave>	with that option ?
Feb 06 17:52:32 <lajava>	umm, it seems that option is not available anymore ...
Feb 06 17:54:06 <lajava>	so I guess there is no way to have the NetworkProcess in the same process

Feb 07 14:24:27 <rave>	is there any way to disable cache from webkitgtk ? currently it spits out cache under ~/.cache directory
Feb 07 14:26:27 <mcatanzaro>	rave: If it's video files then https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119477 should fix it; nothing else should be created directly under ~/.cache. I don't think there's any way to totally disable disk cache but you can use WebKitWebsiteDataManager to change the cache dir to /tmp or something. Or if you're testing 2.15 you can use it to delete old cached files whenever you want.
Feb 07 14:28:20 <rave>	mcatanzaro: I do not want disk cache at all, like chrome incognito ?
Feb 07 14:29:03 <rave>	mcatanzaro: I think there was something with webkit1 but not sure for webkit2
Feb 07 14:32:08 <mcatanzaro>	rave: 2.15 has an ephemeral mode API, you'll want to use that
Feb 07 14:33:02 <mcatanzaro>	rave: Use https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/unstable/WebKitWebContext.html#webkit-web-context-new-ephemeral or https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/unstable/WebKitWebsiteDataManager.html#webkit-website-data-manager-new-ephemeral
Feb 07 14:33:25 <mcatanzaro>	Just make sure your WebKitWebView gets created using the appropriate WebKitWebContext or WebKitWebsiteDataManager
Feb 07 14:34:14 <rave>	ah but this is not yet in the stable branch ?
Feb 07 14:34:19 <rave>	i m on 2.14
Feb 07 14:34:24 <rave>	latest stable branch
Feb 07 14:34:29 <rave>	and this is since 2.16
Feb 07 14:35:27 <mcatanzaro>	rave: Right. In stable branch you'll have to hack around it somehow. Epiphany 3.22 sets the cache directory to something unique and then deletes it on close.
Feb 07 14:36:38 <mcatanzaro>	rave: There is also https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/unstable/WebKitSettings.html#webkit-settings-set-enable-private-browsing but it doesn't work properly and you probably shouldn't use it
Feb 07 14:36:43 <mcatanzaro>	Got to go now, good luck
Feb 07 14:38:19 <rave>	mcatanzaro: Thanks
Feb 08 10:18:31 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: I wrote a bit about your project at the bottom of https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2017/02/08/an-update-on-webkit-security-updates/
Feb 08 10:19:18 <mcatanzaro>	Challenge: who wants to figure out why links on my blog are visible in Firefox and Chrome always, but in WebKit only when hovered? :D
Feb 08 10:22:17 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: already saw it :)
Feb 08 10:22:30 <mcatanzaro>	Planets are good!
Feb 08 10:23:39 <annulen>	I read Igalia's tweets
Feb 08 10:23:50 <mcatanzaro>	oh we have a tweeter!
Feb 08 10:24:03 <annulen>	indeed!
Feb 08 10:24:04 *	mcatanzaro does not read tweets
Feb 08 10:24:12 *	mcatanzaro forgets we have a Tweeter ;)
Feb 08 10:24:34 *	mcatanzaro wonders who runs that account :P
Feb 08 10:28:22 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: about links in blog, looks like a bug in gtk port
Feb 08 10:28:33 <mcatanzaro>	:O
Feb 08 10:28:52 <mcatanzaro>	Feels like a CSS problem, but that's not really platform-specific
Feb 08 10:29:13 <mcatanzaro>	But I've seen stranger things
Feb 08 10:29:15 <annulen>	Qt shows links, GTK does not
Feb 08 10:29:49 <mcatanzaro>	But you're testing with your stable branch based on 2.12, right? It could have broken since then.
Feb 08 10:30:01 <annulen>	and webkitgtk 2.12
Feb 08 10:34:53 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: drawLinesForText for cairo is implemented by drawing rects, maybe cairo fails to draw rect with height less than 1px or smth like that
Feb 08 10:35:30 <mcatanzaro>	Hmm it's plausible
Feb 08 10:36:56 <aperezdc>	mmh, I distinctevely remember using 1px line heights for border-bottom on links myself, and it works in WebKitGTK+
Feb 08 10:36:56 <aperezdc>	I'm suspecting some interaction with the CSS transition
Feb 08 10:37:54 <aperezdc>	unfortunately, the inspector does not want to work today for me
Feb 08 10:37:59 <aperezdc>	~_ ~
Feb 08 10:38:25 <mcatanzaro>	aperezdc: Could it be the DrawArrays crash magomez fixed last week? Inspector crashes on that for jacobo when he tries to open it.
Feb 08 10:39:03 <MonkeyofDoom>	related (to inspector fail), has anyone seen a bug where the inspector (2.14.3) can't find language files and crashes with repeated exceptions when locale isn't english?
Feb 08 10:39:29 <aperezdc>	mcatanzaro: yes, I am looking at the backtrace, seems to be the same magomez fixed
Feb 08 10:39:30 <mcatanzaro>	MonkeyofDoom: Nope. Best report it quick as you're about to miss 2.14.4 ;)
Feb 08 10:39:47 <aperezdc>	somehow I hadn't been using the inspector lately and didn't see the crash before myself
Feb 08 10:40:27 <MonkeyofDoom>	mcatanzaro: it's not a new bug, just still-around
Feb 08 10:41:27 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, do you know when is Carlos planning to release 2.14.4? I have a one build fix (but the compilation here is so slow today)..
Feb 08 10:44:53 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Soon (this week).
Feb 08 10:54:06 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, So I'm fine unless it will be tonight :D
Feb 08 11:14:09 <MonkeyofDoom>	mcananzaro: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167991
Feb 08 11:14:11 <KaL>	yes, at some point this week
Feb 08 11:15:06 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: ^ bug is that inspector always crashes in Spanish locale... but you test that regularly right...?
Feb 08 11:15:29 <KaL>	right
Feb 08 11:15:52 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: echo $LANG?
Feb 08 11:16:06 <MonkeyofDoom>	es_ES works, es_ES.utf8 does not
Feb 08 11:16:08 <KaL>	es_ES.utf8
Feb 08 11:16:13 <mcatanzaro>	I guess one possible difference is Debian uses .utf8 extensions for locales, but other distros use .UTF-8
Feb 08 11:16:39 <mcatanzaro>	So you have exactly the same locale... strange
Feb 08 11:16:53 <MonkeyofDoom>	every other GTK3 program works fine with these settings... dunno
Feb 08 11:17:37 <KaL>	what wk version?
Feb 08 11:17:46 <MonkeyofDoom>	2.14.3
Feb 08 11:17:50 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: Look at the bug :P
Feb 08 11:17:53 <MonkeyofDoom>	haha
Feb 08 11:18:16 <KaL>	what bug?
Feb 08 11:18:30 <KaL>	let me try in 2.14 branch
Feb 08 11:18:35 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167991
Feb 08 11:18:43 <KaL>	thanks for git worktree that's easy now!
Feb 08 11:19:22 <KaL>	*thanks to
Feb 08 11:19:46 <mcatanzaro>	:P
Feb 08 11:19:55 <KaL>	works for me in 2.14
Feb 08 11:20:20 <MonkeyofDoom>	do you know what logic is dependent on the value of LANG?
Feb 08 11:20:26 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: I already landed the critical warnings as part of the original patch
Feb 08 11:20:41 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: OK thanks, you can remove it from the wiki then
Feb 08 11:21:15 <KaL>	I'll start with the secutiry bugs tomorrow
Feb 08 11:22:55 <KaL>	MonkeyofDoom: what icu version?
Feb 08 11:23:12 <KaL>	I think i fixed that isue in the tests by upgrading icu
Feb 08 11:24:40 <MonkeyofDoom>	58.2
Feb 08 11:25:43 <aperezdc>	BTW, if somebody feels like reviewing a super small patch → https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167993
Feb 08 11:26:09 <KaL>	that should be recent enough
Feb 08 11:27:38 <aperezdc>	FWIW, now that both KaL and mcatanzaro are around, it would be nice to talk about the API I am proposing here: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154553#c11 -- when you have some spare cycles ;-)
Feb 08 11:37:11 *	mcatanzaro has already left his thoughts on Bugzilla
Feb 08 11:37:22 <mcatanzaro>	KaL, please do check out that API proposal if you have time
Feb 08 11:37:44 <aperezdc>	I'll reply to your comment, mcatanzaro
Feb 08 11:38:17 <mcatanzaro>	In particular, we argued a bit yesterday over whether WebKitUserContentManager should respect WebKitWebsiteData base-cache-dir and base-data-dir. I think all data WebKit stores should be under those directories, but aperez points out that this actually isn't "website data".
Feb 08 11:44:18 <KaL>	it isn't website data
Feb 08 11:44:34 <KaL>	website data is data that websites store on client side, not data sortrded by the client itself
Feb 08 11:44:39 <KaL>	stored
Feb 08 11:44:46 <aperezdc>	KaL: I said the same yesterday
Feb 08 11:45:13 <aperezdc>	I have just posted this comment trying to clarify that: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154553#c14
Feb 08 11:45:42 <aperezdc>	hopefully I didn't write things in a way that makes it more confusing O:-)
Feb 08 11:50:05 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: I think it's important that WebKit stores all its data in one place by default, though.
Feb 08 11:50:16 <KaL>	its data
Feb 08 11:50:25 <KaL>	website data is not its data
Feb 08 11:51:20 <mcatanzaro>	So how to you propose that be handled...?
Feb 08 11:53:23 <aperezdc>	I think the API should allow setting the path where to store it
Feb 08 11:53:40 <aperezdc>	that's why I added webkit_user_content_data_manager_new(path)
Feb 08 11:54:16 <aperezdc>	it may even make sense to not have webkit_user_content_data_manager_get_default()
Feb 08 11:54:47 <aperezdc>	so we always force developers to be conscious about where their application stores things
Feb 08 11:55:21 <KaL>	I don't have a rpoposal because I haven't looked a it in detail yet
Feb 08 11:55:38 <KaL>	I'll fo sure when I find some time
Feb 08 11:55:53 <aperezdc>	KaL, I know you're busy this week, so feel free to take a look later
Feb 08 11:56:00 *	mcatanzaro just wants to avoid different settings in different places for controlling directory layout
Feb 08 11:56:39 <aperezdc>	mcatanzaro: you are starting to think dangerously like GNOME designers, trying to remove a bit too many things ;-)
Feb 08 11:56:40 <KaL>	if they are different things, they are different things
Feb 08 11:57:52 <aperezdc>	one reason why I went with the name WebKitUserContentDataManager was that at some point in the future we may want to tie more kinds of “local, non website data” (= user content) to it
Feb 08 11:58:20 <aperezdc>	precisely to not have WebKitUserContentExtensionsDataManager, and later on a WebKitUserContent${FOO}DataManager
Feb 08 11:58:53 <aperezdc>	(mmh, maybe I should have commented this in the bug discussion, too)
Feb 08 12:32:57 <rave>	is there any way to set the proxy for webkitgtk, i can see http_proxy is not used anymore
Feb 08 12:32:58 <rave>	?
Feb 08 12:36:31 <aperezdc>	rave: you may want to look into https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/unstable/WebKitNetworkProxySettings.html
Feb 08 12:37:15 <aperezdc>	there is going to be a release soonish, so you may want to already start planning on using the new WebKitNetworkProxySettings API
Feb 08 12:37:43 <rave>	ah, i m on the last stable branch
Feb 08 12:37:56 <rave>	that API is not there in 2.14.3
Feb 08 12:38:34 <mcatanzaro>	rave: On the stable branch, you will need to write your own GProxyResolver and inject it at runtime via a loadable GIO module
Feb 08 12:38:41 <mcatanzaro>	I have no clue how to do that and it will probably be a lot of wokr
Feb 08 12:38:43 <mcatanzaro>	*work
Feb 08 12:38:45 <mcatanzaro>	But it's possible.
Feb 08 12:39:01 <rave>	but is there no default proxy resolver ?
Feb 08 12:39:03 <mcatanzaro>	Would certainly be easier to depend on 2.16 and use the new aPI
Feb 08 12:39:07 <mcatanzaro>	rave: There is a default proxy resolver
Feb 08 12:39:17 <mcatanzaro>	rave: It uses your desktop proxy settings by default
Feb 08 12:39:19 <rave>	they how would it pick the proxy ?
Feb 08 12:39:38 <rave>	i am using desktop less env, any ideas if it picks http_proxy too ?
Feb 08 12:39:50 <aperezdc>	rave: it should pick http_proxy, yes
Feb 08 12:40:02 <aperezdc>	the default resolver is supposed to handle it
Feb 08 12:40:15 <mcatanzaro>	rave: I think it should, yes. Provided you don't have any GNOME-related environment variables set (e.g. DESKTOP_SESSION)
Feb 08 12:40:19 <rave>	oh ok , is that default handler in libsoup ?
Feb 08 12:40:35 <mcatanzaro>	You should probably check for yourself
Feb 08 12:40:42 <aperezdc>	if you are running some GNOME service (E.g. gnome-settings-daemon) you can configure your proxy from the GNOME control center
Feb 08 12:40:49 <aperezdc>	even if you are not using the rest of GNOME
Feb 08 12:41:27 *	aperezdc  uses i3 sometimes, and just runs a few GNOME services to make sure all works flawlessly and there's no need to reconfigure things
Feb 08 12:42:35 <rave>	oh ok, thanks aperezdc and mcatanzaro
Feb 08 12:42:48 <rave>	I am not running any gnome services
Feb 08 12:42:57 <rave>	but will try http_proxy then
Feb 08 12:46:08 <rave>	voila it worked
Feb 08 12:46:10 <rave>	thanks
Feb 08 12:50:31 <aperezdc>	rave: you're welcome!
Feb 08 12:51:09 <aperezdc>	and if you are using WebKitGTK+ for developing some app, waiting for the next release to use the new proxy settings API is probably the easiest thing to do
Feb 08 13:06:35 <rave>	yeah i m thinking of that because in latest i can see we can disable disk cache
Feb 08 13:06:42 <rave>	and not in latest stable version
Feb 08 13:07:18 <rave>	i want webkit to not write anything on the disk,
Feb 08 13:13:22 *	aperezdc  is no fan of jhbuild, but it's also true that there aren't many alternatives
Feb 08 13:13:40 <aperezdc>	(except from rolling our own prefix-installation thingy)
Feb 08 13:14:00 <mcatanzaro>	Well we are hoping to replace it in GNOME with BuildStream, maybe later this year. We'll have to see how that goes.
Feb 08 13:14:12 <mcatanzaro>	aperezdc: Seems we changed rooms again! :P
Feb 08 13:14:32 <aperezdc>	mmh, gotta read about buildstream
Feb 08 13:14:51 <aperezdc>	but I was rather unimpressed from a quick look
Feb 08 18:36:54 <rave>	does anybody know about dconf ?
Feb 08 18:37:13 <rave>	is there any way to disable writing dconf cache ?

Feb 09 07:26:53 <blino>	slomo: thanks for your feedback on the GstAutoplugSelectResult enum
Feb 09 07:27:51 <slomo>	blino: sure, np :)
Feb 09 07:28:11 <slomo>	you can come to #gstreamer if you have more questions btw
Feb 09 07:31:37 <blino>	alright, thanks
Feb 09 08:42:59 <aperezdc>	KaL, mcatanzaro: so, shall I use “#if USE(SOUP) && PLATFORM(GTK)” for guarding the adoptAndMapFile(GFileIOStream*)? or should I add the GIO CFLAGS to EFL?
Feb 09 08:43:24 <aperezdc>	if EFL is not using FileSystemGtk it looks to me that guarding is probably cleaner
Feb 09 08:43:40 <aperezdc>	but at this point I have no clear idea of what's better O:-)
Feb 09 08:45:53 <aperezdc>	(as a side note, I've came up with a solution to make the thing build with GCC 4.9 that alexchristensen may like better, I've already commented suggesting it)
Feb 09 08:52:12 <KaL>	aperezdc: only platform GTK
Feb 09 08:53:01 <aperezdc>	KaL: I like that, it's even simpler, thanks!
Feb 09 12:17:58 <aperezdc>	oh, clang in mac does not like an initializer-list for constructing statics... sigh
Feb 09 12:18:28 *	aperezdc  reworks a patch, thanks the EWSs for their job
Feb 09 13:19:29 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela, rishi: This kerberos thing is really awesome magic
Feb 09 13:19:46 <mcatanzaro>	I just click the login button on Fedora sites and I get logged in, no password :O
Feb 09 13:19:53 *	mcatanzaro never seen something like this before
Feb 09 13:20:15 <mcatanzaro>	And I didn't do anything to set it up besides sign in in g-o-a
Feb 09 13:33:27 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Of course. :P
Feb 09 13:33:59 <rishi>	I am glad you like it.
Feb 09 13:54:32 <rave>	anybody knows about dconf here ? When I try to run webkitgtk , it creates a dconf dir into .cache dir
Feb 09 13:54:49 <rave>	wondering what is this used for and how can I disable it ?
Feb 09 13:56:38 <mcatanzaro>	rave: Settings... it would be possible to disable by uninstalling dconf, but then none of your applications will remember their settings
Feb 09 13:57:29 <rave>	mcatanzaro: thanks , will try if that makes difference
Feb 09 13:57:48 <mcatanzaro>	It's a GIO extension point, so you could replace it with your own settings backend if desired. Writing your own GSettingsBackend would be the same deal as writing your own GProxyResolver. You probably don't want to, though.
Feb 09 13:58:00 <mcatanzaro>	Ah there is an environment vaiable
Feb 09 13:58:09 <mcatanzaro>	rave: Try G_SETTINGS_BACKEND=memory
Feb 09 13:58:30 <mcatanzaro>	(Settings remembered in memory until your program quits. Not a very good way to store settings. :)
Feb 09 13:58:31 <rave>	let me try that
Feb 09 13:58:39 <mcatanzaro>	WebKit doesn't use it I think, but GTK+ does.
Feb 09 13:59:37 <rave>	no luck , still get error (process:2630): dconf-CRITICAL **: unable to create directory '/root/.cache/dconf': Permission denied.  dconf will not work properly.
Feb 09 13:59:48 <rave>	means it is trying to create that directory
Feb 09 14:00:06 <rave>	i have blocked .cache for non root user
Feb 09 14:00:12 <mcatanzaro>	rave: Don't try to run GTK+ as root... that's totally unsupported.
Feb 09 14:00:27 <rave>	it is running as non root
Feb 09 14:00:36 <mcatanzaro>	Then why is it trying to write to /root/.cache?
Feb 09 14:00:58 <mcatanzaro>	Something is very wrong there. :)
Feb 09 14:01:17 <rave>	it is setup in this way, using same home dir
Feb 09 14:01:30 <rave>	hmm
Feb 09 14:04:21 <rave>	mcatanzaro: r u sure that is the right env var ?
Feb 09 14:06:42 <mcatanzaro>	rave: Nope!
Feb 09 14:07:22 <rave>	oh ok , searching if I can find anything to set that :P
Feb 09 14:07:25 <mcatanzaro>	Ah, GSETTINGS_BACKEND :S
Feb 09 14:07:29 <mcatanzaro>	Only one underscore
Feb 09 14:07:32 <mcatanzaro>	https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GSettingsBackend.html
Feb 09 14:09:38 <rave>	mcatanzaro: voila it works :)
Feb 09 14:09:45 <rave>	mcatanzaro: super thanks for the link
Feb 09 14:10:34 <rave>	mcatanzaro: btw, i was looking at the NetworkCache code and saw that if I disable the access to .cache, i will not create any storage and works same as like disabling disk cache
Feb 09 14:11:19 <rave>	mcatanzaro: so rt now only memory caching is enabled if I do not allow user to create any cache
Feb 09 14:11:21 <rave>	dir

Feb 13 09:08:34 <danw>	morning
Feb 13 09:08:42 <KaL>	danw: do you plan to make a new libsoup release soon?
Feb 13 09:09:00 <KaL>	I have a couple of simple patches I want in
Feb 13 09:09:23 <KaL>	they fix wk layout tests, so I was considering adding patches to our jhbuild
Feb 13 09:09:40 <KaL>	or wait for a libsoup release and simply update the version in the jhbuild instead
Feb 13 09:09:53 <danw>	i'll probably do a tarball tonight, and probably look at the pending patches in bugzilla before that
Feb 13 09:10:15 <KaL>	danw: cool, thanks!
Feb 13 09:10:34 <KaL>	danw: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777936 and https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778497 are the ones I need
Feb 13 09:10:46 <danw>	ok
Feb 13 09:10:59 <KaL>	they are fixes to the new SOUP_MESSAGE_DO_NOT_USE_AUTH_CACHE flag
Feb 13 09:36:21 <mcatanzaro>	danw: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/page.cgi?id=patchreport.html&product=libsoup&patch-status=none is the best way to look at pending patches... might want to clear some of the older ones too
Feb 13 09:36:48 <mcatanzaro>	I see a couple recent deadlock fixes there, hmm

Feb 14 10:52:09 <mcatanzaro>	Hey garnacho__, I'm hitting this critical each time I open a combo box in WebKit: "xdg_popup_configure: assertion 'impl->transient_for' failed". It's coming from gdkwindow-wayland.c:1549. Our bug our your bug? :)
Feb 14 10:52:30 <mcatanzaro>	If it's our bug, it'd be nice if GDK would complain earlier than that as it's pretty deep in the Wayland backend.
Feb 14 11:01:20 <mcatanzaro>	*Our bug or your bug?
Feb 14 11:02:58 <garnacho__>	mcatanzaro: depends on how much of a real combo box it is :). do you have a bt?
Feb 14 11:04:03 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho__: https://paste.gnome.org/pjzuon8hu
Feb 14 11:05:23 <mcatanzaro>	Maybe KaL would know how how "real" our combo boxes are. :)

Feb 15 03:49:32 <aperezdc>	it'll be nice to have the HiDPI fix in distro packages :-)
Feb 15 03:49:54 <berto>	aperezdc: building for debian now
Feb 15 03:51:15 <KaL>	thanks! and sorry for the issues
Feb 15 03:51:24 <aperezdc>	berto: awesome! it's cool to see distros picking updates quicker nowadays
Feb 15 04:03:54 <berto>	this one is still open https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167377
Feb 15 04:05:48 <tpopela>	aperezdc, Fedora is building it as well ;)
Feb 15 04:06:37 <berto>	tpopela: are you having that problem? ^
Feb 15 04:06:42 <berto>	do you have ppc64 in fedora=?
Feb 15 04:07:07 <tpopela>	berto, I just CC'ed to it.. didn't saw any report so far about it..
Feb 15 04:07:34 <berto>	tpopela: https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=seed-webkit2&suite=sid
Feb 15 04:07:39 <berto>	see the build logs for ppc64el
Feb 15 04:07:51 <tpopela>	berto, but as I will have to touch the "obscure arches" soon I will at least try to reproduce it here..
Feb 15 04:11:18 <aperezdc>	tpopela: \o/
Feb 15 04:11:44 <tpopela>	berto, and does it happen with 2.15.4 as well?
Feb 15 04:13:45 <berto>	tpopela: I haven't tried that yet
Feb 15 04:14:02 <berto>	I will in a while
Feb 15 04:14:31 <tpopela>	berto, I think that it's worth trying.. and let me know how it ended up..
Feb 15 04:14:40 *	tpopela is moving to the office..
Feb 15 04:48:59 <berto>	tpopela: also fails, with 2.15.3-1
Feb 15 04:49:18 <berto>	the problem may be in seed-webkit2 of course
Feb 15 04:49:54 <tpopela>	tpopela, ok, let me try to fire a scratch build here.. I don't think.. usually the problem is in JSC :D
Feb 15 04:50:25 <berto>	:)
Feb 15 04:52:02 <berto>	yeah, earlier versions of seed-webkit2 also segfault
Feb 15 04:55:13 <tpopela>	berto, seed-webkit2 is some fork or what is it?
Feb 15 04:56:27 <tpopela>	berto, it looks like we don't have that package in Fedora and seed is build against WK1, that's why we don't have any failures here :)
Feb 15 04:57:57 <tpopela>	berto, ah ok - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1375841
Feb 15 04:58:04 <berto>	I don't know
Feb 15 04:58:19 <tpopela>	let me fire a scratch build here..
Feb 15 11:39:02 <aperezdc>	gotta ❤️ Arch Linux, version 2.14.5 has just hit the mirrors :-)
Feb 15 11:40:09 <mcatanzaro>	gotta ❤️ Fedora, version 2.14.4 never went out to users because we have this "updates-testing" thing ;)
Feb 15 11:40:44 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela has 2.14.5 submitted for testing already, but it won't actually reach users until next week. Because testing!
Feb 15 11:41:07 <annulen>	Arch tests packages on users
Feb 15 11:41:57 <aperezdc>	annulen: well, you have to opt-in for the "testing" repository
Feb 15 11:42:13 <aperezdc>	people in "stable" (the default) will never get 2.14.4
Feb 15 11:42:50 <aperezdc>	I am in testing because I like living in the edge (and I get the webkitgtk+ releases sooner :P)
Feb 15 11:43:40 <annulen>	btw, https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/qt5-webkit-ng/
Feb 15 11:44:55 <aperezdc>	it was a good thing that I am in "testing" because that way I caught the HiDPI rendering issue even without having time the previous weeks to build unstable myself
Feb 15 11:45:00 <aperezdc>	annulen: oh, neat!
Feb 15 13:12:28 <rave>	is there any good test that spits out all the features currently enabled in the browser ? like html5 video/audio css etc
Feb 15 13:12:35 <rave>	a kind of a full feature set
Feb 15 13:14:10 <aperezdc>	rave: how about http://html5test.com/ ?
Feb 15 13:25:38 <rave>	aperezdc:thats for just html5 , i was looking for something more in details
Feb 15 14:25:14 <rave>	is there any way that a Javascript console messages are redirected to a file (size bound log)?
Feb 15 14:25:52 <mcatanzaro>	rave: You can implement that using the WebKitConsoleMessage API. There's no built-in functionality to do that.
Feb 15 14:26:51 <rave>	mcatanzaro: oh ok thanks, does MiniBrowser use this?
Feb 15 14:27:01 <mcatanzaro>	No
Feb 15 14:27:54 <rave>	mcatanzaro: ok thanks
Feb 15 14:30:14 <rave>	mcatanzaro: were u talking about catching "console-message-sent" signal and then using WebKitConsoleMessage ?
Feb 15 14:39:19 <aperezdc>	rave: though there is a MiniBrowser option to send console output to stdout, if that would work for you
Feb 15 14:40:41 <rave>	aperezdc: yes I am using that, but was thinking to log manually to a file natively instead of redirecting stdout to a file through shell
Feb 15 14:40:50 <mcatanzaro>	rave: Yup
Feb 15 16:30:07 <rave>	mcatanzaro: this can only work in extension ?
Feb 15 16:30:39 <mcatanzaro>	rave: Yup
Feb 15 16:30:46 <rave>	mcatanzaro: :P

Feb 17 11:59:04 <lufimtse>	Hello. Webkit2 introduces a lot of functions to get/set settings.(WebKitSettings). Is it still safe to use g_object_set(... "property") ?
Feb 17 11:59:17 <lufimtse>	g_object_set(...) was used in webkit1
Feb 17 11:59:21 <mcatanzaro>	lufimtse: Yup
Feb 17 11:59:32 <lufimtse>	mcatanzaro, thank you
Feb 17 13:59:27 <DimStar>	Hi everybody; as part of the openSUSE integration process we're building webkitgtk prereleases; It came to my attention that 2.15.4 is no longer building for ppc64le (previous versions did); are such bugs going to be handled or do you consider ppc64le as 'no target' ?
Feb 17 14:29:51 <mcatanzaro>	DimStar: Patches welcome
Feb 17 14:30:00 <mcatanzaro>	Not something we'll work on ourselves though
Feb 17 14:30:26 <mcatanzaro>	DimStar: Be sure to select the WebKitGTK+ component if you report a bug on WebKit Bugzilla to ensure a timely response.
Feb 17 14:31:06 <mcatanzaro>	DimStar: Also, Debian has patches for it that have not been submitted upstream, you could try one of those
Feb 17 14:40:12 <DimStar>	mcatanzaro: thanks; I'll have a look what kind of patches debian carries then
Feb 17 14:40:46 <mcatanzaro>	DimStar: Actually they haven't updated to 2.15 yet, I just remembered they have a lot of fixes for secondary arches that they have not upstreamed
Feb 17 14:42:13 <DimStar>	mcatanzaro: 2.15.2 still built fine... hence can't really say what their patches fix / don't fix...
Feb 17 14:45:05 <DimStar>	mcatanzaro: it's apparently sparc and m68k patches
Feb 17 14:49:37 <DimStar>	http://paste.opensuse.org/65319898 makes no sense to me in any case
Feb 17 14:50:20 <mcatanzaro>	DimStar: That's normally a missing #include somewhere
Feb 17 14:52:34 <mcatanzaro>	DimStar: It's fixed by Debian actually. :P https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/211624
Feb 17 14:52:41 <mcatanzaro>	So no need to report it
Feb 17 14:53:25 <DimStar>	ah - the special thing is JIT being disabled on ppc which is ot on the others... go figure :)
Feb 17 14:53:30 <DimStar>	thanks for the pointer!

Mar 06 09:26:51 <davidnlk>	can webkit-gtk be compiled on windows?
Mar 06 09:32:07 <davidnlk>	if so, how?
Mar 06 09:36:52 <aperezdc1>	davidnlk: current webkitgtk+ does not support Windows
Mar 06 09:37:07 <davidnlk>	oh :(
Mar 06 09:37:12 <davidnlk>	thanks anyway
Mar 06 09:37:16 <aperezdc1>	not that it would be impossible -- it's just that nobody has ever cared to have the WebKit2-based GTK+ port built and running
Mar 06 09:38:05 <aperezdc1>	when we were using WebKit1 there was support windows, but that's very old 2.4.x releases with (literally!) hundreds of security issues fixed since then
Mar 06 09:38:47 <aperezdc1>	so I cannot recommend using them, unless you are only going to use it for loading content that you control, and you will never ever make WebKitGTK load resources from Internet
Mar 06 09:39:37 <aperezdc1>	we would be more than happy to have someone contribute and maintain support for Windows in modern webkitgtk+, but so far nobody has stepped up to help :-|

Mar 06 13:08:38 <yaneti>	hello. recently I've had a lot of crashes of WebKitProcess (as used by liferea) in GIFLZWContext::doLZW,  on looping gifs, mainly from the thevirge rss feed
Mar 06 13:09:03 <yaneti>	this on rawhide.  ring any bells? should I try to condense a bug about it..
Mar 06 13:09:22 <mcatanzaro>	magomez{M}1, could it be related to what you fixed recently, or should yaneti file a new bug?
Mar 06 13:09:43 <yaneti>	webkitgtk4-2.15.91-1.fc27.x86_64 currently
Mar 06 13:11:26 <yaneti>	has been going on for the last few webkitgtk releases... if my memory serves
Mar 06 13:29:27 <mcatanzaro>	yaneti: It's probably https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166838 which I'm about to dup to another bug
Mar 06 13:29:39 <mcatanzaro>	So I'd say: don't worry about it unless you can reproduce after that upstream bug gets closed
Mar 06 13:34:27 <yaneti>	mcatanzaro: thanks, I'll keep an eye out
Mar 06 14:04:10 <Tirifto_>	Hello! I've sent an e-mail to the mailing lists a while back in February. If it's not in the archives, that probably means it didn't get through; right?
Mar 06 14:07:13 <mcatanzaro>	Yup
Mar 06 18:01:22 <jumpyjumps>	Can I ask about the homebrew version of webkit2gtk (webkitgtk) on macOS at the moment? A minimal, empty web view segfaults in frame #0: 0x0000000100df8cb7 libwebkit2gtk-4.0.37.dylib`WTF::ThreadIdentifierData::initialize(unsigned int) + 59
Mar 07 08:23:28 <aperezdc1>	has anyone seen the discussion about GtkFileChooserNative in #gnome-design?
Mar 07 08:24:31 <aperezdc1>	The summary is: maybe WebKitGTK+ should use GtkFileChooserNative by default if available in the GTK+ version being used. That way, applications using WebKitGTK+ would use the file chooser portal when sandboxed e.g. with Flatpak
Mar 07 08:25:35 <aperezdc1>	(of course, one can handle WebKitWebView::run-file-chooser and do it in the application code, but still it may be a good idea that the default implementation uses GtkFileChooserNative)
Mar 07 08:25:36 <aperezdc1>	thoughts?
Mar 07 08:45:23 <tpopela>	aperezdc1, definitely a good idea.. we should work out of the box when running in flatpak.. I didn't look to the sources, but are we doing something extra/non-standard with the file chooser dialog?
Mar 07 08:46:49 <tpopela>	aperezdc1, what was the initial "problem" - what app that is using WebKitGTK+ was running in flatpak? Epi?
Mar 07 09:09:54 <aperezdc1>	tpopela: it seemed pretty stock GtkFileChooserDialog usage, let me open the source again
Mar 07 09:10:16 <aperezdc1>	tpopela: the trigger of the discussion was this → https://github.com/aperezdc/revolt/issues/46
Mar 07 09:10:56 <aperezdc1>	because the Flatpak is finished with "--filesystem=xdg-pictures --filesystem=xdg-documents" and mclasen suggested that portals should be used if possible
Mar 07 09:11:47 <aperezdc1>	using GtkFileChooserNative of course would be good also for Epiphany and virtually any other application which uses WebKitGTK+ and ends up being run in a sandbox
Mar 07 09:12:01 *	aperezdc1  files a ticket in b.g.o.
Mar 07 09:12:04 <mcatanzaro>	Yup, definitely required
Mar 07 09:12:07 <aperezdc1>	s/b.g.o./b.w.o./
Mar 07 09:12:08 <tpopela>	aperezdc1, that makes sense indeed..
Mar 07 09:12:26 <aperezdc1>	I can try to make a patch later today, too
Mar 07 09:12:33 <aperezdc1>	it does look reasonably easy

Mar 07 09:35:34 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, ah sorry you probably already know about that bug.. I didn't checked the time on #fedora-desktop..
Mar 07 10:03:54 <aperezdc1>	mcatanzaro: reading the documentation of GtkFileChooserNative, it is quite clear to me that MIME-type based filters are supported in the Flatpak portal
Mar 07 10:04:17 *	aperezdc1  hasn't checked the code of GtkFileChooserNative, though
Mar 07 10:04:21 <aperezdc1>	I trust the documentation

Mar 08 17:45:31 <mcatanzaro>	OK hi federico1! You are updating openSUSE to 2.14.5....
Mar 08 17:45:37 <federico1>	indeed!
Mar 08 17:45:41 <federico1>	you are saying that fedora has it now?
Mar 08 17:45:56 <federico1>	I may have cloned the wrong repo then
Mar 08 17:46:03 <mcatanzaro>	https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-0beb752b6e <-- Indeed, this is the Fedora update. Ubuntu had it even earlier, they were pretty happy about that. :P
Mar 08 17:48:41 <federico1>	mcatanzaro: thanks!
Mar 08 17:48:46 <federico1>	I'll look how it's done there
Mar 08 17:49:03 <federico1>	(... it builds fine with my setup for gnome 2.22; I just need an RPM to start testing dependencies)
Mar 08 17:49:33 <mcatanzaro>	federico1: Here is the RPM source repo in case it helps: https://src.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/webkitgtk4.git
Mar 08 17:50:15 <mcatanzaro>	BTW we wound up deciding the openSUSE package name was way better than ours... we're not looking forward to GTK+ 4 now. :P
Mar 08 17:51:05 <zaitor>	mcatanzaro: and you yelled at us sooo much for our choice ;-)
Mar 08 17:51:25 <mcatanzaro>	zaitor: Did I? I'm allowed to be dumb sometimes I hope! :(
Mar 08 17:51:31 <federico1>	mcatanzaro: this is not for gtk4, is it?
Mar 08 17:51:40 <mcatanzaro>	Nope, we don't support GTK+ 4 yet at all.
Mar 08 17:52:06 <mcatanzaro>	When we do, I suggest you create a webkit2gtk4 package. And leave us Fedora folks to stew in the package naming mess we've created for ourselves. ;)
Mar 08 17:52:07 <zaitor>	mcatanzaro: yup you did, and yes you are allowed, as we all make mistakes
Mar 08 17:52:19 <federico1>	although we have this confusion of webkitgtk.spec, webkitgtk3.spec
Mar 08 17:52:37 <zaitor>	federico1: that is no confusion at all?
Mar 08 17:52:43 <federico1>	mcatanzaro: just to make sure I'm not messing things up, this version does not have the old API anymore, correct?
Mar 08 17:53:05 <federico1>	zaitor: hello!
Mar 08 17:53:20 <zaitor>	federico1: that is the old branch, webkit 1 for gtk2 and gtk3 - and hi federico1
Mar 08 17:53:42 <zaitor>	we only support gtk3 for webkit2
Mar 08 17:53:56 <mcatanzaro>	federico1: Right. webkit2gtk3 is the modern webkit2gtk-4.0 API. webkitgtk and webkitgtk3 packages are obsolete/insecure/unsupported webkitgtk-1.0 (WebKit1 for GTK+ 2) and webkitgtk-3.0 APIs (WebKit1 for GTK+ 3).
Mar 08 17:54:02 <zaitor>	that is why it's called webkit2gtk3 ;-) small extra stab at mcatanzaro
Mar 08 17:54:10 <mcatanzaro>	:D
Mar 08 17:54:41 <mcatanzaro>	zaitor: We are planning to match our future upstream pkg-config naming with the openSUSE package name. Whenever we get around to adding GTK+ 4 support.
Mar 08 17:55:23 <mcatanzaro>	federicro, zaitor: BTW we are going to be deleting our webkitgtk and webkitgtk3 packages from rawhide next week. I wonder if you're planning to ever do that in openSUSE?
Mar 08 17:55:57 <zaitor>	federico1: for what it's worth, I have tried in the past to bump Leap(sle) to current verison, but I've failed miserably
Mar 08 17:56:12 <mcatanzaro>	Most important apps have been ported already, or will never be ported... OTOH you might want to wait for e.g. GnuCash or maybe Empathy.
Mar 08 17:56:29 <zaitor>	mcatanzaro: I've been silently dropping/porting all "GNOME" apps as far as possible watching your upstream bug
Mar 08 17:56:45 <mcatanzaro>	So I guess the problem with Leap is GCC 4.8 right? Can you try building with clang instead? Or... I hate to say this, but try bundling GCC?
Mar 08 17:56:58 <zaitor>	but we have a LOT of none gnome crap depending on old wekbit1
Mar 08 17:57:23 <zaitor>	so it will take a long time still - but we at least beat you on dropping gstreamer 0_10
Mar 08 17:57:36 <mcatanzaro>	zaitor: Looks like we have 36 packages left: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1375784
Mar 08 17:57:50 <zaitor>	mcatanzaro: i did try with clang, still fail :-(
Mar 08 17:57:52 <mcatanzaro>	WTF, claws-mail? :(
Mar 08 17:58:03 <zaitor>	yuå
Mar 08 17:58:05 <zaitor>	yup
Mar 08 17:58:57 <zaitor>	look at this nightmare https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/gbBfLaZL/
Mar 08 17:59:28 <zaitor>	meson even ;-) - but I guess that should be quite easy to fixup
Mar 08 17:59:35 <mcatanzaro>	erlang and meson depend on WebKit... wow :D
Mar 08 17:59:57 <zaitor>	and we got emacs last year
Mar 08 18:00:14 *	zaitor brings out the whip for emacs upstream
Mar 08 18:00:22 <mcatanzaro>	zaitor: Our emacs maintainer applied an upstream patch a couple weeks ago to avoid this
Mar 08 18:01:09 <zaitor>	me and our emacs maintainer are flat out enemies -- so I'll let someone else sub that patch
Mar 08 18:03:13 <federico1>	zaitor: how can I help you with leap?  it's my fault that I wasn't aware of that update attempt
Mar 08 18:03:19 <zaitor>	but mcatanzaro: seriously - your next fedora target should be to axe gstreamer_010 - heck, we and debian have been able to do it
Mar 08 18:03:22 <federico1>	zaitor: ... to avoid reinventing wheels here :)
Mar 08 18:04:07 <mcatanzaro>	federico1: I guess your biggest problem is going to be the compiler version. Last time I had you guys disable IndexedDB support to avoid a dependency on GCC 4.8. That's not going to be possible anymore, you really need GCC 4.9 now. And Apple wants to bump our dependency to GCC 5 now. So if zaitor is saying he wasn't able to build it with clang either, you're going to either add some newer GCC package for, or build newer GCC as part of y
Mar 08 18:04:09 <mcatanzaro>	our WebKit build, or something.
Mar 08 18:04:13 <zaitor>	federico1: I've never subbed anything, as for Leap it's a SLE thing, I just a halfass attempt that I could use to "shame" you SLE maintainers ;-)
Mar 08 18:04:27 <mcatanzaro>	zaitor: Actually removing gstreamer_010 was discussed recently.
Mar 08 18:04:33 <zaitor>	federico1: I think I've nuked the branch already
Mar 08 18:04:53 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Did we disable GIMP's help browser in Fedora?
Mar 08 18:05:01 <zaitor>	rishi: you did :-)
Mar 08 18:05:16 <rishi>	zaitor: Ok. Good!
Mar 08 18:05:18 <federico1>	zaitor: this is actually for SLE; I wanted to see how far it's in opensuse already :)
Mar 08 18:05:25 *	federico1 is totally new to the webkit universe
Mar 08 18:05:25 <zaitor>	and I followed your lead, or to be correct, you did some workaround
Mar 08 18:05:38 <zaitor>	^  rishi
Mar 08 18:06:18 <zaitor>	federico1: as long as the package is SLE inherited, I can't sub an update/change
Mar 08 18:06:29 <mcatanzaro>	Hey Company, you own the gstreamer-0.10 packages in Fedora. In the mood to retire them...?
Mar 08 18:06:40 <mcatanzaro>	https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/gstreamer
Mar 08 18:07:10 <federico1>	zaitor: checking...
Mar 08 18:07:24 <zaitor>	for the gstreamers, I even nuked banshee from Tumbleweed
Mar 08 18:07:42 <zaitor>	even if we had a halfass port to gst-1.0
Mar 08 18:08:04 <mcatanzaro>	zaitor: banshee has been unmaintained for years, that's no loss. I think we'll lose it next week when we remove WebKit1, actually.
Mar 08 18:08:26 <mcatanzaro>	Company: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/HHPHRNYQJC73ZRDHEO7E7JPR47UQABAV/
Mar 08 18:09:03 <mcatanzaro>	zaitor: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=747030 is my personal favorite! Bets on how long until it gets a response?
Mar 08 18:09:22 <zaitor>	I wish we had a "distro mailinglist" where we could coordinate on droping old obsolete crap
Mar 08 18:09:54 <zaitor>	yeah banshee is dead im afraid
Mar 08 18:10:24 <zaitor>	so good riddance, but it was at one point a "shiny example app" for novell/suse/gnome
Mar 08 18:10:36 <zaitor>	and it was a good app too
Mar 08 18:10:57 <federico1>	zaitor: there's distributor-list@gnome.org
Mar 08 18:11:09 <zaitor>	federico1: yeah but that is gnome centric
Mar 08 18:11:16 <federico1>	zaitor: oh, I see what you mean... leap repos update from sle.  Shit.
Mar 08 18:11:17 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: This might be an example of the WebKit processes crashing in the wild: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777720
Mar 08 18:11:23 <rishi>	Like we discussed some time ago.
Mar 08 18:12:01 <rishi>	Banshee is dead? :(
Mar 08 18:12:24 <rishi>	Did all the Mono applications just die? There was a time when Banshee and Tomboy was where all the cool action was.
Mar 08 18:12:30 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: It looks like probably a WebKit crash, yes. Of course there's nothing we can do without a backtrace.
Mar 08 18:12:54 <zaitor>	federico1: there is a metric ton of libs/apps/frameworks that we carry around just for "other" desktops, not gnome in openSUSE anymore
Mar 08 18:12:56 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: Yes, all Mono applications just died. They have a "preview" version of GTK# for GTK+ 3.0 right now, which is great if you don't need any new widgets since 2011....
Mar 08 18:13:10 <federico1>	zaitor: sigh, yeah :(
Mar 08 18:13:23 <federico1>	zaitor: cargo cult packaging
Mar 08 18:13:31 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: There might be a crash hidden in the Fedora bugzilla.
Mar 08 18:14:10 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: There are so many of these "GOA sucks / doesn't work" bugs that could be for so many different reasons. :)
Mar 08 18:14:16 <zaitor>	federico1: and me as a "community person" are getting a lot of gray hairs from them :)
Mar 08 18:14:42 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: systemd --user, gnome-keyring, webkit, some server-side problem, or an actual bug in gnome-online-accounts.
Mar 08 18:16:40 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777720#c5
Mar 08 18:18:49 <rishi>	Thanks for the comment.
Mar 08 18:23:58 <federico1>	zaitor: mmmm, we have gcc5 available in sle12-sp2
Mar 08 18:24:23 <federico1>	zaitor: do you have your webkit specfiles around?  I could try continuing that
Mar 08 18:24:55 <federico1>	zaitor: can you please remind me of your obs username?
Mar 08 18:24:55 <mcatanzaro>	federico1: With GCC 5, you should have no problem I think. :)
Mar 08 18:25:26 <zaitor>	nope, I've nuked the branch, but you should be able to use the TW spec just fine, with minor modifications
Mar 08 18:25:35 <mcatanzaro>	federico1: https://build.opensuse.org/user/show/Zaitor
Mar 08 18:25:39 <zaitor>	probably need to drop/refresh a few patches
Mar 08 18:25:49 <federico1>	zaitor: cool, thanks
Mar 08 18:26:46 <federico1>	mcatanzaro: goddamnit, I tried zaitor and it turns out users are case sensitive
Mar 08 18:26:48 <federico1>	no wonder
Mar 08 18:27:04 <mcatanzaro>	federico1: OBS is full of wonders.
Mar 08 18:27:25 <zaitor>	federico1: and I regret using capital sooo much
Mar 08 18:28:23 <federico1>	hehe
Mar 09 07:33:05 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos! Can you give me r+ on https://da.gd/v2sd ?
Mar 09 07:42:56 <KaL>	tpopela: if GstClockTime is guint64 I think position should be guint64 too, no?
Mar 09 07:55:29 <tpopela>	KaL, yes, it should be.. I just wanted to stick to the other usages in that function (all use static_cast), but I can change it to guint64 definitely -> it will be more cleaner..
Mar 09 07:59:33 <tpopela>	KaL, meh, it can't be as gst_query_parse_position is expecting gint64 and not guint64 and other gst_* calls as well..
Mar 09 08:00:43 <KaL>	ah, I guess the cast is ok then, maybe zdobersek or someone more familiar with that code could confirm the right approach
Mar 09 08:01:35 <tpopela>	zdobersek, Hi Žan, are you OK with ^ ?
Mar 09 08:04:18 <zdobersek>	looking ...
Mar 09 08:06:21 <zdobersek>	tpopela: looks fine
Mar 09 08:06:47 <tpopela>	zdobersek, ok, I will fill you as reviewer then ;)
Mar 09 08:08:07 <aperezd4>	KaL: when you have time for a quick r+, there this one which mcatanzaro already LGTM'd: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169278
Mar 09 08:44:16 <aperezd4>	\o/ thanks!
Mar 09 08:51:13 <tpopela>	KaL, and another small thing fixing my fault - https://da.gd/r9IDA .. I will add a link to it to the bug where it got introduced..
Mar 09 08:54:33 <KaL>	tpopela: GdkDragAction is a bitmask, no? or is ti a normal enum?
Mar 09 09:11:04 <tpopela>	KaL, ah yes, it is.. I should look more carefully.. then nothing.. and thanks :)
Mar 09 09:11:43 <KaL>	tpopela: but I see GTK+ does == also, I'm confused
Mar 09 09:12:34 <tpopela>	KaL, yes that's exactly where I saw it as well.. (while working on DnD in Evolution)..
Mar 09 09:13:45 <tpopela>	KaL, probably at this point there could be only one action available, that's why == and & works..
Mar 09 09:17:05 <tpopela>	KaL, so for gdk_drag_context_get_selected_action it returns the action and for gdk_drag_context_get_actions it's a bitmask.. _action vs _actions
Mar 09 09:17:25 <KaL>	ah, I see
Mar 09 09:17:29 <KaL>	r=me then
Mar 09 09:18:12 <tpopela>	KaL, thanks!

Mar 09 10:50:23 <tpopela>	KaL, any feedback on https://da.gd/kM4k ? On two places I changed WebKitGTK+ to WebKit to be consistent..
Mar 09 11:18:28 <KaL>	tpopela: wow, did you pass the spellchecker on the code? :-D I haven't reviewed in detail, but feel free to push unreviewed
Mar 09 20:01:20 <isaque[m]>	KaL: hi Carlos, how are you? do you have a minute?
Mar 10 02:13:09 <tpopela>	KaL, yes I do have a spellcheck enabled for comments in vim.. and I was waiting on something to finish so I went through the docs.. Are there any other files apart of these from Source/WebKit2/UIProcess/API/gtk and Source/WebKit2/WebProcess/InjectedBundle/API/gtk from where the docs are generated?
Mar 10 02:13:49 <KaL>	hhmm, nope
Mar 10 02:13:56 <aperezd4>	tpopela: documentation is generated using gtk-doc only, so that's the only place
Mar 10 02:14:23 <tpopela>	aperezd4, ok
Mar 10 02:14:46 <tpopela>	KaL, I'm going to push it then..
Mar 10 02:15:00 <KaL>	perfect, thanks!
Mar 10 02:18:14 <tpopela>	KaL, np :)
Mar 10 08:13:53 <isaque[m]>	KaL: hey man, how are you? I have applied your patches to bibijen in a wip branch (wip/igaldino/webkit2-port) but the editor is behaving weird. Would you mind to check what is missing in that code?
Mar 10 12:46:31 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Still up for WebKit1 killing day next week?
Mar 10 12:49:09 <annulen>	what?
Mar 10 12:50:17 <annulen>	they killed wk1
Mar 10 12:50:31 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: WebKit1 killing day for rawhide!
Mar 10 13:06:03 <federico1>	dunno who cmake'ed webkitgtk, and I thought I was going to hate it, but so far the experience has been super smooth
Mar 10 13:22:46 <mcatanzaro>	federico1: The answer is many people, over a span of about five years... it's better for Web
Mar 10 13:23:09 <mcatanzaro>	for WebKit because Autotools is just not an acceptable build system for Windows or macOS.
Mar 10 13:23:31 <mcatanzaro>	But I don't really like CMake.
Mar 10 18:25:11 <brrian>	it's.. great if you don't need to do complicated things.
Mar 11 00:04:31 <Guest6>	Anybody around that can help figure out a GTK build failure on EWS? https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169486
Mar 11 00:04:39 <bradee-oh>	^^^

Mar 14 08:56:35 <annulen>	thanks!
Mar 14 13:43:36 <federico_>	hmm
Mar 14 13:44:33 <federico_>	have evolution / empathy / gimp been ported to the new webkitgtk?
Mar 14 13:44:50 <mcatanzaro>	federico_: yes / kinda / kinda
Mar 14 13:44:54 <mcatanzaro>	Evolution: yes
Mar 14 13:45:08 <mcatanzaro>	Empathy: Only in git, there is no release yet. Needs a small amount of work.
Mar 14 13:45:26 <mcatanzaro>	GIMP: No, but WebKit is only needed for the built-in documentation browser and there is a configure flag to disable it.
Mar 14 13:47:01 <federico_>	mcatanzaro: great, thanks
Mar 14 13:47:08 <federico_>	if all goes well, I'll be able to update SLE soon
Mar 14 13:47:15 <mcatanzaro>	\o/
Mar 14 13:47:30 <federico_>	I have a working package of 2.14.5, at least for the packages that depend on webkit2gtk3
Mar 14 13:48:36 <federico_>	mcatanzaro: I guess I should talk to the empathy people (anyone left there?) about the missing work?
Mar 14 13:48:55 <mcatanzaro>	federico_: Nobody left there.
Mar 14 13:49:09 <federico_>	shit :)
Mar 14 13:49:09 <mcatanzaro>	Missing work is just fixing a few criticals
Mar 14 13:49:32 <federico_>	mcatanzaro: ok, I'll trawl bugzilla
Mar 14 13:50:16 <mcatanzaro>	Bugzilla is a landfill, feel free to push directly if you have a patch that fixes something
Mar 14 13:50:36 <mcatanzaro>	Also we need to figure out how to fix distcheck
Mar 14 13:53:33 <zaitor>	federico_: in openSUSE we are already running empathy webkit1 free
Mar 14 13:53:43 <zaitor>	(tw that is)
Mar 14 13:53:47 <mcatanzaro>	:O
Mar 14 13:53:59 <mcatanzaro>	zaitor: I guess we should use whatever patch you're using in Fedora too
Mar 14 13:54:13 <mcatanzaro>	We retired webkit1 earlier today, empathy is surely broken now
Mar 14 13:54:20 <zaitor>	mcatanzaro: pretty sure I got it from bugzilla or git
Mar 14 13:54:36 <mcatanzaro>	It's half-baked in either case, but better than no empathy
Mar 14 13:54:49 <zaitor>	disclaimer: I don't use empathy, but we have had zero complaints, so if its broken for us too, we have no users left
Mar 14 13:55:14 <zaitor>	https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/GNOME:Next/empathy/empathy-port-webkit2gkt3.patch?expand=1
Mar 14 13:56:00 <mcatanzaro>	Hey rishi, do you want to save our empathy package with that patch, or do you want me to do it? ^
Mar 14 13:56:10 <mcatanzaro>	It's needed in rawhide only
Mar 14 13:57:05 <zaitor>	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=749001
Mar 14 13:58:45 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: Also you forgot to delete the .patch files from git
Mar 14 14:00:34 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Hey!
Mar 14 14:01:58 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Sure, if you think it works, or is better than the current situation, then why not?
Mar 14 14:02:08 <rishi>	How about making a new release from master?
Mar 14 14:02:20 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: I am currently working on https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1381671 :)
Mar 14 14:02:29 <rishi>	Eek! (re: the left over patches)
Mar 14 14:02:54 <rishi>	I always wondered how people managed to leave unused patches in the tree. Now I know. :/
Mar 14 14:05:03 <hussam>	isn't that a telepathy-gabble/wocky issue?
Mar 14 14:05:08 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: Oh gosh, that's a nasty issue
Mar 14 14:05:49 <mcatanzaro>	I think hussam is right?
Mar 14 14:06:15 <rishi>	hussam: mcatanzaro: Maybe. Maybe not. We'll see. :)
Mar 14 14:08:45 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: As for an upstream release... I think we need to figure out how to fix distcheck
Mar 14 14:09:56 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: For such weird upstreams, my bar is "does it build for my favourite distribution" ? :)
Mar 14 14:27:01 <federico_>	zaitor: thanks; I may backport some stuff, then!
Mar 14 14:27:49 <zaitor>	federico_: there are 2 patches in there - but note that bringing evolution up to speed in sle and leap will be a major bump
Mar 14 14:28:27 <zaitor>	I have no expectation of dropping webkit1 in opensuse any time soon
Mar 14 14:28:39 <mcatanzaro>	We did it! \o/
Mar 14 14:28:45 <mcatanzaro>	I'm still in shock
Mar 14 14:28:58 *	mcatanzaro waits for complaints to begin
Mar 14 16:48:51 <federico_>	mcatanzaro: do you know which version of evolution introduced the port to webkit2?
Mar 14 16:50:02 <federico_>	3.21.something?  I guess 3.20 still uses the old api?
Mar 14 16:56:18 <federico_>	found it
Mar 14 16:56:21 <federico_>	3.21.90
Mar 14 17:43:02 <zaitor>	federico_: btw, for gimp, we have already done the disable internal-help-browers disable thing (for tw only)
Mar 14 17:43:26 <federico_>	zaitor: thanks, I'll pull that into sle
Mar 14 17:43:45 <federico_>	currently trying evo 3.22 to see if it works
Mar 14 17:44:15 <zaitor>	federico_: you know you have to push all these changes to leap too right :-)
Mar 14 17:47:50 <federico_>	zaitor: yeah - I guess I should have started there?  I don't have a leap VM right now, only SLE ones :)
Mar 14 17:49:14 <zaitor>	federico_: in theory, if it works in SLE it should work fine in leap too
Mar 14 17:50:04 <zaitor>	and no, you should not start in Leap, as leap inherits the sle updates
Mar 15 11:38:53 <lufimtse>	Quick question: If I create a webview like: webkit_web_view_new (), do I then destroy it via gtk_widget_destroy()?
Mar 15 11:39:59 <mcatanzaro>	lufimtse: Not usually. If you're adding it to a window then it will be destroyed when the parent widget is destroyed. Normally you don't destroy widgets manually unless you want it to die before its parent.
Mar 15 11:40:19 <MonkeyofDoom>	webviews are like other widgets in that they start with a floating reference, right?
Mar 15 11:40:20 <lufimtse>	mcatanzaro, ah, I see. Thank you for clarification. 
Mar 15 11:41:02 <mcatanzaro>	lufimtse: If you're writing a scraper or something and not showing a window or adding it to a GTK+ widget hierarchy at all, then I still wouldn't bother with gtk_widget_destroy(), I would use g_object_ref_sink() and g_object_unref(). I think it gets destroyed automatically when the last reference is dropped.
Mar 15 11:41:26 <mcatanzaro>	MonkeyofDoom: Yes, all GtkWidgets start with a floating reference that gets sunk when added to a parent widget.

Mar 16 14:33:04 <yusukesuzuki>	hey, are WebKitGTK+ folks around?
Mar 16 14:34:01 <MonkeyofDoom>	just ask what you'd ask if they were
Mar 16 14:34:10 <MonkeyofDoom>	:)
Mar 16 14:35:09 <yusukesuzuki>	JSC folks currently encounter the platform-specific issues on Wasm. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169611
Mar 16 14:36:24 <yusukesuzuki>	This optimization relies on Darwin system-reserved TLS, which is never available in Linux. So while we would like to enable it on Darwin platform, we would like to explore the way to implement it/offer a fallback to it in Linux.
Mar 16 16:58:00 <lufimtse>	Question: As a Webkit2Gtk user, It seems I call JavaScriptCore functions (ex JSValueToNumber). In general, can I call all public JavaScriptCore methods, or are the limits on what I can call? Is it even safe to call JavascriptCore when using webkit2?
Mar 16 16:58:06 <lufimtse>	Any docu on the above?
Mar 16 17:00:02 <lufimtse>	Hmm, in webkit_web_view_run_javascript_finish() it shows that javascript core functions are used. So it seems that it is somewhat safe to call them?
Mar 16 18:07:56 <lufimtse>	------
Mar 16 18:08:19 <lufimtse>	if we run webkit_web_view_try_close(), there is no way to tell if user cancled page load.
Mar 16 18:08:26 <lufimtse>	i.e, no signal or anything like that.
Mar 16 18:08:32 <lufimtse>	is there any way around that?

Mar 17 05:44:39 <aperezdc_>	\o/
Mar 17 05:44:55 <aperezdc_>	yaneti: yes, it has been working better for me too with big animated GIFs
Mar 17 11:35:01 <mcatanzaro>	So mclasen, we switched WebKit trunk over to using GtkFileChooserNative last week. And Epiphany too. Thanks to aperezdc__. :)
Mar 17 11:35:17 <mcatanzaro>	You were asking if we could do the same for WebKitPrintOperation. I dunno, I'm not familiar with it.
Mar 17 11:35:47 <mclasen>	pretty cool, thanks for doing that
Mar 17 11:35:48 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela or KaL might have an idea. My worry is that we have API to allow modifying the dialog, so I kinda suspect it won't be possible to support that API via a portal.
Mar 17 11:36:00 <mclasen>	I discovered the printoperation thing when I was making yelp run inside a sandbox
Mar 17 11:36:05 <mcatanzaro>	We could deprecate the API, but I think Evolution is using it.
Mar 17 11:36:25 <mclasen>	ironically, print-to-file works, because you do get the file chooser portal for selecting the file
Mar 17 11:36:31 <mcatanzaro>	So I'd like to hear from the people using WebKitPrintOperation already (tpopela?).
Mar 17 11:37:00 <mcatanzaro>	mclasen: Interesting, if you got the file chooser portal you must be using really recent WebKit I think!
Mar 17 11:38:04 <mclasen>	could well be
Mar 17 11:41:41 <aperezdc_>	yep, using GtkFileChooserNative had a bit of gotchas to get it done, but nothing dramatic, and only had the cost of losing the preview pane in the Open/Save dialog in Ephy, which is okay
Mar 17 11:42:00 <aperezdc_>	but I have no idea what it would entail to make printing work
Mar 17 11:42:09 *	aperezdc_  checks the docs
Mar 17 11:43:23 <mcatanzaro>	Also: we had no WebKit API to customize the file chooser. Just a signal to allow the application to show its own custom file chooser if it wanted. But I don't think that's how the printing API works.
Mar 17 11:43:26 <mclasen>	aperezdc_: I think I made the portal show a preview on its own now, for image types
Mar 17 11:44:01 <aperezdc_>	mclasen: oh, that's sweet, I think it's exactly the case in which the preview widget would show :)
Mar 17 11:45:47 <aperezdc_>	mcatanzaro: I see no way of customizing WebKitPrintOperation (I am checking Source/WebKit2/UIProcess/API/gtk/WebKitPrintOperation.h )
Mar 17 11:46:12 <aperezdc_>	ouch, there's a ::create-custom-widget signal
Mar 17 11:46:59 <aperezdc_>	JFTR, Epiphany does not use that
Mar 17 11:46:59 <mcatanzaro>	Well we could probably use the portal if the user does not create a custom widget, right?
Mar 17 11:47:20 <aperezdc_>	mcatanzaro: that can be one way to go about it
Mar 17 11:47:34 <mclasen>	yeah, the embedding of custom widgetry is generally what we loose by moving to out-of-process portal solutions
Mar 17 11:47:37 <mcatanzaro>	That would fix Yelp and Epiphany. And then Evolution would just have to choose between its custom widget and functional printing inside flatpak.
Mar 17 11:48:27 <aperezdc_>	also, WebKitGTK+ is not using GtkPrintOperation, it goes directly with gtk_print_unix_*
Mar 17 11:48:58 <mclasen>	so no printing from webkit on windows ? or does it do its own thing there ?
Mar 17 11:49:20 <mcatanzaro>	mclasen: WebKitGTK+ doesn't support Windows anymore, so no need to worry about it.
Mar 17 11:49:24 <aperezdc_>	// TODO: We need to add an implementation for Windows.
Mar 17 11:49:33 <aperezdc_>	↑↑ as per the source
Mar 17 11:49:35 *	mclasen wasn't worried
Mar 17 11:49:37 <mclasen>	just curious
Mar 17 11:51:51 <aperezdc_>	GtkPrintOperation seems to have most (if not all) of the API that WebKitGTK+ uses from GtkPrintUnixDialog
Mar 17 11:52:04 <aperezdc_>	maybe I'll take a stab at it, but not this week
Mar 17 11:56:41 <mclasen>	cool, thanks!

Mar 20 14:54:09 <puregreen>	Is there a way to enable SelectionPaintingWithoutSelectionGaps in WebKitGTK+? I'm talking about this: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156900
Mar 20 14:55:10 <puregreen>	(this setting is supposed to disable “blocky” selection)
Mar 20 15:39:01 <puregreen>	Also, what is the difference between WebKitSettings and WKPreferences in general and how can I change settings from the latter?
Mar 21 03:21:27 <hussam>	is the cactus doodle https://google.com/ playing too fast for anyone else?
Mar 21 03:32:55 <hussam>	https://www.google.com.lb/logos/doodles/2017/mothers-day-2017-mena-5190315458691072-hp.gif it plays too fast the first time. it slows down to normal speed on reload.
Mar 21 04:35:47 <tpopela>	berto, Hi Berto! Did you tried to build 2.16 on armv7?
Mar 21 04:46:42 <berto>	tpopela: I'm having problems building 2.16 with the latest gcc
Mar 21 04:47:04 <tpopela>	berto, gcc7? No problems here..
Mar 21 04:47:30 <berto>	no, gcc 6
Mar 21 04:47:35 <tpopela>	berto, I do have problems with newest gobject-introspection (at least I have to confirm it, but it will take ages)..
Mar 21 04:47:45 <berto>	tpopela: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=858261
Mar 21 04:47:58 <berto>	but 2.15.92 (which is essentially the same) builds in all arches I think
Mar 21 04:48:12 <tpopela>	berto, I'm using gcc 6 every day here to build WK..
Mar 21 04:48:18 <berto>	https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=webkit2gtk&suite=experimental
Mar 21 04:48:43 <berto>	yeah me too, I guess there was some regression in one of the latests debian updates
Mar 21 04:48:46 <berto>	I don't know
Mar 21 04:48:48 <berto>	I haven't looked into it yet
Mar 21 04:49:01 <tpopela>	berto, yes here is the same, but on rawhide it fails (that one is having newer gobject-introspection) - https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/getfile?taskID=18489024&name=build.log&offset=-2000000 look for "8241"
Mar 21 04:49:37 <berto>	I see
Mar 21 04:50:01 <tpopela>	berto, hmm gcc crashing for you.. nice :D
Mar 21 06:24:21 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos, when 2.16 is out can you briefly look at https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79226 ?
Mar 21 12:42:10 <hussam>	is https://bugs.webkit.org down?
Mar 21 12:43:03 <magomez>	hussam yes, planned upgrade
Mar 21 12:43:15 <hussam>	magomez: ok, thank you.
Mar 21 14:34:18 <mdemi>	Hi -- I wonder if in webkit2gtk there's a way to have the equivalent of what I can do with ::policy-decision for individual resources (e.g., block individual javascript) without resorting to WebExtensions.  If, say, ::resource-load would let me do some magic in the argument request...?
Mar 21 17:14:15 <bitlord>	anyone successfully using distcc to compile ~latest webkitgtk (~2.14.x)?
Mar 21 17:43:27 <aperezdc_>	bitlord: we usually pick icecc for builds (in particular when developing to make debug builds), I think nobody has used distcc for a long while
Mar 21 17:44:27 <aperezdc_>	It should work though, it should be particularly easy if you combine it with ccache and set CCACHE_PREFIX=distcc in the environment before building
Mar 22 00:28:19 <bitlord>	Thank you aperezdc_, I'm not using this for development, just to build a package, I guess portage by default swaps cc (or whatever with distcc (how not yet sure, but it works for a lot of packages)), with webkitgtk it mostly fails to distribute compilation and falls back to build locally
Mar 23 07:35:10 <hussam>	when loading a youtube video, parts of the page such as the images on the right of other videos don't start loading until all the currently playing video is buffered.
Mar 23 07:35:53 <hussam>	is that intentional?
Mar 23 07:36:19 <mcatanzaro>	hussam: I think it's a bug, but I don't know if it's a YouTube bug or a WebKit bug.
Mar 23 07:41:33 <hussam>	mcatanzaro: ok, thank you.
Mar 23 07:55:23 <hussam>	mcatanzaro: it's also hanging when I try to seek if the video already finished playing. gdb says /usr/lib/libgstreamer-1.0.so.0
Mar 23 07:56:09 <mcatanzaro>	Oh no :(
Mar 23 07:56:30 <mcatanzaro>	Can you report it on WebKit Bugzilla? If it turns out to be a GStreamer bug we can always move it to GNOME Bugzilla later.
Mar 23 07:56:40 <mcatanzaro>	Use [GStreamer] rather than [GTK] in the bug title.
Mar 23 07:57:05 <hussam>	Ok, I'll need to recompile gstreamer first for debug information.
Mar 23 08:04:25 <mcatanzaro>	Yes indeed, thanks
Mar 23 08:35:19 <hussam>	does debug webkit still break evolution?
Mar 23 08:35:52 <mcatanzaro>	I did not realize it ever did.
Mar 23 08:37:51 <hussam>	I may or may not have filed a bug about it in gnome bug tracker. I'll ask mcrha.
Mar 23 09:07:00 <hussam>	mcatanzaro: looks like my memory is wrong. it broke gdb at some point:  mcrha> hi hussam, debug webkit, like webkit compiled with debug symbols? It breaks gdb, not evolution itself, due to "too long symbol names", or something like that
Mar 23 09:10:49 <mcatanzaro>	It was a gdb crash
Mar 23 09:10:52 <mcatanzaro>	It's fixed upstream
Mar 23 09:11:07 <mcatanzaro>	gdb works fine if you just ignore it, it's only a demangler crash
Mar 23 09:11:18 <hussam>	ok. thank you.
Mar 23 09:26:04 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, Hi Michael! can you try something? Can you write 's' in the Google Docs's Sheet?
Mar 23 09:36:44 <hussam>	mcatanzaro: it's not compiling https://paste.gnome.org/peprvjwv5/9hax7c/raw
Mar 23 10:04:58 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: No, there is a bug for it somewhere
Mar 23 10:05:07 <mcatanzaro>	Something changed on Google's end, I think
Mar 23 10:05:36 <mcatanzaro>	hussam: It looks familiar....
Mar 23 10:06:09 <hussam>	mcatanzaro: I'm trying RelWithDebInfo now instead.
Mar 23 10:06:17 <mcatanzaro>	hussam: That's broken, don't!
Mar 23 10:06:26 <hussam>	ok
Mar 23 10:39:31 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, ok :)
Mar 23 11:01:39 <hussam>	mcatanzaro: adding unset CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS bypassed that error with cmake build type Debug.
Mar 23 11:30:17 <KaL>	danw: so, no libsoup release for gnome 3.24? :-( is there anything blocking a release or just a matter of lack of time?
Mar 23 11:30:46 <danw>	KaL: just lack of time. if you'd like to do a release you can
Mar 23 11:31:10 <KaL>	danw: that was my next question, If I could help with that somehow
Mar 23 11:31:21 <mcatanzaro>	We have unreviewed patches that are important too.
Mar 23 11:31:23 <danw>	want to become the libsoup maintainer? :)
Mar 23 11:31:24 <mcatanzaro>	To libsoup
Mar 23 11:31:58 <KaL>	daniels: not that I want :-) because I'm already in charge of too many things, but I can help for sure
Mar 23 11:32:04 <danw>	yes, actually, that's really why i haven't done a release. doing a release is easy, but there's no real point in putting a new release out if i haven't gotten any new patches in
Mar 23 11:32:18 <KaL>	oops, I meant danw, sorry daniels
Mar 23 11:32:40 <KaL>	well, there are also important patches that landed
Mar 23 12:31:08 <hussam>	mcatanzaro: https://paste.gnome.org/puo7jwahg/wrl6zh/raw this is what happens when I use evolution with debug webkit.
Mar 23 12:44:17 <mcatanzaro>	hussam: That's bad!
Mar 23 12:44:51 <mcatanzaro>	Evolution devs ought to test with debug builds to make sure they're not missing assertion failures (tpopela ;)
Mar 23 12:44:56 <hussam>	mcatanzaro: milan just pointed me to this: https://bugs.webkit.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=WebPage%3A%3Areload&list_id=2602909
Mar 23 12:45:14 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, no way :) you can do it :)
Mar 23 12:45:30 <mcatanzaro>	Might be https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169894?
Mar 23 12:45:35 <mcatanzaro>	If so, good timing
Mar 23 12:46:04 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, btw there is a regression in 2.16 that's causing Evo to misbehave.. but it's only if you have HTML mode enabled in composer.. and you want to change the font color..
Mar 23 13:01:34 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, and also Epi is crashing for me, when holding a mouse on the back button..
Mar 23 13:01:44 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Bug reports please :)
Mar 23 13:02:50 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, tomorrow :)..
Mar 23 13:03:08 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, and for the WebKit one, I'm bisecting right now..
Mar 23 14:31:14 <grim>	hiya, i was in here awhile ago about looking to move from webkit1gtk to webkit2gtk but was basically blocked by the lack of a build/support on windows, just wondering if there's any support for windows now or if anyone knows if anyone is working on it, etc
Mar 23 14:33:05 <mcatanzaro>	grim: No, there is no Windows support and most likely never will be
Mar 23 14:33:29 <mcatanzaro>	You should look into using either the WinCairo port of WebKit or Chromium.
Mar 23 14:33:44 <grim>	i really don't want to put CEF into pidgin :)
Mar 23 14:33:49 <mcatanzaro>	Or developing and maintaining WebKitGTK+ for Windows, but that'd be a big task.
Mar 23 14:34:04 <aperezdc_>	or, you may contribute the needed code for WebKit2GTK+ in Windows, or get someone to contribute it
Mar 23 14:34:06 <mcatanzaro>	OK pidgin... well I'd recommend not using a web engine at all for that.
Mar 23 14:34:08 <MonkeyofDoom>	does WinCairo even have sandboxing/multiprocess?
Mar 23 14:34:16 <aperezdc_>	ah, mcatanzaro was faster suggesting :D
Mar 23 14:34:28 <mcatanzaro>	MonkeyofDoom: Nope
Mar 23 14:34:44 <mcatanzaro>	MonkeyofDoom: WebKitGTK+ has multiprocess but no sandboxing, FYI
Mar 23 14:34:49 <mcatanzaro>	But I doubt either is important to Pidgin
Mar 23 14:35:33 <grim>	yeah we just need some animations and some basic javascript to bring the ui up to date with like slack, hipchat, etc (ie collapse images, etc)
Mar 23 14:35:46 <mcatanzaro>	grim: Here is my confusion: I filed bugs against all packages in Fedora that were still using WebKit1 before we removed the WebKit1 package. But I don't remember ever filing a bug against Pidgin.
Mar 23 14:35:49 <grim>	i've been looking at https://github.com/litehtml/litehtml but no javascript there :-/
Mar 23 14:36:09 <grim>	mcatanzaro: it's in our forever not released 3.0.0 branch :)
Mar 23 14:36:11 <mcatanzaro>	grim: OK, you do want either WebKit or Chromium in that case.
Mar 23 14:36:31 <mcatanzaro>	But not WebKitGTK+
Mar 23 14:36:47 <grim>	mcatanzaro: yeah, but because of ethics i refuse to touch windows directly... so stuck :-/
Mar 23 14:36:50 <mcatanzaro>	(Unless you have $$$$$ to spend for someone to maintain Windows support)
Mar 23 14:36:54 <grim>	nope
Mar 23 14:37:15 <mcatanzaro>	FWIW: I suspect that very few people use Pidgin on Windows
Mar 23 14:37:20 <mcatanzaro>	But whatever
Mar 23 14:37:24 <grim>	i don't suppose i can just give the wincairo port a cairo context? i mean if it were that easy wouldn't webkitgtk just do that?
Mar 23 14:37:39 <mcatanzaro>	I have no clue how WinCairo works.
Mar 23 14:37:45 <grim>	mcatanzaro: heh you're basing that on what? :P
Mar 23 14:38:00 <mcatanzaro>	WebKitGTK+ is WebKit2-only and WebKit2 has no Windows support. WinCairo is WebKit1-only. So that's one big difference.
Mar 23 14:38:15 <grim>	le sigh
Mar 23 14:39:05 <grim>	alright, so state is the same... damn
Mar 23 14:39:14 <mcatanzaro>	Also I think nobody is taking care of security support for WinCairo. That would be a much easier task than maintaining WebKitGTK+ on Windows, though. You'd probably only need a couple of days every month or two to backport security fixes.
Mar 23 14:39:26 <grim>	maybe CEF is the easier way... but that looked like such a pain to integrate last time i looked it
Mar 23 14:40:15 <grim>	heh sure, but i don't want to carry webkit1 code and webkit2 code, going to make debugging a real pain :)
Mar 23 14:40:26 <grim>	not to mention maintenance
Mar 23 14:40:30 <aperezdc_>	CEF's API is indeed much more complex, I have to agree with that
Mar 23 14:40:42 <aperezdc_>	grim: can't you just disable using a web engine in Windows?
Mar 23 14:41:07 <grim>	aperezdc_: in our dev branch we ripped out the old conversation widget and replaced it with webkit...
Mar 23 14:41:23 <grim>	the widget we ripped out is like box of spiders all the way through infinity
Mar 23 14:41:45 <grim>	we built our own wysiwyg and html display on top of GtkTextView
Mar 23 14:42:04 <aperezdc_>	I see... and JS is a must, isn't it?
Mar 23 14:42:23 <grim>	if we want to look/act/feel like the current state of messaging, yes unfortunately
Mar 23 14:43:19 <aperezdc_>	I was thinking GtkHTML, but if you need JS, it's a no-go
Mar 23 14:43:45 <grim>	yeah, don't need much js, but yeah :-/
Mar 23 14:45:54 <grim>	wait, does CEF use gtk? for some reason i guess i just assumed it didn't..
Mar 23 14:46:14 <MonkeyofDoom>	it doesn't
Mar 23 14:47:31 <grim>	ah ok, but there's a bunch of examples showing how to use it via gtk.. so that _might_ work for me
Mar 23 14:47:38 <grim>	i just don't want to carry it
Mar 23 14:51:17 <aperezdc_>	grim: it's also possible to embed ActiveX controls in GTK+ applications, and Microsoft's web engine is one
Mar 23 14:51:47 <grim>	heh that could be an option, but i'd really like to keep it to a single engine ;)
Mar 23 14:52:07 <aperezdc_>	just in case you want to check it out, here's some example code with Python: http://python.6.x6.nabble.com/Embedding-a-Win32-window-or-ActiveX-control-in-a-pygtk-application-td1938880.html
Mar 23 14:52:57 <aperezdc_>	but I haven't much of an idea about Windows programming, so I don't know how one would go about the details -- I just happened to read something a while ago
Mar 23 14:53:28 <grim>	heh fair enough, thanks for the pointers :)
Mar 23 14:59:21 <aperezdc_>	happy to help!
Mar 23 14:59:45 <aperezdc_>	ideally we would prefer to be able to recommend also using WebKit2GTK+ in Windows, but we are not there yet :-\
Mar 23 15:00:00 <aperezdc_>	(it's unlikely we would be there anytime soon anyway, so...)
Mar 23 15:00:11 <grim>	yeah, i'd much rather not have to carry CEF, but we're strapped when it comes to devs too, so not much we can do to help each other :-/
Mar 23 15:03:46 <grim>	is there a list of tickets or anything that needs to be done to get webkit2gtk+ working on windows?
Mar 23 15:06:07 <aperezdc_>	grim: I think the closest thing would be https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137488
Mar 23 15:06:55 <aperezdc_>	there's even proposed patches from 2015, but likely they have not aged well
Mar 23 15:07:12 <aperezdc_>	and that was just trying to make it build
Mar 23 15:07:38 *	aperezdc_ has to go, bbl
Mar 23 15:07:44 <grim>	later, thanks again!
Mar 23 15:10:17 <mcatanzaro>	grim: You're going to need to implement CoreIPC (WebKit2 API layer) using Windows APIs
Mar 23 15:10:39 <grim>	s/you're/someone/ but cool
Mar 23 15:10:55 <grim>	going to see if i can suggest it as a project to anyone looking for something ;)
Mar 23 15:12:12 <grim>	mcatanzaro: is that the main issue? rendering is handled by gtk i assume then?
Mar 23 15:12:34 <mcatanzaro>	grim: There's probably many issues. I have no clue. Making a web engine work on a new platform is a lot of work.
Mar 23 15:12:51 <grim>	naturally, but is that the main known issue i guess is what i'm asking
Mar 23 15:13:48 <grim>	different question, aside for windows knowledgeable developers, why wasn't it ported? (not looking to place blame, just trying to understand) :-D
Mar 23 15:14:02 <mcatanzaro>	There are no Windows developers working on WebKitGTK+
Mar 23 15:14:22 <grim>	heh ok, but there were for webkit1gtk?
Mar 23 15:14:24 <mcatanzaro>	Actually there was Windows support originally for WebKit2, but it was removed when Apple gave up on Safari for Windows
Mar 23 15:14:33 <mcatanzaro>	I don't remember that far back. :)
Mar 23 15:14:39 <grim>	ok fair enough :)
Mar 23 17:54:39 <aperezdc_>	mcatanzaro: question → would it make sense to provide a notifications implementation using GNotification if a recent-enough GLib version is installed, instead of using libnotify? (and using libnotify for older systems where GLib does not have GNotification)
Mar 23 18:42:03 <mcatanzaro>	aperezdc_: I don't think so. GNotification only works if the application supports D-Bus activation, and there's no way for WebKit to know that.
Mar 23 18:42:58 <mcatanzaro>	Now, it definitely makes sense for *Epiphany* to become D-Bus activatable and then override WebKit's libnotify use with GNotification. (Epiphany should also stop using libnotify itself. It uses it to notify about newly-created web apps.)
Mar 23 18:46:31 <aperezdc_>	mcatanzaro: ah, good point there... I assume then that libnotify is not agoing away anytime soon
Mar 23 18:47:11 <mcatanzaro>	libnotify is dead and should not be used.
Mar 23 18:47:14 <mcatanzaro>	Oh well. :P
Mar 23 18:47:51 <aperezdc_>	ouch... isn't it then a bit of an oversight that GNotification requires D-Bus activation?
Mar 23 18:47:53 <aperezdc_>	O:-)
Mar 23 18:48:09 <aperezdc_>	mcatanzaro: anyway... do we have a ticket in BGO for the task of making Ephy use GNotification?
Mar 23 18:48:17 <aperezdc_>	ah, I'll just search for it
Mar 23 18:48:20 <mcatanzaro>	No, it's a feature. The point of GNotification is for clicking the notification to launch the app if the app is not open.
Mar 23 18:48:28 <mcatanzaro>	I don't know if we have a ticket.
Mar 23 18:48:50 <mcatanzaro>	But we do have https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=722142
Mar 23 18:59:58 <aperezdc_>	ah, that one I found
Mar 23 19:00:25 <aperezdc_>	shall we open a new onein general for GNotification and make it depend on that one?
Mar 23 19:00:59 <mcatanzaro>	There doesn't have to be a dependency. We can do download notifications with libnotify.
Mar 23 19:02:02 <aperezdc_>	true
Mar 24 01:01:23 <grim>	so following up from earlier discussion, i can't use cef either... 547mb .so file... wtf.. that's insane, even more so since it's not in debian at the very least
Mar 24 01:38:57 <fujihiro>	grim:  Otter Browser has up-to-date Windows version. I think QtWebKit supports Windows.
Mar 24 01:47:56 <grim>	fujihiro: i dont' want to mix gtk with qt ;)
Mar 24 01:54:53 <hussam>	do you really need javascript for an instant messenger?
Mar 24 01:56:14 <hussam>	otherwise there is gtkhtml. old evolution used it.
Mar 24 01:56:16 <grim>	hussam: to stay revelant, yes.  i need to be able to display images with the ability to hide them, handle oauth, and people do like shiny interactive backgrounds and stuff
Mar 24 01:57:23 <grim>	i mean i could probably do it with gtkhtml (does it have an editing mode?) but then i have to use something to make stuff controllable, and some times that'll be from a theme, so mixing in native code is probably a no go
Mar 24 02:01:47 <hussam>	oauth wasn't a thing back then.
Mar 24 02:01:57 <grim>	yeah i know :)
Mar 24 02:02:21 <grim>	people are spreading fud about the way oauth was handled for the hangouts plugins for pidgin :-/
Mar 24 02:02:38 <grim>	and it's done that way because we don't have a capable webview :-/
Mar 24 12:23:10 <tsahyt>	Hello! Is this the right channel to ask a question about using webkitgtk?
Mar 24 12:28:01 <KaL>	tsahyt: yes
Mar 24 12:29:36 <tsahyt>	good. I'm writing a small documentation browser, which jumps to URIs with some fragment attached, e.g. example.com/#foo. when using webkit_web_view_load_uri with this URI, it loads the page, but doesn't jump to the anchor. how would I go about getting the desired behavior?
Mar 24 12:30:25 <tsahyt>	it works just fine when clicking a link in the webview that links to some anchor
Mar 24 12:31:12 <KaL>	tsahyt: what webkitgtk version?
Mar 24 12:31:45 <tsahyt>	webkit2. I've also tried with the deprecated API, with the same results
Mar 24 12:31:54 <tsahyt>	let me see which version of the library I have installed locally
Mar 24 12:31:59 <KaL>	I remember an old bug where something like that happened
Mar 24 12:33:27 <tsahyt>	it's linked against the .so provided by webkitgtk4-2.14.1-2.fc25.i686
Mar 24 12:33:44 <KaL>	2.14
Mar 24 12:34:33 <KaL>	have you tried doing the same in MiniBrowser?
Mar 24 12:34:37 <tsahyt>	actually not i686, I miscopied that. but yeah that's the version
Mar 24 12:34:40 <tsahyt>	what's MiniBrowser?
Mar 24 12:35:30 <KaL>	the webkitgtk demo browsers that comes with webkitgtk
Mar 24 12:35:37 <KaL>	I don't know where fedora installs it
Mar 24 12:35:54 <tsahyt>	I'd have to check that. I've noticed that the same happens when I open qutebrowser with the URI directly
Mar 24 12:35:56 <KaL>	just try to load something like https://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/references.html#refsDOMCORE for example and see if it jumps to the anchor
Mar 24 12:35:59 <KaL>	it works here
Mar 24 12:36:00 <tsahyt>	which also uses webkit
Mar 24 12:36:07 <tsahyt>	although not webkitgtk
Mar 24 12:45:43 <tsahyt>	well, I can't find any fedora builds for minibrowser. I suppose I'll have to build it myself then.
Mar 24 12:46:21 <KaL>	MiniBrowser is included in the webkitgtk package
Mar 24 12:46:54 <KaL>	in debian it's installed in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/webkit2gtk-4.0/MiniBrowser
Mar 24 12:47:31 <KaL>	are you sure it's 2.14 and not 2.4? you said you tried the deprecated API which is not available in 2.14
Mar 24 12:47:54 <KaL>	old versions didn't install the MiniBrowser
Mar 24 12:48:04 <tsahyt>	I used webkit1 earlier
Mar 24 12:48:17 <tsahyt>	I have found MiniBrowser now. The link you mentioned works
Mar 24 12:48:21 <tsahyt>	I'll try the same link with my code then
Mar 24 12:51:45 <tsahyt>	hmm okay this is somewhat confusing now. it works just fine.
Mar 24 12:53:23 <tsahyt>	this on the other hand does not. /usr/libexec/webkit2gtk-4.0/MiniBrowser "https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring/docs/Data-ByteString.html#v:map"
Mar 24 12:54:34 <tsahyt>	I'm getting the feeling that his might not be webkit related at all then
Mar 24 12:55:02 <tsahyt>	the inter-page links are slightly different, e.g. https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring-0.10.8.1/docs/Data-ByteString.html#v:map.
Mar 24 12:55:09 <KaL>	tsahyt: file a bug report, please
Mar 24 12:55:54 <KaL>	I guess it's because of the ':' in the fragment
Mar 24 12:56:00 <tsahyt>	I think it's because of the redirect
Mar 24 12:56:31 <tsahyt>	passing the redirected url to MiniBrowser with the fragment works.
Mar 24 12:57:30 <tsahyt>	this might be relevant https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24175
Mar 24 12:58:22 <tsahyt>	KaL: since bug reports for what seems to be the same problem already exist with webkit, should I still report it for webkitgtk?
Mar 24 13:05:13 <KaL>	tsahyt: aha, could be the redirection
Mar 24 13:09:16 <tsahyt>	in my case I can use URLs that are not going to result in a redirect. in the general case however that's not much help I suppse.
Mar 24 13:14:44 <KaL>	tsahyt: please don't workaround it, if there's a bug report it and we will try to fix it
Mar 24 13:15:51 <tsahyt>	KaL: since I don't know nearly enough about the specification of any of this, *should* fragments even be preserved through a redirect?
Mar 24 13:17:05 <KaL>	tsahyt: file a bug report agains WebKitGtk component, pasting https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring-0.10.8.1/docs/Data-ByteString.html#v:map. as test case, it works in other browsers but no tin webkitgtk
Mar 24 13:17:40 <KaL>	if it's not gtk+ port specific or a duplicate we will handle it
Mar 24 13:17:52 <KaL>	but report it to ensure we don't forget about it
Mar 24 13:23:25 <tsahyt>	It already suggests the bug report I posted above as a duplicate
Mar 24 13:36:48 <tsahyt>	reported. I hope I didn't mess this up.
Mar 24 15:06:04 <rishi>	Is it known that various characters, cursor movements, etc. go missing when typing into a Google Document using webkitgtk+ 2.14.5?
Mar 24 15:06:12 *	rishi waits for his password reset email
Mar 24 15:09:09 <rishi>	Hmm... I am running Wayland. I'll first file the bug and then reboot into X.
Mar 26 11:27:19 <tanty>	rishi, happens to me still in 2.16.0 and X
Mar 26 11:27:24 <tanty>	please, do file a report about that
Mar 26 13:03:55 <hussam>	Will the fix for bug https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168912 make it to 2.16.1?
Mar 27 02:33:05 <mjog>	Hey all, does WK2 use SIGUSR2 at all?
Mar 27 02:33:37 <mjog>	(Also, is the mailing list borked? I'm getting "<<< 550 5.7.0 Local Policy Violation" trying to send an email to it)
Mar 27 04:17:47 <keis>	has something changed recently in webkit w/r to inheriting fds to the web process?
Mar 27 05:28:32 <hussam>	nevermind, I just checked the channel title. it's under proposed changes for 2.16.1 a;ready according to https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTK/2.16.x

Mar 27 12:53:30 <keis>	I've found after some investigation that pipe()s opened in initialize-web-extensions signal is not inherited
Mar 27 12:54:06 <keis>	I think that used to work
Mar 27 12:54:31 <mcatanzaro>	keis: Are you sure...? WebKit closes all fds except stdout/stdin/stderr I think.
Mar 27 12:55:00 <keis>	moving it outside the creation of the webview fixes it again
Mar 27 12:55:54 <keis>	or, well, it showed up in /proc again, I have yet to try to use it
Mar 27 12:55:57 <mcatanzaro>	Um, what do you mean by "inherited"
Mar 27 12:56:32 <keis>	in general when you clone() the subprocess have the same fds
Mar 27 13:01:15 <keis>	and yep, the pipes are happily pushing messages again
Mar 27 20:10:05 <lfam>	Greetings! Compiling webkitgtk+ 2.16.0, I noticed that it doesn't seem to need gnutls anymore, and instead it uses libgcrypt. But I didn't see it mentioned in NEWS. Is there any documentation about this change?
Mar 27 20:16:06 <lfam>	I suppose the changeset is self-documenting: http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/208297/webkit
Mar 28 11:51:54 <keis>	I found the feature I wanted in the "unstable" dom bindings
Mar 28 11:52:16 <keis>	is that soon stable, on the way out or somewhere in between?
Mar 28 11:53:54 <aperezdc_>	keis: “unstable” DOM bindings are not “unstable” in the sense that they would not work, but in the sense that the API may change from one WebKitGTK+ release to another
Mar 28 11:54:36 <keis>	ok. sounds good :)
Mar 28 11:55:05 <aperezdc_>	the reason is that the “unstable” DOM bindings are auto-generated from IDL files, so if those change, they will change, and there's not guarantee that we will manually patch them to preserve the existing API
Mar 28 11:55:41 <keis>	ok. I see. but that would be pretty minor things then I guess
Mar 28 11:55:45 <aperezdc_>	if there is something useful that a few applications use from the unstable DOM binsings, we can consider moving them to the “stable” set
Mar 28 11:55:52 <keis>	no big refactoring except maybe renames?
Mar 28 11:55:56 <aperezdc_>	and then we would maintain the API stable
Mar 28 11:56:22 <aperezdc_>	keis: yes, usually it's small changes in function names or sometimes the arguments they take
Mar 28 11:56:34 <keis>	ok. good to know
Mar 28 11:56:35 <aperezdc_>	they usually don't change for parts of the DOM that have stable specs
Mar 28 11:56:56 <aperezdc_>	“DOM specs” as in W3C DOM specs, I mean
Mar 28 11:57:36 <aperezdc_>	given the huge amount of autogenerated code, it's not practical for us to promise that those APIs won't change
Mar 28 11:57:56 <keis>	I'm using the scroll query/translate methods
Mar 28 11:58:08 <keis>	so pretty much 90s tech so I guess that won't change much
Mar 28 11:58:44 <aperezdc_>	yep, those are probably pretty safe to use
Mar 28 11:59:32 <aperezdc_>	and if they ever change, it should be minor fixes so maintenance from your applications point of view should be a small effort (if any)
Mar 28 14:43:58 <aidanh>	Spotted a typo in the new docs for webkit_website_data_manager_is_ephemeral(); "is-ephemerla"
Mar 29 06:47:01 <aperezdc_>	so... I am trying to add a check with g_idle_add() in WebKitTestRunner; it checks a condition and calls RunLoop::main().stop()
Mar 29 06:47:11 <aperezdc_>	but I am getting this segfault: http://sprunge.us/cKEN
Mar 29 06:47:24 <aperezdc_>	has anybody seen anything similar to this before?
Mar 29 06:48:21 <aperezdc_>	the problem seems to be that calling RunLoop::main().stop() leaves things in such a state that then RunLoop::main().run() cannot be called again
Mar 29 06:48:27 <aperezdc_>	is that so?
Mar 29 06:48:44 *	aperezdc_ needs a way to pause/interrupt the RunLoop and resume its execution
Mar 31 08:49:58 <rave>	WebkitWebProcess doesn't get killed automatically when the networkprocess is crashed
Mar 31 08:50:29 <rave>	does anybody know why it stays there ?? not sure if there is any crash detection taking place within the webkitgtk ?
Mar 31 08:50:50 <mcatanzaro>	If you reload the network process, does the web process get reused or does it just leak?
Mar 31 08:51:24 <rave>	never tried that , i would want to actually kill that webprocess too
Mar 31 08:51:33 <mcatanzaro>	It should *probably* get killed when network process crashes, but it's not a huge problem if it still works after you click reload
Mar 31 08:51:47 <mcatanzaro>	KaL ^
Mar 31 08:51:52 <rave>	does epiphany detects these two processes ?
Mar 31 08:52:00 <rave>	when they crashes
Mar 31 08:52:07 <mcatanzaro>	We have API to detect web process crashes, yes
Mar 31 08:52:22 <mcatanzaro>	Not for network process crashes, but it should still work
Mar 31 08:52:24 <rave>	is that in the MiniBrowser code too ?
Mar 31 08:52:32 <mcatanzaro>	I don't know
Mar 31 08:52:53 <KaL>	I don't think web process should be killed
Mar 31 08:53:02 <rave>	is that API online too?
Mar 31 08:53:17 <rave>	i mean the code that i can have a look?
Mar 31 08:53:50 <annulen>	NetworkProcess may be killed in the middle of processing request, I'm not sure if WebProcess can recover
Mar 31 08:53:50 <mcatanzaro>	Grep for web-process-crashed in WebKitWebView.cpp
Mar 31 08:55:58 <rave>	ah ok I can see the signal , wondering how it works with the network process ??
Mar 31 08:58:03 <mcatanzaro>	There is no signal for network process crashes. I guess it just breaks.
Mar 31 09:01:33 <rave>	oh ok , hmm so the network process is not a child process?
Mar 31 09:02:08 <mcatanzaro>	It is...
Mar 31 09:02:44 <annulen>	there is WebContextClient::networkProcessDidCrash
Mar 31 09:03:10 <mcatanzaro>	which we don't expose
Mar 31 09:03:15 <aperezdc_>	mmh, maybe we should expose that eventually
Mar 31 09:03:51 <aperezdc_>	or would it make sense to detect it crashed, kill WebProcess, and not change the API?
Mar 31 09:04:19 <mcatanzaro>	kill all web processes at once, even those that are not currently loading resources...?
Mar 31 09:04:33 <mcatanzaro>	I don't  know how best to handle ti
Mar 31 09:04:35 <mcatanzaro>	*it
Mar 31 09:05:38 <aperezdc_>	tricky ~_~
Mar 31 09:05:40 <KaL>	why do we have to kill the web process?
Mar 31 09:05:43 <annulen>	ask Alex maybe?
Mar 31 09:06:09 <aperezdc_>	KaL: maybe we don't need, but it could be that a WebProcess can get stuck if the NetProcess goes amok
Mar 31 09:06:54 <rave>	what does webprocess do when the networkprocess goes away?
Mar 31 09:09:01 <KaL>	nothing
Mar 31 09:09:15 <KaL>	when a new request is made a new network process will be launched
Mar 31 09:09:42 <KaL>	the same way the Ui process stays alive even if web processes crash
Mar 31 09:10:05 <mcatanzaro>	So only problem would be if it crashes when fulfilling an existing request (which will almost always be when it crashes), does it get relaunched and does the original request complete?
Mar 31 09:10:11 <mcatanzaro>	And if so, do we have logic to avoid loops?
Mar 31 09:10:30 <KaL>	I don't know the details
Mar 31 09:10:32 <annulen>	from what I see, WebLoaderStrategy::networkProcessCrashed() is called, it reschedules requests
Mar 31 09:11:16 <aperezdc_>	so then it seems we don't really need to expose a ::net-process-crashed
Mar 31 09:11:36 <rave>	so if webprocess dies then networkprocess stays there forever ?
Mar 31 09:11:41 <KaL>	I don't think so
Mar 31 09:12:01 <mcatanzaro>	Network process is supposed to stay forever (until UI process quits)
Mar 31 09:12:12 <KaL>	the network process is shared, it will be used for new web processes
Mar 31 09:12:49 <KaL>	I don't think so <- we should expose the network process crashed signal
Mar 31 09:13:30 <rave>	let's say if another instance of MiniBrowser or epiphany is launched which spawns another 2 (web and network process) then ?
Mar 31 09:14:25 <aperezdc_>	rave: each UIProcess has one shared NetProcess, used by all the WebProcesses spwned by that one UIProcess
Mar 31 09:14:31 <aperezdc_>	(but only for that UIProcess)
Mar 31 09:15:03 <aperezdc_>	so: if you have two different browsers which use webkitgtk+, you will have two NetProcesses (one of each)
Mar 31 09:15:48 <rave>	yeah , so if in one webprocess dies, network process stays there until we kill the UIProcess ?
Mar 31 09:18:43 <aperezdc_>	correct
Mar 31 09:19:25 <aperezdc_>	most likely the UIProcess will show something to the user, who will reload the crashes page, and that will already spawn a new WebProcess (which will use the NetProcess which is still around)
Mar 31 09:21:30 <rave>	oh ok thanks
Mar 31 09:27:24 <aperezdc_>	np

Apr 04 07:22:45 <tpopela>	joanie, Hi Joanie :) can you please look on https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170448 if it makes sense? :)
Apr 04 07:28:52 <antoyo>	Can someone help we with this issue, please: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164716 ?
Apr 04 07:59:46 <tpopela>	antoyo, hmm it looks like we indeed miss an API to create the WebKitDOMFileList.. And we should have it when we expose an API to set it.. The thing with these APIs is that they used to be autogenerated so we didn't have a way to limit what API we exposed.. But now when the APIs are "stable" (not generated) we should have a way to create it..
Apr 04 08:00:03 <tpopela>	antoyo, also did you tried to use JavaScript to do so?
Apr 04 08:00:40 <tpopela>	antoyo, through webkit_web_view_run_javascript() ?
Apr 04 08:00:54 <tpopela>	antoyo, I think that it should be possible to do so..
Apr 04 08:01:05 <antoyo>	No, I didn't because I prefer to have compile time check (I use the Rust bindings).
Apr 04 08:04:03 <tpopela>	antoyo, ah ok.. then someone needs to expose that API for creating the WebKitDOMFileList.. I don't know how hard it would be.. KaL (Hi Carlos!) do you know if it will be an easy task or not? We will need a way to create WebKitDOMFileList and also WebKitDOMFile items as well..
Apr 04 08:05:01 <KaL>	should be easy I guess, maybe just a matter of bringing that back from old unstable dom bindings api
Apr 04 08:06:13 <tpopela>	KaL, I don't know if we exposed it previously.. let me look..
Apr 04 08:11:07 <tpopela>	KaL, hmmm we didn't have it previously (at least in the WK1, but the DOM APIs didn't changed that much)..
Apr 04 08:21:02 <antoyo>	Could you please answer in the bug tracker? I've got to go soon.
Apr 04 09:41:49 <blino>	zdobersek: hi, I have a years-old patch in the Mageia WebKitGtk package, adding a allowScriptsToCloseWindows API similar to the one you just added in WPE : http://svnweb.mageia.org/packages/cauldron/webkit/current/SOURCES/webkit-2.1.90-allowScriptsToCloseWindows.patch?revision=472509&view=markup should I push upstream?
Apr 04 09:52:20 <zdobersek>	blino: yes
Apr 04 09:59:04 <blino>	ok, will do

Apr 04 22:54:35 <fujihiro>	bfulgham: Could you review this? https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157067
Apr 04 23:10:04 <fujihiro>	I'd like to bump freetype and icu of jhbuild for emoji <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156579>. Is there a version policy such like this? <https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTK/DependenciesPolicy>
Apr 05 02:57:49 <alexlarsson>	I have this webkit 2.16.1 build issue on arm (v7)
Apr 05 02:58:00 <alexlarsson>	For the gnome flatpak runtime
Apr 05 02:58:11 <alexlarsson>	Warning large log: https://gnome2.codethink.co.uk/logs/build-2017-04-04-214001/build-gnome-sdk-images-3-24-arm.txt
Apr 05 02:58:34 <alexlarsson>	It ends with
Apr 05 02:58:43 <alexlarsson>	 /tmp/ccgFL6eC.s: Assembler messages:
Apr 05 02:58:47 <alexlarsson>	 /tmp/ccgFL6eC.s:2610: Error: selected processor does not support `vmov s2,r1' in ARM mode
Apr 05 02:58:48 <alexlarsson>	...
Apr 05 02:58:56 <alexlarsson>	Has anyone seen this before?
Apr 05 05:06:11 <fujihiro>	KaL: What can I help for you? Can i file a bug ticket? Can I create a first patch?
Apr 05 05:15:51 <annulen>	fujihiro: as for jhbuild, there is no policy because this software versions affect only development builds of webkitgtk, not redistribution
Apr 05 05:16:10 <annulen>	however if you update freetype be ready to work on test rebasing
Apr 05 05:16:24 <annulen>	because render tree dumps of layout tests may change
Apr 05 05:16:27 <KaL>	fujihiro: feel free to file the bug report, I'll submit a patch taking into acount your proposal
Apr 05 05:16:55 <KaL>	annulen: https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-gtk/2016-October/002819.html
Apr 05 05:17:15 <KaL>	there's a policy, but we never did it in the end
Apr 05 05:18:27 <annulen>	oh, I wasn't subscribed to webkit-gtk list at that time
Apr 05 05:19:14 <annulen>	it would be great to run tests with fresher libs indeed
Apr 05 05:22:06 <fujihiro>	KaL: Filed. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170500
Apr 05 05:22:08 <fujihiro>	KaL: Who should I ask to put the latest stable ICU at here? <http://webkitgtk.org/jhbuild_mirror/>
Apr 05 05:22:45 <KaL>	fujihiro: hmm, clopez I guess
Apr 05 05:39:40 <KaL>	fujihiro: the versions of harfbuzz and freetype you are using in the patch are the minimum ones required for the colored emojies, or just the latest ones?
Apr 05 05:41:06 <fujihiro>	KaL: Just the latest.
Apr 05 05:42:03 <KaL>	fujihiro: they are too new, it would be better if we could use previous versions, for example harfbuzz 1.4.2 that is already in distros
Apr 05 05:42:13 <annulen>	freetype 2.5 should be enough for color fonts
Apr 05 05:43:31 <fujihiro>	I don't mind. But, KaL mentioned "latest stable" in this proposal. https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-gtk/2016-October/002819.html
Apr 05 05:43:37 <annulen>	btw iirc there were plans to make bots that use dependencies from packages, not from jhbuild, to improve distro compatibility

Apr 06 03:46:41 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos, 2.16.1 is already build.. But I can make scratch build with it and share it in the bug..
Apr 06 03:47:15 <KaL>	tpopela: no problem, they already confirmed the patch fixed the issue
Apr 06 03:47:50 <tpopela>	KaL, ok :).. but thanks for the patch this will be handy!
Apr 06 03:48:51 <KaL>	tpopela: ah, wait, I was thinking on a different bug
Apr 06 03:49:14 <tpopela>	KaL, https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170450
Apr 06 03:49:14 <tpopela>	?
Apr 06 03:49:19 <KaL>	tpopela: sorry, in this case I think it's worth it to make a new .1 packages with the patch
Apr 06 03:49:37 <KaL>	tpopela: to be able to fix the issue before .2
Apr 06 03:50:11 <KaL>	yes, I was thinking in that one
Apr 06 03:50:13 <tpopela>	KaL, I saw the message from Michael in the inbox.. yeah I will do a new build..
Apr 06 03:50:18 <KaL>	I don't know why
Apr 06 08:55:49 <tpopela>	KaL, when are you going to release next 2.14 (at least from I got the impression that you are working on it ;))
Apr 06 08:56:04 <KaL>	tpopela: hopefully today
Apr 06 08:56:10 <tpopela>	KaL, aaaaa..
Apr 06 08:56:12 <tpopela>	KaL, ok..
Apr 06 08:56:17 *	KaL feels watched :-D
Apr 06 08:56:50 <tpopela>	KaL, I thought that https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170448 can make it there..
Apr 06 08:56:59 <tpopela>	KaL, yeah, you are :D
Apr 06 08:58:21 <tpopela>	KaL, also can you backport  https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167900 and yours https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170506 ?
Apr 06 08:58:31 <annulen>	KaL: could you explain a bit how you do release management? just look at each commit in trunk and pick it or not? or maybe look what Apple backports to their branches, too?
Apr 06 08:59:41 <KaL>	tpopela: I prefer not to merge commits that make webkit crash in 2.14
Apr 06 09:00:19 <KaL>	annulen: I depends, for early versions like 2.16.1 and 2.16.2 i check every single commit in trunk
Apr 06 09:00:23 <tpopela>	KaL, ok.. but there was a possibility that it would crash anyway :)
Apr 06 09:01:28 <KaL>	annulen: for 2.14, for example, I'm only looking at CVEs and then whatever important we have merged in 2.16
Apr 06 09:01:43 <KaL>	and of course whatever you guys write down in the wiki
Apr 06 10:42:23 <tpopela>	KaL, Carlos did you ever saw: (process:17033): libsoup-WARNING **: SoupMessage 0x5628b94be940 stuck in infinite loop?
Apr 06 10:42:44 *	mcatanzaro has never seen that before
Apr 06 10:43:40 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, one internal RH site is triggering it.. and of course it won't load in the end..
Apr 06 10:59:47 <KaL>	tpopela: nope
Apr 06 11:02:06 <tpopela>	KaL, mcatanzaro looks like it is related to the Negotiate auth..
Apr 06 11:02:41 <KaL>	tpopela: I've seen that message with soup unit tests when implementing auth stuff
Apr 06 11:02:57 <KaL>	tpopela: so, it's probably a message that is re-queued all the time
Apr 06 11:03:28 <mcatanzaro>	Do we have layout tests for negotiate auth? I think if tpopela didn't write any himself, there probably aren't any?
Apr 06 11:03:57 <tpopela>	KaL, yeah.. I have to put away the dust from the libsoup auth codebase and look into it..
Apr 06 11:04:12 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, yeah I think that there is nothing..
Apr 06 11:04:23 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, it's not easy to set it up..
Apr 06 11:30:22 <keis>	when using the add_event_listener api is possible javascript on the page would interfer by stopping the bubbling etc?
Apr 06 15:43:52 <leio>	the CVE's not fixed in 2.14.6 won't be in the 2.14 series? And are they critical things?
Apr 06 15:44:13 <leio>	(or is 2.14 affected by these at all?)
Apr 06 15:44:36 <mcatanzaro>	clopez?
Apr 06 15:45:09 <mcatanzaro>	That does look pretty weird...
Apr 06 15:48:26 <leio>	versions affected: before 2.16.0 with 2.16.1 already out looks weird as well.
Apr 06 15:48:45 <mcatanzaro>	That one I can answer: the stuff fixed in 2.16.1 doesn't have CVEs yet
Apr 06 15:49:24 <leio>	so 2.14 series backports were delayed
Apr 06 15:50:40 <leio>	but yeah, I wonder if I should be looking at 2.14.6 or not with some open CVEs in the 2.14 series...
Apr 06 15:51:11 <mcatanzaro>	My recommendation is to always use the latest stable version, currently 2.16.1.
Apr 06 15:51:44 <clopez>	versions affected: before 2.16.0 -> means 2.16.0 is safe and any version after it
Apr 06 15:52:08 <leio>	I can not validate 2.16 will work with all the existing consumers without some outside reassurance
Apr 06 15:52:51 <leio>	(including epiphany-3.22 and evolution-3.22)
Apr 06 15:53:20 <leio>	clopez: the question is - how comes 2.14.6 only fixes a big set of the CVE's in that WSA, not all
Apr 06 15:53:47 <clopez>	leio: because some CVEs were inpractical to port
Apr 06 15:53:58 <mcatanzaro>	2.16.0 works fine with Ephy 3.22 and Evolution 3.22 or there would be tons of complaints from Fedora :)
Apr 06 15:54:05 <clopez>	we did the 2.14.6 for debian specifically because they refuse to update to 2.16.0 on stretch
Apr 06 15:54:12 <clopez>	otherwise we wouldn't have done a 2.14.6
Apr 06 15:54:19 <clopez>	the stable version is 2.16.1
Apr 06 15:54:21 <clopez>	you should use that
Apr 06 15:54:25 <leio>	I don't even have gnome 3.24 in unstable yet, that's the catch
Apr 06 15:54:29 <clopez>	the last stable
Apr 06 15:54:45 <leio>	ok, I can look into 2.16.1 and get it stabled with the excuse of security
Apr 06 15:55:12 <leio>	as long as I don't get surprises like came with some earlier 2.14.x and epiphany password manager
Apr 06 15:55:18 <mcatanzaro>	BTW this entire conversation validates my argument that releasing 2.14.6 was a bad idea... Debian could just as easily have backported those patches without us putting a stamp of approval on it.
Apr 06 15:55:41 <clopez>	yeah.. i also clarified on the list this
Apr 06 15:55:44 <leio>	I don't know anything about debian.
Apr 06 15:55:49 <clopez>	our policy for doing stable releases is this one https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTKStableReleases
Apr 06 15:55:56 <clopez>	we only mantain each stable release for 6 months
Apr 06 15:56:00 <clopez>	and we sync with gnome release schedule
Apr 06 15:56:09 <mcatanzaro>	Fixing the password manager to not give out all your passwords was a "surprise"...?
Apr 06 15:56:10 <clopez>	this 2.14.6 was a exception to the rule, and only because of debian
Apr 06 15:56:45 <leio>	the surprise was the claim by my team members that was still stuck at 3.20 for.. reasons.. claiming that the webkit upgrade broke epiphany
Apr 06 15:57:00 <leio>	so I mean the interlock
Apr 06 15:57:06 <mcatanzaro>	If so, nobody told me
Apr 06 15:57:39 <leio>	he might have very well been wrong, the point was not having surprises of a webkitgtk upgrade breaking an earlier minor version of epiphany or something else
Apr 06 15:57:43 <leio>	if that wasn't actually the case, good
Apr 06 15:57:45 <mcatanzaro>	We have Ephy 3.20 + WebKitGTK+ 2.16 in Fedora 24 right now with no complaints
Apr 06 15:58:09 <clopez>	ubuntu is also upgrading to the last stable version on the LTS version of their distro
Apr 06 15:58:12 <mcatanzaro>	Actually I think the 2.14 upgrade would have broken Ephy 3.20 if you didn't take the corresponding Ephy release
Apr 06 15:58:20 <leio>	regarding 6 months, for us 7 months can be good, IFF such incompatibilies might be a concern; otherwise doesn't matter if we get some communication going.
Apr 06 15:58:34 <leio>	mcatanzaro: yes, that was the issue.
Apr 06 15:58:35 <mcatanzaro>	Because Ephy used unstable DOM API that changed in 2.14
Apr 06 15:58:50 <mcatanzaro>	All that API was removed in 2.16 so it shouldn't be a problem anymore
Apr 06 15:59:09 <mcatanzaro>	It was really dumb to have Ephy depend on that, since it can go away at any time
Apr 06 15:59:22 <leio>	I got back into gentoo maintenance things, caugt us up to 3.22 finally, so at least 3.20 isn't a thing anymore
Apr 06 15:59:27 <leio>	killed all of those 5 days ago :)
Apr 06 15:59:42 <leio>	(in "stable")
Apr 06 15:59:55 <mcatanzaro>	Anyway the entire WebKitGTK+ API is stable as of 2.16 so that won't happen again. \o/
Apr 06 15:59:56 <leio>	so I'll just get us to 2.16.1 then.
Apr 06 16:00:29 <leio>	regarding your damning blog post earlier this year, I simply somehow missed the WSA mail; I was back by then, but all the catching up got it lost.
Apr 06 16:00:54 <leio>	and then after taking care of it, that DOM thing was a bit bad; but only for 2 days or so.
Apr 06 16:01:41 <mcatanzaro>	I think ephy was the only app that was ever affected
Apr 06 16:02:06 <leio>	yeah, don't tell me about that :D
Apr 06 16:02:14 <leio>	we still have a lot of 2.4 stuff aroudn.
Apr 06 16:03:25 <leio>	https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/3416#issuecomment-291888959 and https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/3417#issuecomment-291902071
Apr 06 16:03:31 <mcatanzaro>	leio: OK looking at the history, there was an Epiphany 3.20.4 release in tandem with WebKitGTK+ 2.14, do you have an upstream tracker to watch for that?
Apr 06 16:04:05 <leio>	mcatanzaro: i bumped webkitgtk, but was on 3.22 myself and didn't make the connection.
Apr 06 16:04:12 <mcatanzaro>	Admittedly it might not have been obvious they needed to be updated at the same time if you didn't read the NEWS file, but at least any regular update would have fixed it.
Apr 06 16:04:29 <leio>	yeah, I'd have missed it if it was in epiphany NEWS
Apr 06 16:04:39 <leio>	and it was adapted to in ephy-3.21
Apr 06 16:06:50 <leio>	might have caught with a note to distro-list or a ping :D
Apr 06 16:07:07 <leio>	(or there was one of the former, and I missed that like one of the WSAs)
Apr 06 16:07:31 <mcatanzaro>	Actually I did mail distributor list about that I think
Apr 06 16:08:01 <mcatanzaro>	Ahh it was not very clear
Apr 06 16:08:04 <mcatanzaro>	https://mail.gnome.org/archives/distributor-list/2016-August/msg00006.html (hidden at the bottom)
Apr 06 16:08:12 <mcatanzaro>	In the end only Ephy needed the rebuild, and only that one time
Apr 06 16:09:31 <leio>	I wasn't around wrt mail then
Apr 06 16:09:45 <leio>	I meant the Jan/Feb WSA
Apr 06 16:09:58 <leio>	that made us jump to 2.14 eventually for stable
Apr 06 16:11:13 <leio>	anyways, we are happy about any and all GNOME cycle related point releases up to 1-2 months of the next cycle having been around
Apr 06 16:11:37 <leio>	if there are incompatibilties for a security fix then that's something to know about beforehand; if not, then for security we can go earlier
Apr 06 16:12:40 <leio>	otherwise the entirety of what is in a GNOME cycle won't be in "stable" before at least 30 days have passed after it being in "testing", which can't be before a month it has been released upstream, but probably longer due to work to be done to get it to testing
Apr 06 16:13:32 <mcatanzaro>	The point of removing the unstable DOM API was to avoid surprises like that occurring again... sorry that it happened in the first place.
Apr 06 16:13:38 <leio>	hence sometimes supporting an earlier cycle release up to ~7 months instead of ~6 months can be nice, as for clear important bug or security fixes I'm happy to do it earlier than 30 days of appearance
Apr 06 16:14:02 <leio>	yeah, I'll just consider webkitgtk as something that doesn't have to be synced up with GNOME then
Apr 06 16:14:08 <leio>	going forward
Apr 06 16:14:52 <leio>	so if basic testing works out fine, you can expect to have webkit-gtk-2.16.1 in stable gentoo by end of the weekend :)
Apr 06 16:14:53 <mcatanzaro>	Yup! That's the right approach. Any ABI/API changes are bugs.
Apr 06 16:14:56 <leio>	well, for architectures that matter.
Apr 06 16:15:14 <leio>	(alpha says hello)
Apr 06 16:15:24 <mcatanzaro>	Well, *almost* any changes are bugs... if something is removed from the DOM spec then the corresponding functions may stop working. I think zero apps have ever been broken by such a change, though. :)
Apr 06 16:16:17 <leio>	unfortunately I don't think my current machine can get it build tested before sleep, so it won't go to architecture developers before tomorrow
Apr 06 16:19:13 <leio>	oh, and the HiDPI stuff 2.14.4 vs 2.14.5 wasn't neat either :D
Apr 06 16:19:29 <mcatanzaro>	Ah, that was just a bug though :)
Apr 06 16:19:46 <leio>	for us users get to go through the build process, os the quick ones got to do it twice
Apr 06 16:19:50 <mcatanzaro>	leio: https://mail.gnome.org/archives/distributor-list/2017-February/msg00002.html
Apr 06 16:20:18 <leio>	yes, https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=608958#c8
Apr 06 16:20:39 <leio>	we already had 2.14.4 stable by that time
Apr 06 16:28:29 <leio>	Bug 608958 has already taken the alias CVE-2017-2364. Please choose another alias.
Apr 06 16:28:30 <leio>	hmm :D
Apr 06 16:29:35 <leio>	(2.14.4 already claimed to fix it, now 2.14.6)
Apr 06 16:30:45 <leio>	otherwise, https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=614876
Apr 06 16:31:34 <leio>	(reports in that kind of format welcome to downstream when I'm not around to do that :)
Apr 06 16:33:14 <aperezdc_>	Is there anyone fluent with gtk_menu_popup_at_rect()? If so, I would appreciate a review of the patch I made for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170553
Apr 06 16:34:35 <aperezdc_>	I am quite confident that its usage is correct, but I find the GTK+ documentation lacking for that function O:-)

Apr 06 17:53:34 <leio>	what's all that gtk/patches/ stuff
Apr 06 17:54:01 <mcatanzaro>	leio: jhbuild patches for layout test environment, you can ignore it
Apr 06 17:55:11 <leio>	Tools/gtk/patches/
Apr 06 17:55:16 <leio>	layout test? :)
Apr 06 17:56:34 <leio>	we have users and architecture testers run all that stuff on all those exotic things, I'm not sure I want to ignore :)
Apr 06 17:57:04 <leio>	(all that stuff = what is in standard make check usually, or what I put in there additionally)
Apr 06 17:57:10 <mcatanzaro>	leio: Layout tests are definitely not expected to work from a release tarball, so you can definitely ignore it.
Apr 06 17:57:24 <leio>	ok
Apr 06 17:59:39 <leio>	might be interested in the patches against the actual upstream packages in question though
Apr 06 18:02:35 <leio>	mcatanzaro: how did you get from my ebuild link to WONTFIXing the C++ standard thing? :D
Apr 06 18:02:45 <leio>	in ephy
Apr 06 18:03:28 <leio>	s/C++/C/
Apr 06 18:09:08 <mcatanzaro>	leio: Bugzilla links :D
Apr 06 18:09:22 <mcatanzaro>	I'll port it to meson eventually and figure out the best practice for specifying C standard in meson
Apr 06 18:09:25 <mcatanzaro>	Then this problem will go away
Apr 06 18:09:37 <mcatanzaro>	Or maybe it will go away when everyone uses GCC 5
Apr 06 18:17:25 <leio>	mcatanzaro: that link would have been in epiphany ebuild, not webkitgtk :D
Apr 06 18:17:44 <mcatanzaro>	Oh I went from a Bugzilla link you gave me earlier.
Apr 06 18:17:48 <leio>	our toolchain has a bit dropped the ball on stabilizing gcc5, yes.
Apr 06 18:18:11 <mcatanzaro>	leio: You realize we have had GCC 7 in Fedora for a couple months now...? :)
Apr 06 18:18:19 <mcatanzaro>	(prerelease of course)
Apr 06 18:18:28 <leio>	we have gcc5.3 and gcc6.something
Apr 06 18:18:37 <mcatanzaro>	We mass rebuild everything with prerelease GCC to shake out the bugs with it
Apr 06 18:18:37 <leio>	stable, well, that's another matter
Apr 06 18:21:33 <leio>	some bus factor stuff going on there; but yeah, given that users are exercising that stuff, it ends up being the place where we aren't all that rolling

Apr 10 09:56:58 <annulen>	well, on mips it works fine for me
Apr 10 09:57:16 <tpopela>	annulen, so I can't really say if it improved..
Apr 10 09:57:30 <annulen>	ok, thanks
Apr 10 09:57:51 <tpopela>	annulen, yeah the situation around mips improved a lot.. maybe worth trying to turn it on at least for rawhide..
Apr 10 09:58:16 <tpopela>	annulen, and I suspect that JIT is implemented on MIPS as well..
Apr 10 09:58:31 <annulen>	yes
Apr 10 09:59:13 <tpopela>	annulen, thanks.. I will try to enable it then..
Apr 10 09:59:44 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, do you know why we don't have bmalloc and JIT enabled for aarch64?
Apr 10 10:00:07 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, ah..
Apr 10 10:00:08 <tpopela>	Fix the build on aarch64 - disable bmalloc as it's crashing when generating

Apr 10 10:00:24 <tpopela>	let's try it again as it was in 2.12.x times..

Apr 10 13:20:18 <leio>	but has an adorable garbled text instead of content in epiphany, https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167100

Apr 10 13:33:44 *	aperezdc_ has been on a hunt for popup improvement
Apr 10 13:34:13 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder how you'd even begin to debug an endianness issue like that
Apr 10 13:34:37 <mcatanzaro>	You have the unenviable position of being one of the only people in the world who care about running WebKit on PPC.
Apr 10 13:34:47 <mcatanzaro>	At least on Linux.
Apr 10 13:38:10 <mcatanzaro>	aperezdc_: r+
Apr 10 13:38:20 <mcatanzaro>	I was in a meeting when you asked earlier
Apr 10 13:38:32 <mcatanzaro>	I trust you've tested them both
Apr 10 13:39:14 <aperezdc_>	mcatanzaro: yes, and the complex one I even tested both the old and new code paths O:-)
Apr 10 13:39:48 <aperezdc_>	the long list of components in WebKit's Bugzilla is good for testing corner cases
Apr 10 13:40:03 <aperezdc_>	like the popup adjusting to the available screen height and so
Apr 10 13:40:05 <aperezdc_>	:P
Apr 10 13:41:23 <mcatanzaro>	Did you manage to fix that too?
Apr 10 13:41:44 <mcatanzaro>	Because it's super annoying that the popup goes past the edges of the screen :(
Apr 10 13:41:49 <mcatanzaro>	That's a Wayland-specific bug
Apr 10 13:42:19 <aperezdc_>	the one of the menus going outside the screen in Wayland is a bug in GTK+
Apr 10 13:42:41 <mcatanzaro>	Really? I haven't seen it in other apps.
Apr 10 13:42:45 <mcatanzaro>	Is there a bug report?
Apr 10 13:43:00 <mcatanzaro>	(I know other apps don't have huge menus, though.)
Apr 10 13:43:05 <aperezdc_>	well, I didn't try to fix that one bug with those two patches
Apr 10 13:43:34 <aperezdc_>	I think this one may help with that → https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145866
Apr 10 13:44:02 <aperezdc_>	I have to try it the existing patch here locally
Apr 10 13:44:18 <aperezdc_>	but no time for more popup menu fixes today
Apr 10 13:44:42 <aperezdc_>	I will still keep an eye on the bots, though
Apr 10 16:26:58 <aperezdc_>	Nice, it seems that my patches for the popup menus has not broken any layout tests
Apr 10 16:27:25 <aperezdc_>	that bein said, probably I should look into doing a bit of gardening one of these days

Apr 13 07:17:12 <quinq>	hi :)
Apr 13 07:19:06 <quinq>	Using WebKit2GTK, inside the “load-failed” signal, I get a gerror with a domain not defined on the WebKitError documentation
Apr 13 07:19:19 <quinq>	How/where could I find out what it is?
Apr 13 07:19:33 <annulen>	what domain do you get?
Apr 13 07:19:44 <quinq>	That's my question :)
Apr 13 07:19:50 <quinq>	It's decimal 1605
Apr 13 07:20:55 <quinq>	In this specific case, the message error is “Error resolving 'foo.bar': Name or service not known”
Apr 13 07:20:59 <ebassi>	You can use `g_quark_to_string(error->domain)`
Apr 13 07:21:01 <quinq>	(error code 2)
Apr 13 07:21:18 <quinq>	Ah, good idea ebassi, thanks
Apr 13 07:21:19 <ebassi>	But it's likely coming from GIO
Apr 13 07:21:48 <quinq>	Yeah, I was on that trail too, but I wanted to know what would be the best way to handle errors not defined in WebKitError
Apr 13 07:22:19 <ebassi>	g_error_matches()
Apr 13 07:22:33 <quinq>	Well I mean rather knowing all situations a load could fail and handle them correspondingly
Apr 13 07:23:13 <quinq>	I'd like to do more than just displaying the error message, so I have to know the error cases
Apr 13 07:23:13 <ebassi>	Ideally, the documentation should tell you which domains it will return, so you can use matches() accordingly
Apr 13 07:23:39 <quinq>	Yep :)
Apr 13 07:24:43 <quinq>	Here, this is from soup_http_error_quark
Apr 13 07:24:50 <ebassi>	If it doesn't, then it's like know handling a non-fatal exception: log the error somewhere
Apr 13 07:25:42 <quinq>	It's non-fatal, but it's a blocking error
Apr 13 07:26:04 <quinq>	And it's a "network" error
Apr 13 07:26:34 <quinq>	Well, at least I know how this one comes from, thanks
Apr 13 07:28:02 <quinq>	With more than 60 error codes ^^
Apr 13 07:29:39 <quinq>	Shouldn't those be gathered under WEBKIT_NETWORK_ERROR_FAILED?
Apr 13 07:32:09 <ebassi>	It depends; it would imply catching all errors inside webkit at all times, then checking if there's an existing domain/code that fits, and re-packaging the error
Apr 13 07:32:40 <ebassi>	It's like catching all exceptions and re-throwing them
Apr 13 07:34:11 <ebassi>	In general, G* libraries prefer propagating errors and leaving to callers to do matching; of course, the documentation needs to be kept up to date :-)
Apr 13 07:35:02 <quinq>	Good point

Apr 19 01:15:58 <fujihiro>	tanty: Could you comment about this? https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170902#c1
Apr 19 08:23:22 <aperezdc_>	KaL, clopez: super simple one-liner review → https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170987
Apr 19 08:23:53 <aperezdc_>	also, could one of you add it to the patches to apply for the 2.16.2 release in the wiki? (unfortunately I can't edit the wiki ~_~)
Apr 19 08:39:39 <aperezdc_>	KaL: thanks!
Apr 19 12:03:09 <youenn>	hi guys, we are trying to land today (or tomorrow...) https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170718
Apr 19 12:03:25 <youenn>	That will probably require some clean-up in the bots running tests to land
Apr 19 12:03:42 <youenn>	properly
Apr 19 12:04:02 <youenn>	Any idea on who I should coordinate with on gtk side?
Apr 19 12:09:32 <mcrha>	hi there, just a quick question, is <audio></audio> processed through some sort of plugin or anything like that? I have a simple HTML code which references a wav file and that code can play "inline" the file in epiphany, but not in evolution and I wonder whether it requires to enable anything specific, because evolution doesn't enable plugins (for security reasons)
Apr 19 12:10:53 <alexg__>	youenn, ping KaL or clopez
Apr 19 12:11:46 <youenn>	ok, thanks!
Apr 19 12:11:52 <KaL>	mcrha: there's a setting to enable web audio
Apr 19 12:12:05 <KaL>	youenn: yes, me and/or clopez
Apr 19 12:12:36 <mcrha>	hi KaL, oh, it's done through web audio, I see. I noticed that setting, but the description didn't sound like it
Apr 19 12:12:40 <mcrha>	let me try it
Apr 19 12:13:38 <annulen>	<audio> has nothing to do with WebAudio
Apr 19 12:14:21 <KaL>	ah, no idea then
Apr 19 12:14:34 <annulen>	it's handled by the same code as <video>, except small details
Apr 19 12:15:02 <annulen>	WebAudio allows to generate sound algorithmically, or process it
Apr 19 12:15:20 <mcrha>	looks like it, because it didn't help
Apr 19 12:15:54 <mcrha>	I see on the page that black "player", but it shows time 00:00 and doesn't play anything when I press the play button
Apr 19 12:19:36 <mcrha>	I know we've been dealing with something similar in the past, but I do not recall any detail from it.
Apr 19 12:20:30 <mcrha>	neither default settings make the trick (all in default except "auto-load-images", TRUE, "default-charset", "utf-8")
Apr 19 12:27:09 <mcrha>	okay, so it requires "enable-javascript", which is not an option for evolution when showing random mail content
Apr 19 12:28:50 <annulen>	hmm, maybe it's because new media controls require javascript
Apr 19 12:30:06 <mcrha>	maybe. I think it wasn't the case in the past, but my past dates back to something like WebKitGTK+ with WebKit1, not WebKit2.
Apr 19 12:30:17 <annulen>	indeed, disabling js breaks controls, so only autoplay elements can work
Apr 19 12:30:30 <annulen>	in the past controls were implemented in c++
Apr 19 12:31:19 <mcrha>	ah, okay, then I'll disable inline playing of audio files, to not confuse users of evolution
Apr 19 12:32:18 <mcrha>	there is some more catch-up on the evolution side, as I had been able to reproduce this out of it, with my old test app which uses WebKit2 by changing the settings
Apr 19 12:32:44 <mcrha>	but it doesn't matter, javascript in general is not a good thing for emails, especially not for those HTML
Apr 19 12:32:57 <annulen>	it should be possible to implement selective disabling of JS
Apr 19 12:33:07 <mcrha>	on evo side?
Apr 19 12:33:13 <annulen>	to allow controls, not in webkit
Apr 19 12:33:18 <annulen>	*no in webkit
Apr 19 12:33:29 <mcrha>	I see. evo is full of iframe-s
Apr 19 12:34:10 <youenn>	KaL and clopez: https://trac.webkit.org/r215515
Apr 19 12:34:11 <mcrha>	annulen, never mind, I believe you've better things to work on. Definitely thanks for confirming.
Apr 19 12:34:23 <youenn>	Will monitor how bots digests it...

Apr 19 13:41:53 <quinq>	Hi, I have a question regarding tls info
Apr 19 13:42:14 <quinq>	webkit_web_view_get_tls_info() will set errors in GTlsCertificateFlags *errors
Apr 19 13:42:27 <quinq>	What would be the value for no error?
Apr 19 13:42:34 <quinq>	Would that be FALSE or G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_VALIDATE_ALL?
Apr 19 13:42:48 <quinq>	(I'm not sure what would be G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_VALIDATE_ALL in this error context)
Apr 19 14:47:30 <KaL>	youenn: it seems the wpt server is not working correctly on out bot
Apr 19 14:47:43 <KaL>	*in our bot
Apr 19 14:48:25 <KaL>	I have to go now, I hope clopez can help to handle issue with the bot
Apr 19 14:59:42 <youenn>	KaL: Need to call Tools/Scripts/clean-webkit
Apr 19 15:00:11 <youenn>	Or simply remove LayoutTests/imported/w3c/web-platform-tests and recheck out it
Apr 19 17:01:41 <clopez>	i have removed all the build directory and forced a new svn checkout
Apr 19 17:01:43 <clopez>	let's see
Apr 19 18:19:57 <clopez>	yep, that fixed it..
Apr 20 06:33:29 <clopez>	kov: can you please run apt-get install libmount-dev on the 32-bit and arm buildbots?
Apr 20 08:13:42 <twister_>	Hi all. I have some questions on how to add touch support to webkit2gtk-4.0 in one of my Vala programs. If anyone here is interested to help, please do :) i've been stuck with a partially frozzen webkit for days.. The page loads normally and resizing works, but from what I could see, touch and scroll events are handled in a weird way now :D

Apr 25 08:48:14 <magomez>	blino: they work fine for me
Apr 25 09:07:30 <clopez>	blino: did you tried after r215727 ?
Apr 25 09:19:37 <blino>	clopez: nope, will do
Apr 25 09:21:11 <blino>	zdobersek: libgcrypt 1.7.0 is now required, but Ubuntu 16.04 (current LTS) only provides 1.6.5
Apr 25 09:26:36 <zdobersek>	blino, we're adding it to jhbuild https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171270

Apr 26 08:18:14 <annulen>	KaL: ^
Apr 26 08:30:39 <tpopela>	rdlp, what WebKitGTK+ version are you using?
Apr 26 08:31:55 <tpopela>	rdlp, I see that it's probably a WebKit1 based so anything < 2.4.11
Apr 26 08:57:00 <rdlp>	tpopela, It is a webkit1 version 1.8.3 based on gtk-3.0
Apr 26 08:57:25 <tpopela>	rdlp, why you use such an old version?
Apr 26 08:58:12 <tpopela>	rdlp, if you insist on using WebKit1 then you should use 2.4.11, but you should move to WebKit2 based WebKitGTK+ and that's 2.16.x
Apr 26 09:00:23 <rdlp>	tpopela, because I installed directly from ubuntu repositories. I am going to study move to webkitgtk 2.4.11 or to webkitgtk2
Apr 26 09:04:08 <tpopela>	rdlp, yeah definitely try 2.4.11 or move to 2.16.x.. There you can use https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitWebView.html#webkit-web-view-run-javascript to manipulate with DOM.. Or you can create an WebKitWebExtension - https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitWebExtension.html if you will need advanced things..
Apr 26 09:14:29 <quinq>	1.8.3 is only 4 years old
Apr 26 09:15:53 <tpopela>	quinq, only? :D for a web engines it's like a previous century..
Apr 26 09:20:51 <rdlp>	tpopela, 2.16.x is webkit2?
Apr 26 09:20:58 <annulen>	rdlp: yes
Apr 26 09:21:17 <rdlp>	the last webkit1 version is 2.4.11?
Apr 26 09:21:18 <tpopela>	rdlp, everything that's above 2.4.x
Apr 26 09:21:28 <tpopela>	rdlp, yes
Apr 26 09:22:22 <quinq>	Yeah tpopela, that was sarcastic ;)
Apr 26 09:22:52 <tpopela>	quinq, please use quotes next time :D
Apr 26 09:22:58 <quinq>	:>
Apr 26 12:38:09 <rave>	is there any good way to tell which version of Safari shares the same WebCore as latest WebkitGTK+ release?
Apr 26 12:41:18 <annulen>	rave: look at user-agent
Apr 26 12:41:41 <rave>	annulen: Thanks
Apr 26 13:53:38 <rdlp>	I am building webkit from the sources, I have run configure and make and now it generate .la files (libtools files). How can I generate now static libraries (.a) or shared objects (.so)?
Apr 26 13:54:23 <annulen>	seems like you are building obsolete version
Apr 26 13:54:37 <annulen>	autotools build was removed long ago
Apr 26 13:58:26 <rdlp>	I have compiled 2.4.11 version
Apr 26 13:59:08 <annulen>	that's obsolete, use 2.16
Apr 26 14:01:56 <rdlp>	with 2.16 can I use webkit1 instead webkit2?
Apr 26 14:03:13 <annulen>	no
Apr 26 14:03:43 <annulen>	but you can port your code, there should be example somewhere
Apr 26 14:35:09 <rdlp>	ok, I will try with webkitgtk2, what if I would like to use webkit 2.4.11 how can I generate libraries without using make install?
Apr 26 14:37:13 <annulen>	look in .libs
Apr 26 15:01:29 <rdlp>	ahh thanks, I don't see it in termina due to . (point)
Apr 26 15:02:06 <annulen>	that's how autotools work
Apr 27 05:25:22 <nacho_>	hey guys
Apr 28 08:25:54 <blino>	clopez: hi, did you have time to get a look at the WebP animated patch? any thing that is missing at first look?
Apr 28 08:32:06 <clopez>	blino: no sorry, i didn't have time to look into it.. i may test it next week
Apr 28 09:28:03 <quinq>	Hi, it looks like Google© broke webkit compatibility with their new login process, or is it just on my side?
Apr 28 13:56:33 <MarcinWieczorek>	Hi guys, can I get help with WebKitGTK in C++ here?
Apr 28 14:04:47 <MarcinWieczorek>	Anyone here?

May 01 13:26:44 <aidanh>	I've been looking at the WebKitWebView script-dialog signal recently; am I correct in thinking that there's no way to asynchronously handle this?
May 01 13:27:19 <aidanh>	I'd like to implement script dialogs that block only the current tab, like firefox has. But that seems impossible with this API
May 02 04:45:43 <fujihiro>	Gtk build bots are broken. <https://build.webkit.org/builders> Removing WebInspector images makes incremental build broken. Could anyone trigger clean build?
May 02 12:41:36 <rave>	has anybody tried building webkitgtk+ on windows ?
May 02 12:48:12 <mcatanzaro>	rave: We dropped Windows support in 2013, sorry :(
May 02 12:49:14 <rave>	mcatanzaro: oh ok, yeah I assumed so, also even if I get it to build, I am guessing will not be able to see the right performance with webgl
May 02 12:49:25 <annulen>	I have wip win ipc for wk2, but it's not yet ready
May 02 12:49:32 <annulen>	fighting attachment passing now
May 02 12:50:53 <annulen>	rave: there are high chances you won't be able to see webgl at all :)
May 02 12:50:57 <annulen>	without additional changes
May 02 12:51:12 <rave>	annulen: oh ok , because of cairo ?
May 02 12:52:16 <annulen>	because of missing/broken texture sharing between webprocess and uiprocess
May 02 12:53:14 <rave>	annulen: u mean shared mem?
May 02 12:54:17 <annulen>	kind of, shared gpu memory :)
May 02 12:54:54 <rave>	annulen: oh ok thanks
May 02 12:57:38 <annulen>	rave: if you want webgl on windows with webkit, your options are wincairo, or wk1 api of qtwebkit
May 02 12:58:28 <rave>	annulen: is wk1 using wincairo?
May 02 12:59:12 <annulen>	wincairo is wk1-based
May 02 12:59:24 <annulen>	i.e., not multiprocess
May 02 12:59:37 <annulen>	so no dark arts for webgl
May 02 13:00:56 <rave>	annulen: oh ok any links to this port?
May 02 13:02:21 <rave>	annulen: I am just thinking of how good the performance would be , since it will be using cygwin? Or else I can just use Chromium embedded framework
May 02 13:02:57 <annulen>	no cygwin
May 02 13:03:17 <rave>	https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/BuildingCairoOnWindows this link suggested that ?
May 02 13:03:28 <annulen>	only build dependency
May 02 13:04:02 <annulen>	fwiw, for qtwebkit you can just download binaries and start
May 02 13:05:04 <rave>	and isn't qtwebkit using MinGW ?
May 02 13:05:36 <rave>	is there any stable webkit based browser on windows?
May 02 13:05:37 <annulen>	mingw or msvc
May 02 13:05:41 <annulen>	as you want
May 02 13:05:53 <annulen>	e.g. you can take Otter
May 02 13:06:01 <annulen>	https://otter-browser.org/
May 02 13:06:29 <rave>	is that on webkit or any other port ?
May 02 13:06:35 <rave>	i mean like qtwebkit
May 02 13:06:36 <annulen>	qtwebkit
May 02 13:06:40 <rave>	or wincairo
May 02 13:07:12 <annulen>	I don't know about wincairo browsers, Sony uses it in their products, and EA used in the past
May 02 13:07:36 <annulen>	actually, I may be wrong about Sony
May 02 13:08:19 <rave>	and any qtwebkit based browser ?
May 02 13:08:57 <annulen>	[20:06] <annulen> https://otter-browser.org/
May 02 13:09:24 <rave>	oh ok cool
May 02 13:09:49 <rave>	thanks annulen, my worry is performance will that be any better than chromium framework

May 03 11:50:54 <mcatanzaro>	rdlp: To fix that we'd need a bug report including a backtrace to the critical warning.

May 03 11:51:39 <mcatanzaro>	If you post a backtrace on a pastebin and link to it here, I'd be happy to take a look. We can't do anything without a backtrace, though.
May 03 16:28:48 <rdlp>	mcatanzaro, thanks for your reply, I will try to post here the backtrace

May 05 05:05:06 <Kekun1>	mcatanzaro: hey, are you around? :)
May 05 05:06:08 <Kekun1>	probably not given the time
May 05 08:07:30 <mcatanzaro>	Kukun1: 4 hola
May 05 08:07:40 <mcatanzaro>	*4 AM
May 05 08:07:49 <mcatanzaro>	I mean, it was 4 AM.... :P
May 05 08:58:46 <Kekun1>	mcatanzaro: hey, I was looking at https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155750 which is on my neverending TODO list since too long :)
May 05 09:00:43 <Kekun1>	though I currently don't have the setup to work on WKGTK+
May 05 09:00:44 <Kekun1>	but yeah, I would like to see that merged
May 05 09:38:31 <aperezdc2>	Kekun: Would it be okay if one of us would pick your patch and prep it up for landing?
May 05 10:08:27 <mcatanzaro>	Kekun1: Yes I want to land that. It's probably bitrotted, though, so it needs to be rebased.
May 05 10:08:57 <mcatanzaro>	BTW I still don't understand what kinetic scrolling is, even though you've tried to explain it to me and I know users complain we don't support it :P
May 05 10:12:06 <annulen>	in Qt port we have smooth scrolling support based on what EFL used but with a bit different curves
May 05 10:25:36 <Kekun1>	aperezdc2: of course :) you would probably do it way faster than me
May 05 10:28:04 <Kekun1>	mcatanzaro: the idea is that when you scroll and your scroll ends, instead of stopping suddenly it keeps scrolling at the same speed, slowly descelerating
May 05 10:29:19 <annulen>	it also has some (small) acceleration period
May 05 10:31:15 <Kekun1>	mcatanzaro: it is typically only enabled on inputs from touchpads or touchscreen as on these it feels more natural, it is also more confortable and less tiring as you need less physical inputs to scroll
May 05 10:32:32 <annulen>	actually, it creates better feeling on normal screens as well, if done right
May 05 10:33:02 <mcatanzaro>	So... is your implementation enabled always, or only on touch?
May 05 10:34:54 <annulen>	my? disabled by default, enabled with option
May 05 10:38:26 <Kekun1>	mcatanzaro: only on touch, the behavior is exactly the same as GTK+ was a year ago (it probably didn't change)

May 08 13:01:06 <N80>	hey, complete noob here. i found a patch for webkitgtk online (for the google sign in) but i have no idea how to install it. i know you guys are the experts and can point me in the right direction.
May 08 13:05:24 <N80>	anyone there?
May 08 13:06:55 <t0by>	Hi. I have *that* bug with Google authentication, I'm sure you already know what I'm talking about already.
May 08 13:07:05 <t0by>	Is there any quick workaround I can do?
May 08 13:07:13 <t0by>	\I just installed a fresh Ubuntu 17.04
May 08 13:07:17 <N80>	im here for the same thing man
May 08 13:07:20 <N80>	this irc is dead
May 08 13:07:35 <N80>	theres a patch https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171770
May 08 13:07:45 <N80>	but i have no idea how to install
May 08 13:08:51 <t0by>	I have one or two ideas
May 08 13:09:00 <t0by>	configure && make && make install, for starters
May 08 13:09:07 <t0by>	but I don't want to bork my install
May 08 13:09:32 <t0by>	so if somebody knows...
May 08 13:09:39 <N80>	i'm just getting started with linux, there doesnt seem to be any guides on how to patch things
May 08 13:09:55 <N80>	or at least not this one
May 08 13:09:59 <N80>	with webkit
May 08 13:10:24 <N80>	im going afk, let me know if u find anything
May 08 13:10:46 <t0by>	N80: you'd have to build and install in the usual way
May 08 13:11:15 <t0by>	But I'm way of doing it unless somebody tells me it doesn't cause issues
May 08 13:11:22 <t0by>	(with the stuff shipped in 17.04)
May 08 13:47:28 <mcatanzaro>	t0by: Probably the easiest thing to do is wait for an Ubuntu update. It will probably come very soon.
May 08 13:48:02 <t0by>	mcatanzaro: thanks; thanks for your hard work in fixing this fast.
May 08 13:48:19 <t0by>	mcatanzaro: so you would discourage downloading the tarball and make ; make install ?
May 08 13:48:23 <t0by>	You don't happen to have tried, have you?
May 08 13:48:33 <mcatanzaro>	t0by: If you want to try building WebKit yourself, you can do so, but it uses CMake, not Autotools.
May 08 13:48:52 <mcatanzaro>	So the process would be more like 'cmake' 'make' 'make install'
May 08 13:49:25 <mcatanzaro>	I wouldn't try this unless you're familiar with Linux packaging (probably not if you have this question :) as you can mess up your OS if you make a mistake doing this.
May 08 13:49:50 <mcatanzaro>	I've let Ubuntu know about this issue and I expect they'll have an update "soon"
May 08 13:52:37 <t0by>	mcatanzaro: I'm a software developer by trade; I'm more of a MSVC guy so I'm not scared about building stuff per se. But yes, I don't know anything about Ubuntu packaging, so if there is a risk of borking the system...I'll wait.
May 08 13:52:39 <t0by>	Thanks.
May 08 13:53:39 <mcatanzaro>	t0by: You just want to make sure you don't accidentally install anything into /usr instead of /usr/local... it should actually do the right thing by default. But CMake does not have an uninstall target, so you have to manually remove all the files by hand when you want to uninstall it. Hence packaging it up would be recommended. And Ubuntu is already working on that. :)
May 08 13:56:49 <N80>	i think i figured out how to patch it. what should i target with cmake? there is a source and a tools folder... i put the patch in the tools one because thats where it said to go. i don't care if i mess up my system, its a dual boot and this install is just for messing around
May 08 13:57:36 <mcatanzaro>	N80: You have to apply the patch using the "patch" command line tool.
May 08 13:57:44 <mcatanzaro>	WebKit is not going to automatically do that for you.
May 08 13:58:07 <mcatanzaro>	You could also just edit the affected file by hand, since it's a small patch... might actually be easier than learning to use 'patch'
May 08 13:58:58 <N80>	i downloaded the source tarball, and the cpp file of the patch. i was planning to build and install it from the latest source but if those files are somewhere on the system already where would they be
May 08 13:59:00 <mcatanzaro>	To build: 'cmake -DPORT=gtk' should suffice. Then 'make -jN' where N is the number of parallel jobs to run. You'll be waiting a long time if you forget this. ;)
May 08 13:59:41 <mcatanzaro>	N80: The source code does not get installed. It is compiled into a shared library that gets installed.
May 08 13:59:47 <N80>	gotcha
May 08 14:00:16 <t0by>	N80: please let me know how it goes for you
May 08 14:00:41 <N80>	i will once i'm done installing cmake dependencies
May 08 14:00:50 <t0by>	mcatanzaro: thank you a lot. fwiw I'm more wary of overwriting the files shipped with the distro.
May 08 14:01:02 <mcatanzaro>	'sudo make install' when you're done. This will override Ubuntu's packaged version of WebKit forever until you remove all the files it installs manually!
May 08 14:01:57 <mcatanzaro>	But it should install them all under /usr/local so it should not overwrite anything shipped by Ubuntu. The Ubuntu version will just not be used until you remove the version you have installed under /usr/local. If you remove only some of the files and not all of them, then you could wind up with weird bugs, so be careful to note down what all gets installed.
May 08 14:01:57 <N80>	alright. im on a fedora based distro but that shouldn't affect the process right?
May 08 14:02:34 <mcatanzaro>	N80: Correct... but we'll have a Fedora update ready tomorrow, if you don't mind waiting a day.
May 08 14:03:05 <mcatanzaro>	You'd have to install it manually to get it tomorrow, but that would be easier than building it yourself.
May 08 14:03:14 <mcatanzaro>	And it would be an RPM. ;)
May 08 14:03:35 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: ^ I am making promises for you here. xD
May 08 14:04:09 <N80>	i might just do that if i run into any more problems
May 08 14:04:29 <N80>	i'm making it now
May 08 14:05:33 <N80>	thanks for all your help so far. i'll be back later with my results
May 08 16:30:13 <N80>	hey, i'm back now. i guess i did something wrong because there were no errors or anything, it successfully made and installed, but it didn't fix the problem
May 08 16:32:48 <N80>	mcatanzaro, where would one expect to find the fixed rpm package when it goes up tomorrow?
May 08 17:03:40 <mcatanzaro>	N80: Best way would be to ask again here. It will be on koji.fedoraproject.org and you might be able to search for it with the search interface.
May 08 17:04:03 <mcatanzaro>	Might be more like tomorrow night, since it will take a while to build and the build won't be started until after tomorrow's 2.16.2 release.
May 08 17:08:47 <mcatanzaro>	FYI, here's another workaround for Epiphany users... again, it requires patching the code unfortunately, but an Epiphany patch is a lot easier to deal with than a WebKit patch. You could even just change the TRUE to FALSE in ephy-embed-prefs.c.
May 08 17:08:52 <mcatanzaro>	Oh, link: https://git.gnome.org/browse/epiphany/commit/?h=gnome-3-24&id=bf377b5e31e84c8d60d82ecf2b04dff7cb670e60
May 08 17:15:16 <N80>	thanks again for your help
May 09 02:06:21 <allen>	can any body tell how to build dumprendertree

May 09 05:35:30 *	KaL has changed the topic to: WebKitGTK+ stable: 2.16.2, unstable: 2.17.1 | Homepage: http://webkitgtk.org/ |  http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTK/2.14.x | https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTK/2.16.x | "HTML is useful for a web content rendering engine."
May 09 17:26:00 <quinq>	hi
May 09 17:27:05 <quinq>	I was wondering when I should set proxy settings (using 2.16)
May 09 17:28:12 <quinq>	I wanted to set it up on load-changed signal with WEBKIT_LOAD_STARTED, but then the load fails with WEBKIT_NETWORK_ERROR_CANCELLED
May 09 17:28:56 <quinq>	I thought WEBKIT_LOAD_STARTED was sent before connections were made
May 09 17:29:14 <quinq>	(using webkit_web_context_set_network_proxy_settings())
May 09 18:31:16 <leio>	mcatanzaro: hum, google login is working just fine for me with 2.16.1? What am I doing wrong (trying to gauge the promotion to stable speed need)
May 09 18:31:49 <leio>	(I didn't actually re-do my account though, but I got as far as entering alternative account address etc and haven't seen any white pages)
May 09 18:32:36 <mcatanzaro>	leio: It's a staged rollout. You still have the old login page, right? New login page is expected to be broken, unless Google just fixed it today. (I attempted to complain. :)
May 09 18:32:55 <leio>	mcatanzaro: I don't know how the old and new ones differ in looks.
May 09 18:33:09 <mcatanzaro>	Alternatively if you have enable-site-specific-quirks disabled... it's caused by a quirk to make other Google sites work
May 09 18:33:27 <mcatanzaro>	leio: Then you have the old one. The new one is very different.
May 09 18:33:40 <leio>	I don't recall ever seeing it go this way I saw it now though.
May 09 18:34:26 <leio>	ah, it's white after password enter.
May 09 18:34:39 <mcatanzaro>	yup
May 09 18:34:42 <leio>	https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/challenge/password/empty
May 09 18:35:02 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder why that even exists
May 09 18:39:29 <leio>	ok, so stabilization in my next batch in ~1 week it is then
May 09 18:39:42 <leio>	(we usually follow some sort of 30 days guideline before it, not 1 week)
May 09 20:11:47 <leio>	mcatanzaro: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170106 isn't in 2.16.2 :(
May 09 20:13:06 <mcatanzaro>	leio: I'll add it to the backports list for the next release
May 09 20:13:22 <leio>	thx
May 09 20:13:43 *	leio ponders if to go with our version or the backport
May 09 20:14:49 <leio>	guess fujihiro version actually parallelizes and I should give that a spin
May 09 20:19:31 *	leio is tired of carrying around the alpha/ia64 patches too
May 09 20:19:45 <mcatanzaro>	Are there upstream bugs for those?
May 09 20:21:07 <leio>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167283 was onee
May 09 20:21:12 <leio>	ia64 maybe not
May 09 20:24:35 <leio>	sigh, these trac patches are so uselss
May 10 02:49:29 <quinq>	Hello, anybody able to help me with my issue?
May 10 09:36:47 <rdlp>	mcatanzaro, I created a pastebin with the problem that I commented a few days ago ( GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_object_ref: assertion 'object->ref_count > 0' failed) I think that you can't fix the (possible) bug because I am using the last version of webkit1 (2.4.11)
May 10 09:36:58 <rdlp>	here is the pastebin: https://pastebin.com/ZpYtRTAz
May 10 09:37:21 <rdlp>	And I have done test and the problem is a <span> tag
May 10 09:48:09 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Thanks for the 'cannot sign in to Google' fix!
May 10 09:57:35 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: That was a nightmare
May 10 09:57:36 <mcatanzaro>	It's over now :)
May 10 09:57:57 <mcatanzaro>	rdlp: Yeah we're not going to help unless you're using the latest stable version (2.16.2) or a development version, sorry!
May 10 09:59:15 <mcatanzaro>	quinq: You need to set the proxy settings before load started, because I think changing proxy settings will cancel the load,
May 10 09:59:47 <mcatanzaro>	(That might depend on the version of libsoup you have... that got implemented and then reverted recently)
May 10 09:59:48 <quinq>	Yes, that's what it seems to do :/
May 10 10:00:28 <mcatanzaro>	At any rate, even if it wasn't canceled, you'd be gambling as to whether the settings get used or not. Do you really need to use different proxy settings for different load operations?
May 10 10:00:55 <quinq>	My goal is to set or not proxy, depending on requested domain
May 10 10:01:28 <quinq>	I know that it's possible to issue an ignore list for a webkitproxy, but that's not really the goal
May 10 10:01:59 <quinq>	Well, not to set it or not, but rather to set different proxies
May 10 10:02:07 <quinq>	(both actually)
May 10 10:02:51 <quinq>	I apply most of my settings at LOAD_STARTED and it works fine, proxy seems to be an issue
May 10 10:05:08 <quinq>	Thanks for the confirmation, I'll see if I can do it elsewhere in a more sensible way
May 10 10:05:34 <quinq>	Because I'll need to be able to modify it on LOAD_REDIRECTED too
May 10 10:05:40 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: :) Do you think that it is worth informing distributor-list?
May 10 10:06:09 <quinq>	And yes, thanks for the Google login fix too :)
May 10 10:06:22 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: No, because all distributors should be upgrading WebKit anyway
May 10 10:06:42 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: They all have heard this message by now
May 10 10:07:04 <kwm>	I would like to thank the webkit team for also releasing a new 2.14
May 10 10:07:07 <quinq>	Or should face the consequences otherwise
May 10 10:07:17 <mcatanzaro>	quinq: It looks like what you want is the inverse of the ignore_hosts setting, right?
May 10 10:07:44 <quinq>	Something like that, yes
May 10 10:08:11 <mcatanzaro>	kwm: Be aware that it does not include a comprehensive set of security updates. You should still upgrade to 2.16.2 if your device is connected to the Internet.
May 10 10:09:01 <kwm>	mcatanzaro: I'm working on that update as we speak, but at least google works still :)
May 10 10:09:19 <mcatanzaro>	I think the reason there is no inverse of ignore_hosts is we implemented the new proxy API using GSimpleProxyResolver, and just paralleled that API... and did not realize that it would be useful to be able to specify a proxy to use only for specific hosts.
May 10 10:09:55 <quinq>	I think it's quite useful for TOR users for exemple
May 10 10:10:09 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: ^ proxy API request... might be hard to implement
May 10 10:10:42 <quinq>	But honestly, I'm fine dealing with it outside Webkitgtk API
May 10 10:10:52 <quinq>	It's just a matter of how/where I can interact with it
May 10 10:11:11 <mcatanzaro>	quinq: You can also set your own GProxyResolver to get whatever proxy behavior you want, but that's complicated and I'm not sure if there is any simple documentation about how to do so. Never done it myself.
May 10 10:12:06 <quinq>	Well, I remember I had a quick look at it before 2.16 came out and saw that it would integrate proxy handling so didn't really got into it
May 10 10:12:14 <quinq>	But I will look again, thanks
May 10 10:22:01 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: ok
May 10 11:38:52 <quinq>	Another question while I'm at it, you provide webkit_web_context_allow_tls_certificate_for_host(), is there a way to revoque one of those?
May 10 11:57:43 <mcatanzaro>	There is no support for certificate revocation
May 10 11:58:34 <mcatanzaro>	Although... the networking backend is another extension point, so in theory you could rip that out in its entirety and do whatever you want there too. That would be a lot of work, but we got a bug report last week from someone who had accidentally done that by installing glib-openssl.
May 10 11:58:54 <quinq>	haha ok, thanks
May 10 12:02:05 <mcatanzaro>	quinq: See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=636573
May 10 12:02:31 <mcatanzaro>	Also, this incredible bug: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=781854
May 10 12:15:24 <quinq>	crazy
May 10 12:16:43 <quinq>	Just to be sure we understood each-other, I was just talking about removing the added certificate via webkit_web_context_allow_tls_certificate_for_host(), not using a whole global CRLs
May 10 12:24:03 <mcatanzaro>	quinq: Oh, that's completely different... um, I don't think there is a way to do that
May 10 12:24:28 <mcatanzaro>	You could file enhancement bugs for both of these, if it's something you would actually want to use in your application and not just a theoretical desire.
May 10 12:25:22 <quinq>	For now, it's just a theoretical one, so I'll wait to have a real need for it :)
May 10 13:06:47 <bitlord>	I see my bug 151349 is resolved, awesome, thanks!
May 10 13:46:15 <mcatanzaro>	Patience pays off... sometimes. :P
May 10 13:47:15 <annulen>	impatience is one of the three virtues of programmer :)

May 10 16:30:52 <Hhgrd009>	Are webkitgtk and webkitgtk2 still supported?
May 10 16:31:34 <quinq>	They're deprecated
May 10 16:33:07 <Hhgrd009>	So only webkit2gtk is still supported?
May 10 16:33:20 <quinq>	Yes, 2.14 and 2.16
May 10 16:33:57 <quinq>	(not really sure about 2.14 though, I'm not part of the project)
May 10 16:35:26 <Hhgrd009>	What again is the difference between the three? Isn't webkitgtk and webkitgtk2 just the original webkit to gtk2 and gtk3?
May 10 16:35:50 <grim>	they use the webkit1 api, where as webkit2gtk uses the webkit2 api
May 10 16:37:22 <Hhgrd009>	Ah, I'll be sure to avoid it if it says webkit rather than webkit2 because a lot of linux distros still keep the webkit1 ports for comparability reasons
May 10 16:37:47 <Hhgrd009>	*compatibility
May 10 16:39:07 <grim>	most of them are dropping it soon
May 10 16:39:27 <grim>	well they're starting to anyways
May 10 16:39:39 <Hhgrd009>	Very good
May 10 17:13:44 <aperezdc2>	xDDD
May 10 17:13:44 <aperezdc2>	mcatanzaro: Remember that type ahead unit test that was failing? Well, I fixed it, but there's so many changes locally in WebPopupMenuProxyGtk.cpp that now I have to figure out exactly what's the minimum amount of changes needed to make it pass
May 10 17:31:56 <mcatanzaro>	OK...
May 10 17:32:59 <aperezdc2>	well, actually no, I forgot to pass --force because the test is skipped
May 10 17:33:00 <aperezdc2>	so I was being enthusiastic due to a mistake
May 10 17:33:41 <mcatanzaro>	Happens
May 10 17:33:48 <aperezdc2>	thing is, everything works fine when testing manually e.g. in MiniBrowser, but then in the test the first attempt to typeahead works, the next ones don't
May 10 17:34:24 <aperezdc2>	and the WebPopupMenuProxyGtk is not even created after the first time
May 10 17:40:38 <aperezdc2>	on the other hand, I know how to fix the typeahead so it work with elements inside <optgroup>s
May 10 17:40:39 <aperezdc2>	...but I want to fix the test first, so I can add a test case
May 10 17:48:17 <aperezdc2>	meh, my brain is fried
May 10 17:48:18 <aperezdc2>	I surrender, tomorrow will be another battle

May 11 12:27:33 <quinq>	hi
May 11 12:28:05 <quinq>	My webkit keeps and old 301 in memory even though I restarted the client completely
May 11 12:28:17 <quinq>	(that's with stable version)
May 11 12:28:50 <quinq>	I even removed the cache dir, it still have the outdated redirection in memory
May 11 12:29:03 <quinq>	How is that possible and how would I solve the issue?
May 11 12:33:37 <quinq>	Is there some internal hardcoded timeout for it?
May 11 13:31:01 <clopez>	quinq: what do you mean with "an old 301" ?
May 11 13:32:40 <quinq>	Well, a 301 :)
May 11 13:32:51 <quinq>	(which isn't emitted anymore by the httpd)
May 11 13:33:03 <clopez>	i don't understand what keeping a 301 in memory means..
May 11 13:33:20 <quinq>	ok, example:
May 11 13:33:45 <quinq>	httpd gives a 301 to www.foo.bar when foo.bar is resquested
May 11 13:34:11 <quinq>	So I go once to foo.bar with webkit, it gets a 301 to www.foo.bar
May 11 13:34:15 <quinq>	I close the webkit process
May 11 13:34:36 <quinq>	I remove the 301 from the httpd and it'll serve directly foo.bar
May 11 13:35:00 <quinq>	I open a new webkit process and go to foo.bar, it still redirects automatically to www.foo.bar
May 11 13:35:48 <annulen>	probably it's written to disk cache
May 11 13:35:49 <clopez>	can you reproduce that if you set a temporal home, for example by exporting the environment variable HOME=$(mktemp -d) before starting the webkit process and removing the 301?
May 11 13:36:08 <quinq>	annulen, I removed the cache directory when testing
May 11 13:36:31 <clopez>	what says curl ? are you sure the server is not longer replying a 301 ?
May 11 13:36:40 <quinq>	curled worked as expected
May 11 13:36:43 <quinq>	*curl
May 11 13:36:54 <quinq>	Yes I'm sure, I did the check
May 11 13:36:59 <clopez>	then webkit should work also if you set a temporal HOME (to avoid any cache)
May 11 13:38:11 <quinq>	Ah you're right, I realize now I removed the wrong cache dire
May 11 13:38:16 <quinq>	directory
May 11 13:39:07 <quinq>	But it works now as expected with the same cache dir as before, has the 301 timedout?
May 11 13:39:40 <annulen>	it has cache control headers like a normal responce
May 11 13:40:19 <clopez>	301 is permanently redirection.. i'm unsure if cache control headers apply to that
May 11 13:41:31 <clopez>	quinq: if you want to have a temporal redirection you should not use a 301, but the code for a temporal redirect.. 307 maybe?
May 11 13:41:47 <annulen>	A 301 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls
May 11 13:41:47 <annulen>	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.2
May 11 13:42:31 <quinq>	clopez, the goal wasn't to have a temporary redirection, I just messed with my httpd and gave a wrong 301 :)
May 11 13:42:42 <annulen>	but yeah 307 is better
May 11 13:45:04 <quinq>	Yes, removing the cache forgets about the 301
May 11 14:01:16 <quinq>	Humm, I must have messed with my tests, I see that webkit sets the default 301 validity (in absence of Control-Cache header) to a full year
May 11 14:01:21 <quinq>	Sorry for the noise :)
May 11 14:01:48 <quinq>	(but I have my anwser about default timeout)

May 15 14:03:26 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169269
May 16 09:59:18 <aperezdc2>	So, I was reading about -webkit-system-font, and I was thinking it might be a nice thing to support. If we had that, for example Epiphany's overview could use that instead of hardcoding Cantarell, and font used in the overview would follow the system-wide GTK+ application font setting
May 16 10:03:40 *	aperezdc2 might make a patch for that
May 16 10:31:36 <mcatanzaro>	Adrián 🎩: Please ask Myles if that was ever standardized!
May 16 12:11:40 <MonkeyofDoom>	aperezdc2: +1
May 16 12:15:36 <annulen>	aperezdc2: that's easy, but I don't know if it makes much sense to use different fonts for default page text and UI controls
May 16 12:19:45 <aperezdc2>	I was thinking that it might make sense to use `font: menu` in the CSS for the Epiphany overview
May 16 12:19:54 <aperezdc2>	that value is already specced in https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/#propdef-font
May 16 12:21:32 <annulen>	indeed
May 16 17:48:40 <lufimtse>	Hello. Could someone advise me how do I get the HTML text from a webpage?  (I tried webkit_web_resource_get_data(..), but I get an "assertion 'WEBKIT_IS_WEB_RESOURCE(resource)' failed"
May 16 21:38:55 <aussiejames>	Hi all, I asked this question the other day but had to leave the chat before I saw an answer - is someone able to point me to the best place to troubleshoot this potential webkitgtk bug? https://github.com/uzbl/uzbl/issues/292
May 16 21:41:05 <mcatanzaro>	aussiejames: If you can reproduce with 2.16.2 then the best place would be to file a bug on bugs.webkit.org. Nobody is supporting 2.4 anymore so you're on your own for that, sorry.
May 16 21:41:38 <aussiejames>	Thanks mcatanzaro, it seems like there's no official packages for anything newer :(
May 16 21:48:08 <mcatanzaro>	aussiejames: Every mainstream distro has packages... it will be named something different for compatibility, since the WebKit1 API was removed
May 16 21:48:32 <aussiejames>	Yeah, I've been looking at: https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libwebkitgtk-3.0-0
May 16 21:48:51 <aussiejames>	which appears to be built on 2.4.9
May 16 21:48:53 <mcatanzaro>	aussiejames: FYI: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1375843
May 16 21:49:27 <aussiejames>	Oh, thanks!
May 16 21:53:23 <aussiejames>	Seems like only the experimental release of debian has 2.16 packages.
May 16 21:53:48 <aussiejames>	I'll try with stretch and see how I go .. it's built on 2.14
May 16 22:43:51 <aussiejames>	Sadly uzbl doesn't seem to find the webkit2 header file when trying to make

May 18 04:17:32 <quinq>	Is there a way to get a permission request type enum?
May 18 04:17:49 <quinq>	I'm trying to switch on them in the permission-request signal
May 18 04:18:46 <quinq>	I found per-permission type macros (like WEBKIT_TYPE_*_PERMISSION_REQUEST) but that's less handy
May 18 04:19:49 <quinq>	Sorry, I meant WEBKIT_IS_*_PERMISSION_REQUEST(obj)
May 18 04:21:50 <quinq>	I found webkit_permission_request_get_type(void) too, but it doesn't seem to be implemented, is it?

May 19 04:20:40 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos, do you know how can I force libsoup (SoupSession) to not use any cache?
May 19 04:20:59 <KaL>	tpopela: what cache do you mean?
May 19 04:21:20 <KaL>	tpopela: the disk cache is not used unless you get and configure the feature, I think
May 19 04:21:28 <KaL>	we no longer use it
May 19 04:22:11 <tpopela>	KaL, any cache :).. this has nothing to do with WebKit itself.. I'm using ./examples/get..
May 19 04:23:14 <KaL>	I don't know what other caches libsoup has, you can now avoid using cached credentials using the new message flag, for example
May 19 04:23:24 <KaL>	and you can force a new connection per message too
May 19 04:23:57 <tpopela>	KaL, ah the new message flag could help.. thanks :)
May 19 14:44:06 <laomaiweng>	Can I tell the WebKitCookieManager to not use any persistent storage at all? As in, only retain cookies in memory but never actually persist them to disk?
May 19 14:47:02 <laomaiweng>	(Hypothesis: the WebKitCookieManager has already been told once to persist cookies to file. I want to undo that.)
May 20 03:06:52 <hussam>	hi

May 20 03:27:54 <quinq>	hussam, whith what release model?
May 20 03:29:01 <hussam>	quinq: I'm not sure I understand the question but -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
May 20 03:38:46 <quinq>	Yes, that was the question
May 20 03:39:20 <quinq>	Are you building from release tarball or from git repo?
May 20 03:39:36 <quinq>	Because afaik Debug builds aren't supported from release tarballs (I also had the issue)
May 20 03:40:53 <hussam>	quinq: 2.16.2 tarball.
May 20 03:41:02 <quinq>	:)
May 20 03:42:38 <hussam>	quinq: ok, because I need to get a backtrace with webkit debug symbols for bug https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170003
May 20 03:44:14 <quinq>	I guess the only solution is to clone the repo…
May 20 03:46:26 <hussam>	I'll try with distribution buildflags first. Michael Catanzaro suggested this could be due to --as-needed LDFLAG. and I've been postponing this for the last month :)
May 20 03:49:52 <quinq>	iirc, last time I tried it was with empty user *FLAGS, but please tell-me if that actually solves the issue!
May 20 04:03:00 <hussam>	quinq: I think it helped.
May 20 04:03:45 <hussam>	It's at WebCore now. I think that's after javasciptcore.
May 20 04:05:35 <quinq>	oh
May 20 04:05:40 <quinq>	Thanks for the hint!

May 22 12:55:30 <ManDay>	I went to 2.17.3 and pictures are sometimes 100% broken (as in: wrongly decoded, only stripes and noise)
May 22 14:06:05 <ManDay>	I think it's some GL issue...
May 22 14:07:05 <ManDay>	and I think it only happens with CSS background: images - but I'm not sure
May 22 14:07:36 <ManDay>	and the artefacts look different every time
May 22 14:37:03 <keis>	hey, so I think I got something that looks like a fix for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161187
May 22 14:37:14 <keis>	could someone give some guidance on how to submit a patch?

May 22 14:38:32 <keis>	ty
May 22 15:10:01 <keis>	do I need to ping reviewers somehow or this end up in a queue automagically?
May 22 15:15:24 <annulen>	keis: it's always better to add relevant people
May 22 15:19:11 <keis>	right. plucking emails from the `git blame` or is there a tool for that?

May 23 11:27:29 <ManDay>	Does anyone share my troubles with 2.17.3 thoroughly breaking pictures and being very messed up generally with rendering?
May 23 11:38:55 <ManDay>	Well I made a bug
May 23 11:39:29 <ManDay>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172502
May 23 11:41:00 <annulen>	you should add to the title that it's wayland-specific
May 23 11:42:52 <ManDay>	annulen: Frankly I can't tell
May 23 11:45:14 <annulen>	this may have something to do with recent changes related to threaded decoding of images, however I haven't yet investigated when this work was done
May 23 11:46:44 <ManDay>	it sounds most plausible, since it happens sporadically and randomly like a race
May 24 06:50:06 <ManDay>	I can't possibly hope that someone has committed the capability to download "blobs" anywhere already?
May 24 06:57:00 <annulen>	use qtwebkit, we have blob downloads :)
May 24 07:00:28 <quinq>	But do you provide C bindings? :/
May 24 07:00:39 <annulen>	nah
May 24 07:08:30 <ManDay>	annulen: gtk is in my venes
May 24 07:09:36 <annulen>	hehe
May 24 07:36:25 <KaL>	ManDay: blob downloads are supported, if they don't work it's a bug
May 24 07:36:54 <ManDay>	KaL: I have tried multiple pages and they don't work anywhere
May 24 07:37:18 <ManDay>	Have you tried in MiniBrowser? Here is another https://sketch.io/sketchpad/
May 24 07:37:26 <annulen>	KaL: what code handles them?
May 24 07:37:43 <ManDay>	I get the same "Load request cancelled" messa
May 24 07:37:45 <ManDay>	ge
May 24 07:38:33 <KaL>	I don't know but I've seen layout tests for blob downloads while gardening, or maybe I'm wrong and it's a different feature

Jun 01 10:03:09 <berto>	that's why it builds
Jun 01 10:03:15 <berto>	it's a VM

Jun 03 10:10:06 <lantw44>	Is it possible to use WebKit2 API to read values of HttpOnly cookies?
Jun 03 10:12:02 <quinq>	lantw44, have a look at webkit_website_data_manager_fetch()
Jun 03 10:13:49 <quinq>	Humm, my webview shows “URL cannot be shown” when I click on a mailto: href, how (where) should I handle those?

Jun 03 10:15:34 <lantw44>	but I want to access the values of cookies
Jun 03 10:21:01 <quinq>	Another solution would be to webkit_cookie_manager_set_persistent_storage() and then parse the file (or query the db)
Jun 03 10:28:48 <lantw44>	quinq: but the inspector shows Expires=Session, which means it will be deleted when the browser is closed.
Jun 03 10:29:26 <lantw44>	Will this kind of cookies get written to disk?
Jun 03 10:39:43 <quinq>	not sure :/
Jun 03 10:40:52 <lantw44>	quinq: I called webkit_cookie_manager_set_persistent_storage in my code, but I could not find session cookies in the file.
Jun 03 10:41:10 <lantw44>	Only non-session cookies got written to it.
Jun 03 10:43:28 <quinq>	ok, you'll have to wait for somebody else's answer then :)
Jun 03 10:43:59 <quinq>	I'm interested in the answer too
Jun 03 11:08:45 <lantw44>	It seems that it is possible to see headers of HTTP responses by connecting to "notify::response" and "sent-request" signal of WebKitWebResource
Jun 03 11:10:03 <lantw44>	Set-Cookie header can be found in WebKitURIResponse object passed to "send-request" handler or "response" property
Jun 03 11:19:03 <lantw44>	I still hope there is a better way to access cookies ...
Jun 04 11:08:49 <quinq>	Hi, is it possible somewhat to use getClientRects (or getBoundingClientRect) from the webkitdom API?

Jun 05 09:26:10 <matzipan>	I guess at this point it's not worth investing in wk1, since it's going away anyway
Jun 05 09:28:30 <annulen>	wk1 is just a thin layer on top of webcore, there is nothing wrong with it and IMO it's more suitable for things like email clients
Jun 05 09:29:52 <annulen>	as for your original question, I'd go for view per message
Jun 05 09:30:00 <annulen>	all views share resources
Jun 05 09:31:47 <matzipan>	"It’s very unfortunate that a large number of applications still depend on WebKitGTK+ 2.4 — I count 41 such packages in Fedora — but this old version of WebKit is affected by over 200 known vulnerabilities and really has to go sooner rather than later. We’ve agreed to remove WebKitGTK+ 2.4 and its dependencies from Fedora rawhide right after Fedora 26 is branched next month, so they will no
Jun 05 09:31:53 <matzipan>	longer be present in Fedora 27 (targeted for release in November). "
Jun 05 09:31:57 <matzipan>	This is from Michael's article in February
Jun 05 09:32:28 <matzipan>	oh okay, so they're not entirely independent instances
Jun 05 09:32:41 <annulen>	yes, gtk port dropped wk1 long ago
Jun 05 09:34:21 <matzipan>	I might look in creating the views on demand, as opposed to opening them all at the beginning, but any pointers about how I could speed this up?
Jun 05 09:35:02 <annulen>	creating empty view should be cheap
Jun 05 09:35:16 <annulen>	it's loading content that might take longer
Jun 05 09:35:54 <matzipan>	to be fair, I'm doing everything synchronously right now
Jun 05 09:36:05 <annulen>	you may want to prevent situation when there is no view alive, to prevent webprocess from shutting down
Jun 05 09:37:51 <matzipan>	that does sound plausible
Jun 05 09:48:39 <matzipan>	Thanks annulen, I'll have a look later today and will report back
Jun 05 09:53:02 <quinq>	Humm, are webkit extensions forked from the main process? ie: can I pass to it one end of a socketpair to communicate between the main thread and the webext?
Jun 05 09:53:47 <annulen>	web extension runs in WebProcess, your host application is UIProcess
Jun 05 09:54:05 <quinq>	So they are completely distinct?
Jun 05 09:54:25 <quinq>	How to communicate between both?
Jun 05 09:54:33 <annulen>	there is IPC
Jun 05 09:54:36 <quinq>	(please don't say dbus)
Jun 05 09:54:55 <annulen>	it can pass all kinds of things, but I have no idea what GTK port exposes in public API
Jun 05 09:55:07 <annulen>	IPC is binary protocol over AF_UNIX
Jun 05 09:58:13 <quinq>	annulen, hence socketpair ;)
Jun 05 10:34:11 <hussam>	hi. I'm compiling webkitgtk+ with the patch from bug 170003. with gcc7, it keeps saying warning: this use of "defined" may not be portable [-Wexpansion-to-defined] every second.
Jun 05 10:34:21 <hussam>	is there any way to quiet this warning?
Jun 05 10:35:44 <annulen>	hussam: r217618
Jun 05 10:36:12 <annulen>	or just append -Wno-expansion-to-defined to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
Jun 05 10:37:35 <hussam>	ok, thanks annulen.
Jun 05 10:38:24 <matzipan>	you can do IPC over anything you want. Dbus can be one ofthem
Jun 05 10:38:57 <matzipan>	But I'm curious, what makes you hesitant about dbus? It's quite elegant to use at least in Vala.
Jun 05 10:40:36 <annulen>	it might be elegant to use, but protocol it self is a piece of crap, and a clear overkill when you don't need message bus, but just connect two peers
Jun 05 10:41:54 <quinq>	You speak my mind, annulen
Jun 05 10:42:14 <annulen>	also, it doesn't seem wise to use one more IPC mechanism in addition to WK2's
Jun 05 10:43:09 <quinq>	Well, there's no WK2 IPC between UI and Web
Jun 05 10:43:24 <quinq>	Or maybe I missed it
Jun 05 10:43:48 <annulen>	if there was no IPC, it couldn't work at all :P
Jun 05 10:44:35 <quinq>	Nothing exposed
Jun 05 10:45:17 <quinq>	I'd be glad to reuse any existing IPC if possible
Jun 05 10:46:02 <annulen>	I'm afraid you'll need to contribute patches
Jun 05 10:46:39 <quinq>	I don't code C++ :/
Jun 05 10:46:42 <keis>	quinq: in uzbl we added a dirty IPC over pipe() to the web extensions
Jun 05 10:46:56 <matzipan>	but the protocol is sort of transparent to you anyway...
Jun 05 10:47:10 <quinq>	keis, I did that a few years ago, it ended up in something horrible
Jun 05 10:48:09 <quinq>	keis, you mean you're able to pass fd's between UIprocess and Webprocess?
Jun 05 10:48:25 <keis>	it's the same basic mechanism as any ipc
Jun 05 10:48:47 <quinq>	Or did you use named pipes
Jun 05 10:48:52 <keis>	yeah, you can inherit the fd from the ui process
Jun 05 10:49:11 <quinq>	Because annulen just told me those were separated process so no fd inheritage
Jun 05 10:49:16 <quinq>	ahhhh…
Jun 05 10:49:43 <quinq>	Better
Jun 05 10:50:16 <annulen>	I wou;dn't rely on inherited fd's because webprocess may be restarted
Jun 05 10:51:00 <keis>	but what would restart that if not the parent process?
Jun 05 10:51:19 <annulen>	indeed

Jun 12 12:26:08 <quinq>	hi :)
Jun 12 12:27:00 <quinq>	Is there a solid way I would have missed to detect when there is a change of page, from a webkitextension?
Jun 12 12:31:03 <KaL>	quinq: what do you mean by a change of page? a navigation?
Jun 12 12:31:23 <quinq>	yes
Jun 12 12:31:43 <KaL>	quinq: you can monitor WebKitWebPage:uri property, I think
Jun 12 12:31:54 <KaL>	connecting to notify::uri signal
Jun 12 12:31:56 <quinq>	I was using the document-loaded signal, but it's not triggered on history navigation
Jun 12 12:32:36 <quinq>	KaL, I think it's too early, my goal is to get the DOM document
Jun 12 12:32:54 <KaL>	window-object-cleared
Jun 12 12:33:29 <quinq>	Will I get this on history too?
Jun 12 12:33:53 <quinq>	Good idea anyway, let-me try that, thanks :)
Jun 12 12:34:29 <KaL>	I think so
Jun 12 12:35:28 <KaL>	maybe document-loaded should also be emitted when restoring a page from the history cache
Jun 12 12:37:20 <quinq>	That would help me, but I think “loaded” implies networking in the current API
Jun 12 12:38:08 <KaL>	I think I've discussed this in the past with apple devs, but I don't remember
Jun 12 12:38:35 <quinq>	(for example the Setting auto-load-images is only checked when there is an actual network load, not on history navigation)
Jun 12 12:38:54 <quinq>	ok
Jun 12 12:40:15 <quinq>	But I'd be glad if it was checked everytime :)
Jun 12 12:43:56 <quinq>	Is there a unique ScriptWorld per webprocess for different pages?
Jun 12 12:47:08 <KaL>	quinq: there's a default one, but the signal passes the page as parameter
Jun 12 12:47:45 <KaL>	and frame, because it's per frame too, you can check if it's the main frame, which is what you want
Jun 12 12:48:23 <quinq>	Yes, but I was asking regarding the connection to the object-cleared signal :)
Jun 12 12:48:39 <quinq>	(but I got my answer)
Jun 12 13:03:11 <quinq>	KaL, actually window-object-cleared isn't triggered on history navigation either
Jun 12 13:03:43 <quinq>	Which is strange, I wonder nobody reported this before
Jun 12 13:05:23 <KaL>	I'm surprised too
Jun 12 13:05:47 <KaL>	I wonder how the ephy overview works, for example when loaded from history cache
Jun 12 13:08:03 <quinq>	KaL, it looks like it's linked to navigation events
Jun 12 13:08:44 <quinq>	Surely from the UI over dbus
Jun 12 13:08:58 <quinq>	ephy_web_overview_model_urls_changed() in embed/web-extension/ephy-web-overview.c
Jun 14 12:57:00 <Tirifto>	Hello all!
Jun 14 12:59:17 <Tirifto>	I'm trying to compile webkit2gtk on Parabola (Arch Linux derivative), but it fails to check the signatures because of unknown public key. Is my understanding right that I first need to import the packager's key from somewhere, and if so, then where can I find it?
Jun 14 13:07:10 <quinq>	Tirifto, ask parabola
Jun 15 03:54:44 <berto>	Trevinho: the signatures are here https://webkitgtk.org/releases/
Jun 15 03:54:58 <berto>	the public key should be in the usual public key repositories
Jun 15 03:55:57 <berto>	https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0xD7FCF61CF9A2DEAB31D81BD3F3D322D0EC4582C3&op=vindex
Jun 15 11:29:43 <sideca>	Hi, I've been having a major headache trying to get webkitgtk working with a Java application (Pentaho Spoon).  Every time I open a new dialog box from the base application it appears as blank.
Jun 15 11:30:16 <sideca>	I'm using the version of webkitgtk that ships with my version of Red Hat (6.5 64-bit):  webkitgtk-1.2.6-5.el6.x86_64
Jun 15 11:30:59 <sideca>	Originally the only error message that was showing was the following:
Jun 15 11:31:12 <sideca>	https://thepasteb.in/p/r0hwJLy8zXrfK
Jun 15 11:33:24 <sideca>	webkitgtk-1.4 provides the required library (libwebkitgtk-1.0), whoever if I use that version of webkitgtkt the Java application refuses to launch with a fatal JVM crash.
Jun 15 11:34:48 <sideca>	Therefore I stuck with webgtk-1.2.  I copied the library (/usr/lib64/libwebkitgtk-1.0.so.0.7.3) whilst 1.4 was installed.and manually linked the library successfully:
Jun 15 11:35:07 <sideca>	[root@FW1AE1-PTHo1 data-integration]# ldconfig -p | grep webkitgtk-1.0
Jun 15 11:35:07 <sideca>	        libwebkitgtk-1.0.so.0 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/libwebkitgtk-1.0.so.0
Jun 15 11:35:57 <sideca>	This left the application 100% error free.  However the problem still persists and I have no clue what I'm missing.
Jun 15 11:36:24 <sideca>	Is this a familiar scenario for anyone?  Any ideas please?
Jun 15 11:36:30 <annulen>	is this commercial application? if yes, better ask those who sold it to you
Jun 15 11:36:55 <sideca>	No, it's the Community Edition
Jun 15 11:37:11 <annulen>	do they support rhel 6?
Jun 15 11:37:45 <annulen>	did you install binaries or compiled from source?
Jun 15 11:38:10 <sideca>	I believe so, will double check.
Jun 15 11:38:18 <sideca>	Installed from binaries.
Jun 15 11:38:41 <annulen>	it may sound stupid to compile java app, but there must be jni or smth like that to interact with libwebkitgtk, and issue may be in ABI incompatibility
Jun 15 11:40:34 <sideca>	The commercial version definitely supports RHEL 6 64-bit
Jun 15 11:41:08 <sideca>	I guess I can give compiling the java app a go.  Haven't explored that path yet.
Jun 15 18:13:46 <sideca>	thanks for your help annulen - have set up ant and am working through issues building the source.
Jun 16 09:20:51 <quinq>	Hi
Jun 16 09:21:54 <quinq>	Whith enable-write-console-messages-to-stdout true, while emitting a non-ascii character, I get unproper encoding
Jun 16 09:22:43 <quinq>	ie: if I type in the Console from the inspector: console.log("→");
Jun 16 09:23:00 <quinq>	On my terminal I can see: CONSOLE LOG â
Jun 16 09:23:30 <quinq>	My locale is UTF-8 (and default charset on webkit is set to UTF-8 too, but I doubt this is related anyway)
Jun 16 09:23:39 <quinq>	Is there something I am missing?
Jun 16 09:25:10 <annulen>	quinq: it might be that font taht you use in terminal doesn't have →
Jun 16 09:25:28 <quinq>	nope
Jun 16 09:25:31 <annulen>	or that enable-write-console-messages-to-stdout
Jun 16 09:25:34 <annulen>	corrupts output
Jun 16 09:25:56 <quinq>	How do you mean?
Jun 16 09:26:11 <annulen>	by using latin1
Jun 16 09:26:18 <quinq>	Yes, that was my point :)
Jun 16 09:26:23 <annulen>	insted of utf8
Jun 16 09:26:29 <quinq>	Indeed
Jun 16 09:27:06 <annulen>	if you find the code that performs output I can tell how to fix
Jun 16 09:27:13 <quinq>	Do you know if it's a know issue?
Jun 16 09:27:38 <annulen>	no idea
Jun 16 09:27:49 <quinq>	You know how to fix it, but not where it's done?
Jun 16 09:36:10 <quinq>	Looks like it's in JavaScriptCore/runtime/ConsoleClient.cpp anyway
Jun 16 09:36:20 <quinq>	printConsoleMessage
Jun 16 09:41:49 <annulen>	indeed, and it uses utf8
Jun 16 09:45:39 <quinq>	Yeah? How do you see that?
Jun 16 09:45:57 <annulen>	WTFLogAlways("%s", builder.toString().utf8().data());
Jun 16 09:46:05 <quinq>	Yeah but
Jun 16 09:46:34 <quinq>	ah nevermind, I thought WTF was another logging facility and the actual message was written out before that
Jun 16 09:47:10 <quinq>	So the issue is somewhere else
Jun 16 09:49:25 <quinq>	annulen, aren't you able to reproduce the issue?
Jun 16 09:51:31 <annulen>	it reproduces in gtk port and doesn't reproduce in qt
Jun 16 09:51:38 <annulen>	weird
Jun 16 09:52:14 <KaL>	libxml2 version maybe? it could be a problem with the parser
Jun 16 09:52:21 <annulen>	same
Jun 16 09:52:30 <KaL>	weird, then
Jun 16 10:52:05 <annulen>	quinq: sorry, printConsoleMessageWithArguments wasn't used in Qt port. When it's used, same thing happens
Jun 16 10:57:15 <annulen>	quinq: https://0x0.st/lP8.txt
Jun 16 10:57:21 <annulen>	proposed fix
Jun 16 10:57:56 <annulen>	when builder gets char* it assumes latin1
Jun 16 11:10:04 <quinq>	thanks annulen

Jun 16 15:03:14 <sideca>	I tried building the Pentaho Spoon Java app from source.
Jun 16 15:03:25 <sideca>	Built successfully
Jun 16 15:03:43 <sideca>	Although ran out of disk space whilst I was at lunch :(
Jun 16 15:04:11 <sideca>	There was no improvement with either the WebKitGTK nor the Mozilla renderers
Jun 16 15:04:33 <sideca>	Will see if that's still the case in a few hours once the build has completed.
Jun 16 17:10:08 <sideca>	Hi annulen
Jun 16 17:10:19 <sideca>	Just finished rebuilding the source.
Jun 16 17:10:29 <sideca>	Still the problem continues :(

Jun 19 14:11:16 <hussam>	Anyone else seeing tearing in gmail.com after you open a chat dialog in 2.17.4?
Jun 20 00:31:03 <zutt>	hussam: i see it on 2.16.3 already
Jun 20 03:41:56 <KaL>	tpopela: is r217650 also needed in 2.16 branch?
Jun 20 03:57:35 <tpopela>	KaL, you can put it there, but JSC will crash without https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132333 and that's not reviewed.. but include it there.. one less patch to include downstream..
Jun 20 04:38:39 <tpopela>	yusukesuzuki, Hi Yusuke, do you have a minute to discuss one of your changes?
Jun 20 04:40:38 <yusukesuzuki>	tpopela: sure,!but plz wait. I'm now out of office. I'll back 20 mins later ;)
Jun 20 04:40:58 <tpopela>	yusukesuzuki, no problem, I will wait :)
Jun 20 05:05:49 <yusukesuzuki>	tpopela: ok, what happens?
Jun 20 05:10:08 <tpopela>	yusukesuzuki, after your changes with machine context WebKit is not buildable on ppc64, ppc64le, ppc, s390, s390x (all on linux) due to some missing implementations.. As these arches are using glibc is something like this enough - https://da.gd/BAqBf ? Or there needs to be more done? With ppc there is a tricky thing that it doesn't have IP, so I'm still not sure about what to do, but I will ask our ppc guys..
Jun 20 05:11:34 <tpopela>	yusukesuzuki, or I'm just overlooking something and there is some implementation that just needs to be turned on? (without the specific implementation for various arches)..
Jun 20 05:12:21 <tpopela>	yusukesuzuki, also all the mentioned arches are using only CLoop..
Jun 20 05:13:00 <yusukesuzuki>	hmmm, can I have a build failure log? I think they should be buildable without these implementations.
Jun 20 05:13:05 <yusukesuzuki>	If it uses CLoop.
Jun 20 05:14:06 <tpopela>	yusukesuzuki, the first failure is about missing:
Jun 20 05:14:08 <tpopela>	../../Source/WTF/wtf/threads/Signals.cpp: In function ‘void WTF::jscSignalHandler(int, siginfo_t*, void*)’:
Jun 20 05:14:08 <tpopela>	../../Source/WTF/wtf/threads/Signals.cpp:322:97: error: ‘registersFromUContext’ was not declared in this scope
Jun 20 05:14:08 <tpopela>	     PlatformRegisters& registers = registersFromUContext(reinterpret_cast<ucontext_t*>(ucontext));
Jun 20 05:15:02 <tpopela>	and indeed there is not definition in vi Source/WTF/wtf/PlatformRegisters.h
Jun 20 05:15:19 <yusukesuzuki>	ah, ok.
Jun 20 05:15:25 <tpopela>	because that machine doesn't have machine_context..
Jun 20 05:20:46 <yusukesuzuki>	we should fix Signals.cpp instead.
Jun 20 05:25:23 <tpopela>	yusukesuzuki, ok, that's your turn as that's a black box for me ;)
Jun 20 05:25:41 <yusukesuzuki>	tpopela: I'll upload a patch fixing it...
Jun 20 05:26:13 <tpopela>	yusukesuzuki, if you want to try it, just let me know!
Jun 20 05:31:00 <yusukesuzuki>	tpopela: can you try it? https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173590
Jun 20 05:33:10 <yusukesuzuki>	tpopela: JSC should be built without this MACHINE_CONTEXT feature. And thus, it should be buildable under PPC or other platforms.
Jun 20 05:34:24 <yusukesuzuki>	tpopela: but, if we have MACHINE_CONTEXT implementation, JSC can enable some more optimized things. So, if you interested in enabling it in some environment, writing MachineContext::xxx features in these environment is also good.
Jun 20 05:37:12 <tpopela>	yusukesuzuki, honestly as a package maintainer I'm glad that it will build there.. :).. there are more fundamental changes that needs to be fixed as CLoop is crashing without https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132333 as fpizlo said this is just a small fix workarounding some big changes that needs to be addressed..
Jun 20 05:37:38 <tpopela>	yusukesuzuki, the patch works.. thanks! jsconly is build on ppc64 :)
Jun 20 05:38:04 <yusukesuzuki>	tpopela: thank you for trying it!
Jun 20 05:38:19 <tpopela>	yusukesuzuki, I will note it in the patch.
Jun 20 05:38:24 <tpopela>	grr bugzilla..
Jun 20 05:43:04 <tpopela>	KaL, thank you for the review!
Jun 20 07:52:40 *	KaL has changed the topic to: WebKitGTK+ stable: 2.16.4, unstable: 2.17.4 | Homepage: http://webkitgtk.org/ |  http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTK/2.14.x | https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTK/2.16.x | "HTML is useful for a web content rendering engine."
Jun 22 06:58:53 <hussam>	2.17.4 is not affected by https://webkitgtk.org/security/WSA-2017-0005.html, correct?
Jun 22 07:02:04 <annulen>	hussam: odd release series (like 2.17.x) are made from trunk, and trunk is always (believed to be) totally secure
Jun 22 20:28:35 <federico1>	zaitor: around?
Jun 23 10:12:06 <antoyo>	Can someone look at this issue (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173502), please? IMHO, it is a major issue.
Jun 23 10:13:04 <annulen>	when reporting crash, it's better to attach backtrace as well
Jun 23 10:14:03 <antoyo>	Hum, is it useful even when I don't have debug symbols?
Jun 23 10:14:21 <annulen>	quite possible
Jun 23 10:17:11 <antoyo>	Here's the backtrace (I cannot post it in the thread right now):

Jun 23 10:20:07 <antoyo>	Do I create issues correctly in the bug tracker? It seems nobody ever look at them until I post them in IRC.
Jun 23 10:20:18 <ebassi>	antoyo: It's kind of pointless, without debugging symbols
Jun 23 10:21:03 <antoyo>	ebassi: That's what I said before :) .
Jun 23 10:21:21 <ebassi>	Well, you caught me: I didn't read the whole backlog ;-)
Jun 23 10:21:45 <antoyo>	Are you able to reproduce the issue?
Jun 23 10:23:25 <ebassi>	Yes, I can
Jun 23 10:24:12 <ebassi>	But I don't have a debug build of everything
Jun 23 11:47:59 <federico1>	zaitor: hey!  thanks for the quick update to 2.16.4
Jun 23 11:49:19 <antoyo>	federico1: from Mexico?
Jun 23 11:49:34 <federico1>	antoyo: yes
Jun 23 11:49:46 <antoyo>	I wasn't sure if it was you :) .
Jun 23 11:50:08 <federico1>	antoyo: we had a Rust Day MX last weekend - missed you there :)
Jun 23 11:50:20 <federico1>	brson came
Jun 23 11:51:23 <antoyo>	Was it a day of talks?
Jun 23 11:52:15 <federico1>	yup
Jun 23 11:52:22 <federico1>	some talks, a couple of workshops
Jun 23 11:52:36 <federico1>	there were more people than I expected, which is a good sign
Jun 23 11:52:37 <antoyo>	That would have been great, but I'm not fluent in spanish :D .
Jun 23 11:52:55 <federico1>	we had simultaneous translation for the english talks!
Jun 23 11:53:00 <federico1>	it was pretty well organized
Jun 23 11:53:14 <federico1>	antoyo: do you remember sebasmagri?  his company hosted it
Jun 23 11:53:20 <antoyo>	Cool.
Jun 23 11:53:37 <antoyo>	Yes, I remember all of you.
Jun 23 11:53:53 <antoyo>	So, you work on webkit2gtk?
Jun 23 12:36:21 <kwm>	oh, new webkit release. /me grabs
Jun 23 13:45:13 <zaitor>	federico1: pure selfintrest :-)

Jun 27 06:34:14 <joanie>	kov: ping
Jun 27 06:34:46 <joanie>	kov: Please install libxkbcommon-x11-dev on your bot(s)
Jun 27 06:35:16 <joanie>	it's a new dependency, required by the new at-spi2 I bumped us to.
Jun 27 06:35:45 <joanie>	And without which bots will, apparently, go 1000 different shades of red (oops, mea culpa, etc.)
Jun 27 07:09:05 <joanie>	kov: related to the above, I've filed a bug regarding the bigger issue: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173871
Jun 27 07:11:10 <annulen>	fwiw, gtk bots are rarely green anyway :)
Jun 27 07:11:24 <kov>	joanie, done!
Jun 27 07:11:24 <joanie>	annulen: I didn't say it. ;)
Jun 27 07:11:32 <joanie>	kov: thanks!!! (and sorry)
Jun 27 07:11:44 <joanie>	I had been told "just add it to install-dependencies"
Jun 27 07:12:22 <kov>	well, they're red but they're at least building and running tests which is more useful than failing to build for sure, so I think joanie's idea of running install-deps automatically is great
Jun 27 07:12:32 <annulen>	yep, sure
Jun 27 08:58:45 <heftig>	is using ninja instead of make for a complete build any faster?
Jun 27 09:14:11 <ebassi>	heftig: Yes
Jun 27 09:14:52 <heftig>	okay, thanks
Jun 27 09:15:32 <ebassi>	Even if you ignore the .NOTPARALLEL that cmake "helpfully" puts in the Makefile, and that would force you to run with -j1, the Makefile layout built by cmake is pretty poor and causes nested invocations of make
Jun 29 10:16:59 <ManDay>	I just came here to complain ;-(
Jun 29 10:17:29 <ManDay>	Webkit is being a real pain in the ass with resources. MiniBrowser eats all my CPU, constantly, my fan is working overtime. On almost every bloody page
Jun 29 10:17:36 <ManDay>	even with JS off
Jun 29 10:18:02 <annulen>	are you running trunk?
Jun 29 10:18:10 <ManDay>	almost
Jun 29 10:18:13 <ManDay>	2.17.4
Jun 29 10:19:11 <annulen>	if would be useful if you measured a profile with smth like perf or oprofile, and made a bug report
Jun 29 10:19:55 <ManDay>	okay i can do that. i suppose it needs symbols / "Debug" Cmake profile so I'll do it after the next build
Jun 29 10:20:05 <ManDay>	thanks
Jun 29 10:20:49 <annulen>	don't use debug build
Jun 29 10:20:57 <annulen>	instead, add -g to release flags
Jun 29 10:21:36 <annulen>	debug build will be much slower because of assertions and stuff like that
Jun 29 10:21:45 <annulen>	also you might hit assertion failure
Jun 29 10:22:14 <ManDay>	ah ok
Jun 29 10:22:39 <ManDay>	yeah when i first build webkit manually i accidentally didnt use release and immediately had performance problems :)
Jun 30 02:45:25 <saurabh_>	i want to know how to build and run Tools/TestWebkitApi
Jun 30 05:39:15 <annulen>	saurabh_: it's built by default
Jun 30 05:39:30 <annulen>	see bin/TestWebKitAPI
Jun 30 16:01:26 <hussam>	I noticed that wget stores a list of hsts preloaded websites as it uses them  + the duration then automatically redirects to https on second load.
Jun 30 16:01:35 <hussam>	does webkit have such a capability?
Jun 30 16:04:10 <hussam>	cat ~/.wget-hsts

Jul 13 06:13:33 <aidanh>	Hi all; is it possible to clear cached 301 redirects with the website data API?
Jul 13 06:16:05 <aidanh>	It looks like redirects get stored in the network cache, but I'm not sure if that maps to any of the defined website data types.

Aug 02 10:14:57 <annulen>	are you using correct -march flag?
Aug 02 10:15:30 <annulen>	are you building for aarch64?

Aug 02 10:45:52 <annulen>	RdlP: -march=
Aug 02 10:46:01 <annulen>	see man gcc
Aug 02 10:46:31 <annulen>	it can be right by default though, especially if you use toolchain specifically suirted for your device
Aug 02 10:47:02 <annulen>	if you build for aarch64 default should be fine
Aug 02 10:47:32 <annulen>	gcc -v shows you default arch
Aug 02 10:54:29 <RdlP>	annulen, I can see: --with-arch=armv6 --target=arm-linux-gnueabihf --enable-multiarch
Aug 02 10:54:35 <RdlP>	but not -march flag

Aug 02 10:55:54 <annulen>	RdlP: however, if you can it's better to switch to 64-bit
Aug 02 10:56:13 <annulen>	s/buy/by/ :)
Aug 02 10:58:30 <RdlP>	to switch to 64 I need to specify -march=aarch64?
Aug 02 10:59:00 <annulen>	I think you need different toolchain
Aug 02 10:59:22 <annulen>	and 64-bit kernel if you don't have it
Aug 02 11:06:22 <RdlP>	If i run uname -m
Aug 02 11:06:26 <RdlP>	raspberry pi tell me
Aug 02 11:06:31 <RdlP>	armv7l
Aug 02 11:06:43 <RdlP>	If I compile for this arch it should work, right?
Aug 02 11:07:20 <annulen>	yes
Aug 02 11:08:48 <annulen>	-mcpu=cortex-a53 may work too, see https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=144115&p=952479
Aug 02 11:14:24 <RdlP>	ok, and how can I set that flags if I use make to build webkitgtk?
Aug 02 11:17:59 <annulen>	just like with other software built with cmake
Aug 02 11:18:13 <annulen>	CMAKE_C_FLAGS. CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
Aug 02 11:34:03 <RdlP>	I am reading that in order to modify CMAKE_C_FLAGS I need to modify cmake files, this is, I can't modify that option via command option cmake, right?
Aug 02 11:35:18 <annulen>	no
Aug 02 11:35:28 <annulen>	you just pass -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=... to arguments
Aug 02 11:35:34 <annulen>	or set via ccmake
Aug 02 11:49:53 <RdlP>	so, I pass -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-maarch=armv7l o what?
Aug 02 12:18:56 <RdlP>	annulen, I change to -mcpu=cortex-a53 and I run cmake command and all fine, but when I run make
Aug 02 12:19:20 <RdlP>	I get errors like "Not Supported ARM architecture"
Aug 02 12:19:25 <RdlP>	this is the pastebin: https://pastebin.com/ULkWWedp
Aug 02 12:30:34 <annulen>	RdlP: try -march=armv7-a -mcpu=cortex-a53
Aug 02 12:45:38 <RdlP>	ok, it is compiling
Aug 02 12:45:47 <RdlP>	note: I am getting warnings

Aug 02 12:48:16 <annulen>	hmm
Aug 02 12:49:33 <annulen>	RdlP: -march=armv7-a -mtune=cortex-a53
Aug 02 12:50:23 <RdlP>	annulen, cancel the current compilation and try with above flags?
Aug 02 12:52:36 <annulen>	yep
Aug 02 12:56:56 <RdlP>	annulen, ok it seems that now it is fine
Aug 02 12:57:06 <RdlP>	I wait to the end of compilation

Aug 04 12:59:40 <brrian_>	hey folks
Aug 04 12:59:51 <brrian_>	any particular reason ENABLE_CANVAS_PATH is not on for GTK?
Aug 04 17:59:42 <brrian_>	easy r? https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175190
Aug 05 09:24:53 <muelli>	hrm. garnacho I wanted to talk to.
Aug 07 09:49:39 *	rishi discovers https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169130
Aug 07 10:15:10 <rishi>	I am wondering if the documentation for webkit_web_context_set_web_extensions_* and WebKitWebContext::initialize-web-extensions should be more explicit about what "before anything is loaded" and "when a new web process is about to be launched" means.
Aug 07 10:16:11 <rishi>	I had to dig through git and bugzilla to remind myself why g-o-a uses a non-default WebContext for its WebView.
Aug 07 10:17:28 <rishi>	Turns out that "initialize-web-extensions" doesn't work with the default context. Or at least that was the case in 2015, when the WebKit2 port was done. :)
Aug 07 15:21:39 <nikolasc>	hi
Aug 07 15:21:53 <nikolasc>	could someone help me?

Aug 09 19:23:50 <ffpure>	guys, is it possible to install GTK+ for python3 under Centos 7?
Aug 09 19:26:59 <f8l>	Sounds like a question for another channel.
Aug 10 04:41:23 <ManDay>	I've got a dilemma regarding bug 171161
Aug 10 04:42:27 <ManDay>	I can name a page on which this bug can be reproduced absolutely reliably (for me) - it seems the only one (for me) - but it illegally offers to watch movie streams of copyrighted movie
Aug 10 04:42:33 <ManDay>	Now what...
Aug 10 06:08:31 <aidanh>	ManDay: I'd suggest just making a throwaway account, even though I think the webkit devs would have better things to do than care about your browsing habits
Aug 10 06:13:18 <annulen>	ManDay: I think you may share it via PM with magomez
Aug 10 06:15:35 <magomez>	yeah ManDay, just send me a PM and I'll give it a look
Aug 10 06:18:34 <magomez>	or an email to magomez@igalia.com
Aug 10 06:20:15 <ManDay>	magomez: I sent you a query right now if that's all right
Aug 10 06:20:33 <magomez>	sure ManDay
Aug 10 06:27:40 <ManDay>	magomez: on that subject, i have gtk+-3.22.16 now - i suppose that's relevant
Aug 10 06:28:32 <ManDay>	(but this has remained an issue throughout multiple gtk versions)
Aug 10 15:54:53 <frettchen>	hi devs
Aug 10 15:55:28 <frettchen>	compilation of webkitgtk-2.17.90 in stucks in webaudio/AudioContext.h

Aug 12 09:48:19 <aidanh>	Hi all; is there any way to modify response headers?
Aug 12 09:50:07 <aidanh>	I'd like to be able to block JS on a per-response basis, as well as allow data URIs for image responses (so as to add a textured background to the single-image page)
Aug 13 10:53:47 <HP>	So I see gtk referred to as GTK+, GTK2, GTK3, GTK+2, and GTK+3 interchangeable. I'm confused, is GTK+2 and GTK+ the same thing?
Aug 13 10:57:44 <heftig>	HP: the project is named GTK+
Aug 13 10:57:59 <heftig>	people often omit the +, though
Aug 13 10:58:12 <heftig>	2 and 3 are different versions
Aug 13 10:59:12 <HP>	Wasn't webkitgtk compatible with both 2 and 3 and webkit2 only compatible with 3?
Aug 13 11:01:31 <heftig>	yes, webkit2gtk was only released for gtk3
Aug 13 11:02:21 <HP>	Thanks
Aug 13 11:03:22 <HP>	Thanks for clearing up that gtk+2 and gtk2 are the same thing
Aug 13 11:13:52 <HP>	Does webkitgtk even use the webkit1 API anymore?
