Jul 27 07:21:45 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos, you probably want this for Ephy - https://paste.fedoraproject.org/396245/46961841/ (I'm waiting on WK compilation to actually compile this patch)..
Jul 27 07:52:52 <KaL>	tpopela: file a bug report and attach the patch, please
Jul 27 07:57:51 <tpopela>	KaL, ok, will do! btw Is rego on PTO? I'm having some difficulties regarding to accommodation for hackfest (no response from Avenida on my mail)..
Jul 27 08:00:21 <KaL>	PTO?
Jul 27 08:04:15 <tpopela>	KaL, Paid Time Off - holidays..
Jul 27 08:04:35 <KaL>	ah, I don't know, let me check
Jul 27 08:16:55 <KaL>	tpopela: yes, it seems he is going to be off for a few days
Jul 27 08:17:09 <KaL>	tpopela: maybe calvaris can help you
Jul 27 08:17:40 <tpopela>	KaL, ok and thank you! :)
Jul 27 09:21:41 <calvaris>	tpopela: I think we'll handle the reservations later
Jul 27 09:21:57 <calvaris>	is there any reasons you are in a hurry?
Jul 27 09:22:54 <tpopela>	calvaris, Hi! :) nope, I just wanted to remove it from my TODO :).. Anyway lajava talked with them and they did not receive my mail..
Jul 27 09:23:35 <tpopela>	calvaris, also you know this year I'm really looking forward to your famous octopus ;)
Jul 27 09:23:48 <calvaris>	tpopela: dude, I became vegan
Jul 27 09:23:52 <calvaris>	:D
Jul 27 09:23:57 <calvaris>	not eating it anymore
Jul 27 09:23:59 <mcatanzaro>	Plot twist!
Jul 27 09:24:01 <tpopela>	calvaris, no way :D
Jul 27 09:24:07 <calvaris>	yes way
Jul 27 09:24:39 <calvaris>	but I guess somebody else will do it instead of me
Jul 27 09:26:39 <tpopela>	calvaris, wow.. ok, then you need to prepare something vegan ;)
Jul 27 09:27:49 <calvaris>	there will be vegan options as usual
Jul 27 09:29:22 <aperezdc>	pretty much anyone from Galicia can make some octopus, or when around the region know some place where to go eat it
Jul 27 09:30:01 <aperezdc>	:)
Jul 27 09:30:02 <mcatanzaro>	"yoon: pulpo!"
Jul 27 09:31:05 <tpopela>	aperezdc, I think that you are definitely right.. I was just trying to "pay my debts" as last time I went with joanie and others to the indian place.. ;)
Jul 27 09:31:09 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, :D:D
Jul 27 09:31:19 <aperezdc>	:-)
Jul 27 09:32:27 <calvaris>	tpopela: cool, I'll go to the indian this time
Jul 27 09:36:11 <tpopela>	btw guys do you know if there is any "tourists | pedestrians | good for running/walking" path from La Coruna do Santiago de Compostela?
Jul 27 09:44:54 <aperezdc>	tpopela: there's the “Camino Inglés” → https://www.followthecamino.com/camino_tours/camino-ingles
Jul 27 09:45:18 <aperezdc>	allegedly, it's the branch of the pilgrimage walkpath to Santiago followed by the people who arrived from the North by sea
Jul 27 09:45:37 <aperezdc>	Coruña→Santiago is “only” ~75 km
Jul 27 09:47:13 <aperezdc>	tpopela: you can also make it a bit shorter by picking a bus to Betanzos (which is a nice town to visit) and starting the walk from there
Jul 27 09:48:25 <tpopela>	aperezdc, thank you! I plan to run and 75 km is fine :)..
Jul 27 09:49:40 <aperezdc>	tpopela: you're welcome! there's probably other routes, but the good thing of following the pilgrim's route is that most (if not all) of the paths should be signalled, and also it passes through historical places which one can visit, and there's usually lodging along the route if needed/wanted
Jul 27 09:52:42 <calvaris>	tpopela: wow, running
Jul 27 09:53:20 <tpopela>	aperezdc, yes that will be super handy if it will be signaled (I hate to look to the phone/map too often ;))
Jul 27 09:57:27 <aperezdc>	tpopela: just follow the shell signs → https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=camino+de+santiago+señal ;-)
Jul 27 09:58:05 <tpopela>	aperezdc, so I'm trying to find the exact map, but I manage to found just one from Ferrol (referenced from https://www.followthecamino.com/trip/camino-ingles )
Jul 27 09:58:22 <tpopela>	aperezdc, nice :)
Jul 27 09:59:43 <aperezdc>	tpopela: this is a blog+podcast of some person who made it from Coruña → http://indietravelpodcast.com/spain/walking-camino-ingles/
Jul 27 10:00:22 *	aperezdc digs a bit more
Jul 27 10:01:06 <tpopela>	aperezdc, wow this looks superb..
Jul 27 10:04:59 <aperezdc>	tpopela: i've found this as well → https://www.caminodesantiago.me/wp-content/uploads/Camino-Ingles-with-maps-22-August-2012.pdf
Jul 27 10:06:19 <aperezdc>	searching in Spanish I've found GPX tracks here: http://www.rayyrosa.com/caminoingles/mapa-y-track
Jul 27 10:06:53 <aperezdc>	tpopela: direct link to the Coruña→Santiago GPX here → http://www.rayyrosa.com/wp-content/uploads/gpx/INGLES-variante-a-coruna.gpx
Jul 27 10:08:59 <aperezdc>	tpopela: probably there's a lot more of stuff in the official website made by the regional government → http://www.caminodesantiago.gal/en/inicio
Jul 27 10:09:18 <tpopela>	aperezdc, wow thank you again! this will be really helpful!
Jul 27 10:09:25 <aperezdc>	...and I'll leave it here, betcha that's enough to get you started :D

Jul 30 17:19:39 <hux>	getting an error while trying to build gnome app using jhbuild
Jul 30 17:19:41 <hux>	http://pastebin.com/9Z7KshjG
Jul 30 17:21:43 <mcatanzaro>	hux: Any chance that harfbuzz was built with a different C++ ABI than WebKit? What distro is this?
Jul 30 17:22:14 <hux>	ubuntu 16.04
Jul 30 17:23:39 <mcatanzaro>	You built harfbuzz with jhbuild? What version of GCC?
Jul 30 17:24:00 <mcatanzaro>	Wait why am I asking about harfbuzz, it's not anywhere in your paste
Jul 30 17:24:24 <mcatanzaro>	Seriously no clue why I thought of it, hm
Jul 30 17:24:51 <hux>	i am trying to build gnome-calendar
Jul 30 17:24:56 <hux>	gcc version 5.4.0 20160609
Jul 30 17:25:38 <mcatanzaro>	hux, any chance you upgraded from an older Ubuntu, and had used jhbuild previously? If so you've probably got a mix of C++ ABIs in your jhbuild environment. If not, I have no clue. :(
Jul 30 17:26:01 <mcatanzaro>	/home/huzaifa/jhbuild/install/lib/libpangoft2-1.0.so.0: undefined reference to `FcWeightToOpenType' <-- hm, that one is different, no C++ there
Jul 30 17:27:53 <hux>	i had a failed attempt at building another gnome-app using jhbuild recently
Jul 30 17:28:36 <mcatanzaro>	hux: Is it possible that jhbuild built fontconfig but not pango? It looks you might have multiple problems here, this is strange. :(
Jul 30 17:31:33 <hux>	should i ignore this error and continue to install?
Jul 30 17:31:46 <mcatanzaro>	hux: Nope, this is pretty fatal
Jul 30 17:32:09 <mcatanzaro>	You can add skip = ['WebKit'] to your jhbuildrc and try again; I'm pretty sure gnome-calendar does not need super recent WebKit
Jul 30 17:32:31 <mcatanzaro>	But I wonder if something else is going to fail... it might be worth deleting your jhbuild install directory and starting fresh
Jul 30 17:35:25 <hux>	mcatanzaro: ok starting afresh. Thanx
Aug 03 03:39:25 <mcrha>	hi KaL et al, maybe known, I do not know, but I'm at commit 0e55b186a of a WebKit git master checkout (git-svn-id: http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk@204076) and I cannot build it, it errors at: make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/xxd.pl', needed by 'DerivedSources/WebCore/InspectorOverlayPage.h'.  Stop.
Aug 03 03:39:56 <mcrha>	any advice?
Aug 03 03:40:45 <KaL>	hmm, I haven't updated today yet, and bots are building fine, so maybe it's a clean build issue
Aug 03 03:41:46 <KaL>	mcrha: I'll update and try a clean build
Aug 03 03:42:50 <mcrha>	KaL, I had some "very" old checkout (more than a month), that failed, thus I `git clean -xfd`, reconfigured, and still got this error
Aug 03 03:45:35 <mcrha>	KaL, I see the missing xxd.pl file at /Source/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/..., thus maybe only the path is wrong, or the configuration of it failed somehow
Aug 03 05:13:41 <tpopela>	mcrha, KaL clean build succeeded here..
Aug 03 05:25:37 <mcrha>	tpopela, what is 'clean build'? the `git clean -xfd` erases everything unknown in the git checkout, then I created a build/ subfolder, entered it and called `cmake ...`, then `make`. The build cannot be cleaner, I'm afraid.
Aug 03 05:27:04 <tpopela>	mcrha, clean build means cloning a git WebKit repo on a different machine, running Tools/Scripts/webkitgtk-update-libs and then running build-webkit --gtk --release
Aug 03 05:27:25 <tpopela>	mcrha, did you rm -rf WebKitBuild/Release ?
Aug 03 05:28:09 <mcrha>	tpopela, where is that directory, I do not have it in the WebKit root checkout
Aug 03 05:29:02 <tpopela>	mcrha, it is in the root checkout.. but only if you are using the WebKit build scripts (which you should use anyway (as I told you several times))..
Aug 03 05:29:49 <annulen>	mcrha: it's a default build dir of build-webkit, can be changed with WEBKIT_OUTPUTDIR variable
Aug 03 05:31:08 <mcrha>	okay, I do not have it, I call cmake manually, not through the "preferred way of building webkit"
Aug 03 05:32:19 <mcrha>	if I: `cp ../Source/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/* DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/`, then it starts building
Aug 03 05:32:45 <mcrha>	maybe the build-webkit does that in some way in the background; searching...
Aug 03 05:34:04 <mcrha>	ehm, `cp -r` is needed
Aug 03 05:34:17 <mcrha>	or not
Aug 03 05:34:34 <mcrha>	make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/builtins.py', needed by 'DerivedSources/WebCore/DOMWindowFetchBuiltins.cpp'.  Stop.
Aug 03 05:36:50 *	annulen never realized that Scripts get copied to ForwardingHeaders, that's amazing
Aug 03 05:38:49 <mcrha>	tpopela, do I checkout wrong branch?$ ls Tools/Scripts/webkitgtk-update-libs
Aug 03 05:38:49 <mcrha>	ls: cannot access 'Tools/Scripts/webkitgtk-update-libs': No such file or directory
Aug 03 05:39:12 <mcrha>	staying at git checkout root, of course
Aug 03 05:39:26 <tpopela>	mcrha, probably it is update-webkitgtk-libs
Aug 03 05:39:51 <mcrha>	right, that's there
Aug 03 05:40:26 <mcrha>	ble, jhbuild
Aug 03 06:22:45 <mcrha>	nah, it's all weird. I can `cmake ... && make stageSharedScripts && make`, but it fails later at:

Aug 03 06:36:09 <mcrha>	that will be something on my machine for sure, never mind and I'm sorry for bothering you with my own fault :-/

Aug 11 06:57:02 <CrazyLemon>	hey guys... does this look like webkitgtk bug https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/245 ?
Aug 11 06:59:21 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: Hrm. How much video memory do you have?
Aug 11 07:00:10 <CrazyLemon>	mrobinson well i have 7.4GB available ram..so integrated graphics is taking 512MB+ ?
Aug 11 07:00:20 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: Hrm.
Aug 11 07:00:45 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: It seems that even if you run out of video memory, your system shouldn't freeze...
Aug 11 07:01:00 <philn>	mrobinson: might be the IPC issues Carlos fixed recently?
Aug 11 07:01:17 <mrobinson>	philn: Do you have a link to those?
Aug 11 07:02:19 <philn>	i'd need to search in the git log
Aug 11 07:02:28 <CrazyLemon>	yea.. the freeze part is super annoying
Aug 11 07:02:43 <CrazyLemon>	SSH works but not really helpful since i can't kill webkit process
Aug 11 07:03:52 <annulen>	why?
Aug 11 07:04:30 <CrazyLemon>	process is/gets (?) defunct
Aug 11 07:05:31 <annulen>	kill -9?
Aug 11 07:05:39 <philn>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152316
Aug 11 07:05:52 <CrazyLemon>	-9 doesnt help..as i said you can't kill it :D
Aug 11 07:05:55 <CrazyLemon>	its a zombie process
Aug 11 07:08:14 <philn>	seems like a graphics driver issue, the patch i link above is more about fixing "too many files open" issues
Aug 11 07:11:26 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: Any sort of driver log could be helpful.
Aug 11 07:12:46 <CrazyLemon>	mrobinson i really hate freezing my system :D but yea..i'll give it a go and ssh into it a see what dmesg says about radeon
Aug 11 07:14:11 <CrazyLemon>	is this of any help https://paste.ubuntu.com/23013769/ ? this is currently in my dmesg
Aug 11 07:15:27 <annulen>	changing log level of kernel might help
Aug 11 07:16:38 <CrazyLemon>	so..level 8?
Aug 11 07:31:55 <CrazyLemon>	https://paste.ubuntu.com/23014217/ mrobinson is this helpful?
Aug 11 07:32:45 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: Does seem to be memory related somehow.
Aug 11 07:32:55 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: You don't see that at other times, do you?
Aug 11 07:33:19 <CrazyLemon>	mrobinson this is the first time i saw that msg
Aug 11 07:33:38 <CrazyLemon>	maybe had something to do with log level
Aug 11 07:34:42 <CrazyLemon>	but i have no issues other that with nuvola player/minibrowser & soundcloud
Aug 11 07:34:52 <CrazyLemon>	than*
Aug 11 08:45:26 <annulen>	by chance, is anybody aware of FTL crash fixes that are missing in 2.12 branch?

Aug 19 12:11:16 <JakeSays>	aperezdc: hey thanks!
Aug 19 13:25:11 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Somebody is complaining about a laggy WebKitWebView inside the GOA panel: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1367894
Aug 19 13:25:21 <rishi>	Have you seen this before?
Aug 19 13:25:23 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: Probably DRI3 + modesetting driver
Aug 19 13:25:35 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85064
Aug 19 13:25:41 <rishi>	Oh, right. I forgot about that.
Aug 19 13:25:42 <mcatanzaro>	There's a workaround in WebKitGTK+ 2.14
Aug 19 13:26:11 <rishi>	Do we enable DRI3 in Fedora?
Aug 19 13:26:14 *	rishi opens the bug
Aug 19 13:26:22 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: Yes, in some post-release F23 update
Aug 19 13:26:34 <annulen>	does 2.14 branch exist already?
Aug 19 13:28:26 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: I don't think so, no
Aug 19 13:28:54 <mcatanzaro>	It's (very slightly) late, probably KaL is busy. We've had no bugfix release since May either.
Aug 19 13:30:08 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: git grep LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE <- doesn't give me any hits. Tried both epiphany:f23 and epiphany:gnome-3-18. Makes me wonder why Ephy works fine with DDG.
Aug 19 13:30:16 <rishi>	Or did you mean F24 when you said "post-release F23 update"?
Aug 19 13:30:27 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: You are using the intel driver, this user is using the modesetting driver
Aug 19 13:30:40 <mcatanzaro>	I removed the LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE workaround some time after the Intel driver was fixed
Aug 19 13:30:52 <mcatanzaro>	Then after that, Fedora enabled the modesetting driver for some users with newer hardware
Aug 19 13:31:13 <rishi>	I see, ok.
Aug 19 13:31:29 <mcatanzaro>	At the time of that change, I complained that it would break WebKit, but nobody cared
Aug 19 13:31:34 *	mcatanzaro shrugs
Aug 19 13:31:48 <rishi>	I don't know the difference between modesetting and Intel drivers, except that the later is possibly used for Intel hardware. :)
Aug 19 13:32:06 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: KaL found the workaround after he noticed that in 2.14 *every* page was affected
Aug 19 13:32:27 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: I don't understand it either, but the intel driver is apparently obsolete
Aug 19 13:33:19 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Yes, I remember. I am CCed on the bug. I paged it out since my F23 systems were unaffected.
Aug 19 13:42:19 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Thanks.

Aug 19 21:38:02 <MonkeyofDoom>	which LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE seems to help (webkit2gtk 2.12.3 here, building 2.13.4 presently)
Aug 19 23:48:24 <MonkeyofDoom>	yeah, 2.13.4 is 1fps scrolling on all pages w/o the env var
Aug 21 10:39:08 <Joao>	hey guys, was the create-plugin-widget signal really removed from webkit2gtk?
Aug 21 12:35:28 <Joao>	in that case, how can one embed a gtk widget into a webkitview?
Aug 21 23:43:56 <Joao>	and why don't widgets as object/embed cause the application to fail when the width is set to 100% of the container element?
Aug 21 23:44:45 <Joao>	the error reads something like: " Gdk-ERROR **: The program 'XXXXX' received an X Window System error. / This probably reflects a bug in the program. / The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'. /(Details: serial 1468258 error_code 11 request_code 53 (core protocol) minor_code 0) and more...
Aug 21 23:45:11 <Joao>	sorry, I meant height
Aug 21 23:45:15 <Joao>	width works like a charm
Aug 21 23:45:20 <Joao>	height is the one that screws it all
Aug 21 23:45:51 <Joao>	if I remove "height: 100%", it works, but can't get it to vertically auto-resize to the available space
Aug 21 23:47:04 <Joao>	and stranger even
Aug 21 23:47:10 <Joao>	I can resize the window to grow
Aug 21 23:47:18 <Joao>	but it doesn't allow me to shrink it
Aug 21 23:47:21 <Joao>	(with the mouse, I mean)
Aug 21 23:54:16 <MonkeyofDoom>	create-plugin-widget seems like it would have significant and confusing interaction with multiprocess architecture
Aug 21 23:54:21 <MonkeyofDoom>	as a reason for why it was removed
Aug 22 10:58:59 <garnacho_>	KaL: ping? I think you're a right guy to talk about wayland issues? :)
Aug 22 11:09:42 <KaL>	garnacho_: I'm back
Aug 22 11:11:25 <garnacho_>	KaL: hey :), I'm realizing mcatanzaro might be best, I had a look into the clipboard issues, and just found https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146574
Aug 22 11:11:42 <mcatanzaro>	Hi garnacho_
Aug 22 11:11:47 <KaL>	garnacho_: indeed, I'm only working on accelerated compositing stuff
Aug 22 11:12:28 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: oh! last time I tried to autocomplete you didn't seem to be here :)
Aug 22 11:12:53 <garnacho_>	KaL: nevermind then :)
Aug 22 11:14:15 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: so, reading that last comment, what was your approach to fixing this? I came to think that only proxying clipboard content to the ui process could work...
Aug 22 11:17:02 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: That's exactly what I'm trying. If you're interested in working on it, I haven't gotten very far; I have just a little work done on vacation a month or so ago
Aug 22 11:17:55 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: We already have cross-platform code for proxying clipboard content as it's how it works on macOS and iOS, but we have to reverse the logic in the GTK-specific files to use it
Aug 22 11:20:54 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: right, is it this PasteboardHelper I'm seeing? you already seem to do this to some extent for DnD
Aug 22 11:21:26 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: Yes. Which reminds me, trying to do DnD just causes the web process to crash :)
Aug 22 11:22:37 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: I just left another comment on the bug with a couple hints
Aug 22 11:23:33 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: thanks :). I'm jumping into vacation sometime this week, but nonetheless I think would be great to have this fixed for 3.22, might take time till I get to it, but I eventually will
Aug 22 11:24:12 <mcatanzaro>	yaaaaay :D
Aug 22 17:16:17 <Joao>	so, guys, any idea why I cannot reduce a window which has as only child a webkitgtk control?
Aug 24 04:00:32 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to KaL
Aug 24 04:00:43 *	KaL has changed the topic to: WebKitGTK+ stable: 2.12.4, unstable: 2.13.4 | Homepage: http://webkitgtk.org/ | http://ews-watcher.kov.eti.br/ |  http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTK/2.10.x | http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTK/2.12.x | "HTML is useful for a web content rendering engine.

Aug 24 04:14:03 <blino>	magomez: hi, did you have time to get a look at bug 159928 ? (WebGL GPU-GPU copy)
Aug 24 04:14:37 <magomez>	not yet blino, but I'll try to do it this week
Aug 24 04:21:57 <blino>	great, thanks
Aug 24 16:32:28 <xjuan>	hello guys, is it possible to access a file url from a custom url scheme registered with webkit_web_context_register_uri_scheme() ?
Aug 24 16:32:52 <xjuan>	Received an unexpected URL from the web process: 'file://local.html/'
Aug 24 16:32:54 <xjuan>	Received an invalid message "WebPageProxy.DecidePolicyForNavigationAction" from the web process.
Aug 24 16:33:03 <xjuan>	that the error I get when I try to do so
Aug 24 16:58:27 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: You might have to try different security settings
Aug 24 16:58:53 <mcatanzaro>	There is an AllowUniversalAccessToFileURIs setting; if your app doesn't display any untrusted content, that might be the easiest solution
Aug 24 17:01:03 <xjuan>	ohh nice
Aug 24 17:01:12 <xjuan>	btw this is my test case in JS http://pastebin.com/yh3JNEbV
Aug 24 17:01:26 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: Try https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/unstable/WebKitSecurityManager.html#webkit-security-manager-register-uri-scheme-as-local
Aug 24 17:01:53 <xjuan>	I did, and that is when I get those errors
Aug 24 17:01:54 <mcatanzaro>	Unless you need to use that URI scheme from non-local pages, then it definitely won't work
Aug 24 17:02:12 <mcatanzaro>	Ah, you've already looked into this more than me, sorry. :(
Aug 24 17:02:18 <xjuan>	no the new scheme is local
Aug 24 17:02:47 <xjuan>	nono I am a webkitgtk newby so any help is much appreciated
Aug 24 17:03:20 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: Try flipping https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitSettings.html#WebKitSettings--allow-file-access-from-file-urls as well (though note that's definitely not secure if you allow loading arbitrary file URLs)
Aug 24 17:04:01 <mcatanzaro>	You can also try asking here earlier in the day, when European folks are active; more likely to get a response then. Worst case, it's not possible and requires new API....
Aug 24 17:04:22 <xjuan>	yeah I tried that one too
Aug 24 17:09:36 <xjuan>	mcatanzaro: thanks! I will ask tomorrow morning
Aug 24 19:04:50 <memeka>	Hi, does webkit2gtk uses gstreamer?
Aug 24 19:05:01 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Yes!
Aug 24 19:05:27 <memeka>	The system one or bundled?
Aug 24 19:05:36 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: System!
Aug 24 19:05:57 <memeka>	Decodebin?
Aug 24 19:06:14 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: I don't know!
Aug 24 19:06:37 <memeka>	I get YouTube crashing after the first frame in epiphany 3.20
Aug 24 19:07:21 <memeka>	Default decoder is v4l2 (hw accelerated exynos mfc)
Aug 24 19:07:36 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: That's sad, it works for me on Fedora 24 with WebKitGTK+ 2.12.3 and GStreamer 1.8.3
Aug 24 19:08:03 <mcatanzaro>	If you get a backtrace, then you can file a bug (bugzilla.webkit.org if you think it's a WebKit bug, bugzilla.gnome.org if you think it's a GStreamer bug)
Aug 24 19:08:28 <memeka>	I am assuming it's the decoder not the presentation
Aug 24 19:08:29 <mcatanzaro>	The GStreamer backend code is in Source/WebCore/platform/graphics/gstreamer if you're curious.
Aug 24 19:08:39 <memeka>	Although gst plays correctly
Aug 24 19:09:00 <memeka>	How can I get a trace of gst events?
Aug 24 19:13:21 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: I don't know! I think there is an environment variable. GST_TRACE? GST_DEBUG?
Aug 24 19:13:35 <memeka>	yes i think so, thx!
Aug 24 19:51:21 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: any idea why webGL in wayland is slow?
Aug 24 19:51:39 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: I didn't realize WebGL worked in Wayland!
Aug 24 19:52:21 <memeka>	well, chrome has a chrome://gpu page which shows all gpu details (including EGL extensions)
Aug 24 19:52:37 <memeka>	i could not find anything similar in webkit/epiphany
Aug 24 19:52:50 <mcatanzaro>	I don't think we have anything similar. Sounds like a cool thing to have!
Aug 24 19:53:07 <memeka>	but on a webgl info page, it showed it's compatible with webgl
Aug 24 19:53:16 <memeka>	and showed my GPU string
Aug 24 19:53:21 <memeka>	as opposed to MESA
Aug 24 19:53:28 <mcatanzaro>	I believe you, I just didn't know it was done!
Aug 24 19:53:35 <memeka>	(chrome in xwayland uses llvm mesa)
Aug 24 19:53:47 <memeka>	HOWEVER, webgl stuff is very slow
Aug 24 19:53:52 <memeka>	2-3 fps :)
Aug 24 19:54:08 <memeka>	so maybe it's not done :)
Aug 24 19:54:18 <memeka>	or at least, it's not zero-copy?
Aug 24 19:54:25 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Try running with LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE=1, does that help? If so it's fixed in this morning's release
Aug 24 19:58:42 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23086809/
Aug 24 19:59:08 <memeka>	so i think you were right, webgl is not working :) at least not accelerated :P
Aug 24 19:59:17 <memeka>	Major Performance Caveat:	Not implemented
Aug 24 19:59:19 <memeka>	:)
Aug 24 20:00:02 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder what's not implemented....
Aug 24 20:00:30 <memeka>	it gets the correct vendor, GL version, renderer etc
Aug 24 20:00:44 <memeka>	so it does read libEGL and libGLES
Aug 24 20:00:55 <memeka>	or at least gets them from wayland
Aug 24 20:10:33 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: yay now gstreamer HW decoder is being used
Aug 24 20:10:47 <memeka>	but the video is still not very fluid, i think it's the presentation layer?
Aug 24 20:13:04 <memeka>	either that, or it's scaling done in SW
Aug 25 03:09:25 <keis>	is there some way to get webkit_web_view_run_javascript to return a better error message?
Aug 25 03:10:17 <keis>	it only tells me "An exception was raised in JavaScript" which is not very helpful
Aug 25 03:40:16 <KaL>	keis: yes, we could expose the exception details parameter that we are currently ignoring, please file a bug report
Aug 25 04:02:30 <keis>	KaL: will do
Aug 25 04:02:40 <keis>	are you using the gnome bugzilla?
Aug 25 04:02:50 <KaL>	nope, webkit bugzilla
Aug 25 04:02:53 <keis>	kk
Aug 25 04:03:15 <KaL>	bugs.webkit.org WebKitGtk component
Aug 25 04:09:41 <keis>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161187
Aug 25 04:10:14 <keis>	also found that `window.location` fails like that while `""+window.location` works fine
Aug 25 04:10:22 <keis>	should I open a bug for that too?
Aug 25 04:20:58 <KaL>	sure
Aug 25 09:54:54 <xjuan>	morning guys
Aug 25 09:55:33 <xjuan>	I get the folowing error when I try to open a file:// scheme from a custom scheme like new://
Aug 25 09:55:41 <xjuan>	Received an unexpected URL from the web process: 'file://local.html/'
Aug 25 09:55:43 <xjuan>	Received an invalid message "WebPageProxy.DecidePolicyForNavigationAction" from the web process.
Aug 25 09:56:14 <xjuan>	http://pastebin.com/yh3JNEbV is a simple test case in JS

Aug 25 11:34:56 <KaL>	xjuan: that sounds like mixing different versions of UI and web process
Aug 25 11:35:59 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: No, it sounds like no sandbox extension was taken
Aug 25 11:36:29 <mcatanzaro>	The UI process just refuses to load file URLs from the web process if it hasn't seen them before, unless you change (something)
Aug 25 11:36:30 <KaL>	it's complaining about an invalid message
Aug 25 11:36:57 <KaL>	that could explain the unexpected URL not the invalid message
Aug 25 11:37:11 <mcatanzaro>	Hm
Aug 25 11:39:46 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: I just tried your test case and I'm not seeing those errors, actually
Aug 25 11:40:17 <mcatanzaro>	When I click the middle URL it prints:
Aug 25 11:40:19 <mcatanzaro>	decide-policy: new://local.html

Aug 25 11:40:23 <mcatanzaro>	decide-policy: new://local.html
Aug 25 11:41:50 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: I think the description for our https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/unstable/WebKitSettings.html#WebKitSettings--allow-universal-access-from-file-urls is outdated now, right? You can access local storage regardless of whether the setting is set now in 2.12.4, right?
Aug 25 11:43:04 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: nope, the description is the same
Aug 25 11:43:32 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: ah, well, the local storage part
Aug 25 11:49:02 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: The local storage part!
Aug 25 11:52:59 <KaL>	right, we can probably just omit that part
Aug 25 12:05:29 <xjuan>	mcatanzaro: sorry I was having lunch
Aug 25 12:06:55 <xjuan>	mcatanzaro: you get "CONSOLE ERROR Not allowed to load local resource: file:///home/xjuan/local.html" right?
Aug 25 12:07:06 <mcatanzaro>	No xjuan, I do not
Aug 25 12:07:16 <mcatanzaro>	What version of WebKitGTK+ do you have?
Aug 25 12:08:27 <xjuan>	pkg-config --modversion webkit2gtk-4.0
Aug 25 12:08:30 <xjuan>	2.12.3
Aug 25 12:08:34 <mcatanzaro>	Same as me
Aug 25 12:08:40 <xjuan>	using debian sid here
Aug 25 12:09:27 <xjuan>	btw I get the "Received an unexpected URL" error when I register the new scheme as local

Aug 29 11:47:29 <JeanLuc__>	hi, has anyone tested WebKit.WebView.load_html with a base_uri other than 'null' with the freshly released version 2.14.4?
Aug 29 11:47:56 <JeanLuc__>	sadly the webview is broken for me since the update =/
Aug 29 11:51:17 <KaL>	what does broken mean?
Aug 29 11:52:45 <JeanLuc__>	this is how it looks now: http://imgur.com/gallery/ZDqFs
Aug 29 11:53:17 <JeanLuc__>	and a picture with base_uri = 'null' to compare
Aug 29 11:53:43 <JeanLuc__>	both images and text used to work with base_uri = '/some/path'
Aug 29 11:54:57 <KaL>	I guess fonts are blocked by csp or something like that
Aug 29 11:55:24 <KaL>	or cross-origin checks
Aug 29 11:56:22 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: if you file a bug report with a simple test case in C to try, I can try to bisect to find the commit
Aug 29 11:56:24 <JeanLuc__>	csp? is there a workaround? is there anything I can do in my code (other than not using base_uri, which is kind of a deal-breaker for me)?
Aug 29 11:56:44 <JeanLuc__>	never written anything gobject in c =/
Aug 29 11:57:42 <JeanLuc__>	does generated c-code from vala work for you in this case?
Aug 29 12:01:23 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: as long as it builds it's fine
Aug 29 12:01:50 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: if there's a regression, I'll fix it and make a new release
Aug 29 12:12:30 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: could you open the inspector and check if there's any error in the js console?
Aug 29 12:29:47 <JeanLuc__>	KaL: how do i open the inspector?
Aug 29 12:29:57 <JeanLuc__>	KaL: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161313
Aug 29 12:30:26 <KaL>	right click, open inspector, you need to enable developer extras setting first
Aug 29 12:32:42 <JeanLuc__>	opened the insector, further instructions? :D
Aug 29 12:43:39 <KaL>	check the console
Aug 29 12:53:28 <JeanLuc__>	KaL: only a blue box with "Selected Element" and then the html-element that I selected below
Aug 29 12:53:42 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: in you exampole you are using literally file://some/path/
Aug 29 12:54:03 <KaL>	fonts in the article are using relative paths
Aug 29 12:54:17 <KaL>	and of course  file://some/path/assets/whateverfont
Aug 29 12:54:21 <KaL>	doesn't exists
Aug 29 12:58:11 <JeanLuc__>	KaL, totally forgot about the fonts (a webdesigner wrote the css for me), I will fix the css and close the bugs. Any idea why it worked before when it actually shuldn't? oO
Aug 29 12:59:50 <KaL>	no idea, I guess a security fix made the thing more strict
Aug 29 13:00:27 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: but, where are those fonts supposed to be located?
Aug 29 13:00:48 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: when using null those are ignored, I think, and fallbacks are probably used
Aug 29 13:00:55 <KaL>	that's why itworks
Aug 29 13:01:22 <JeanLuc__>	OOOkay :D, well big thank you for your time. I will fix it and close the bugs as soon as I'm done.
Aug 29 13:01:50 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: the thing is that if those are supposed to be local, then you should indeed use a base uri
Aug 29 13:01:59 <JeanLuc__>	no that's no what I meant, before 2.12.4 it used to work even with random base_uri paths
Aug 29 13:02:36 <KaL>	using random base_uri paths doesn't make any sense
Aug 29 13:02:54 <KaL>	if you don't load any local resource then simply use null
Aug 29 13:03:05 <JeanLuc__>	well, the path to where the images were stored, but not the fonts
Aug 29 13:03:08 <KaL>	and about:blank is automatically used as the base uri
Aug 29 13:03:18 <KaL>	ah
Aug 29 13:03:23 <KaL>	ok
Aug 29 13:05:06 <JeanLuc__>	Is there a way to have to locations from where resources can be loaded? The fonts are installed with the package (so most likely /usr/share/) but the images of the articles are downloaded into $HOME/.local/share/ of the user
Aug 29 13:05:22 <JeanLuc__>	... to have TWO locations ...
Aug 29 18:54:00 <brrian>	Hi folks. I am adding a derived sources phase to WebInspectorUI.
Aug 29 18:54:24 <brrian>	I think I can figure out the CMake needed, but just a heads up.
Aug 29 18:55:05 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: What could possibly go wrong! (sarcasm)
Aug 29 18:55:21 <mcatanzaro>	Good luck; if you can't make it work, we'll try to fix it tomorrow
Aug 29 18:55:35 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: I even have a VM :)
Aug 29 18:56:44 <brrian>	planning to move more of our messy perl script into actual build files now that Windows VS project is irrelevant
Aug 29 18:59:41 *	mcatanzaro can barely ready our Perl scripts
Aug 30 00:13:40 <memeka>	hi; what are the sinks used for video in wayland?
Aug 30 00:48:43 <memeka>	anyone?
Aug 30 02:41:45 <philn>	memeka: there's an internal video sink
Aug 30 02:42:08 <memeka>	philn: and that one is not EGL is it :(
Aug 30 02:42:11 <philn>	doesn't depend on the windowing protocol
Aug 30 02:42:22 <memeka>	it's very slow on wayland
Aug 30 02:42:40 <philn>	yep
Aug 30 02:42:41 <memeka>	is there a way to use the opengl sink (from gst-plugins-bad) ?
Aug 30 02:42:47 <philn>	yep
Aug 30 02:42:51 <memeka>	how? :D
Aug 30 02:43:31 <philn>	you would need to rebuild webkitgtk, setting the USE_GSTREAMER_GL option to ON
Aug 30 02:43:51 <philn>	it's disabled by default for now
Aug 30 02:46:19 <memeka>	philn: any plans to turn it on soon?
Aug 30 02:46:46 <philn>	it's declared in Source/cmake/OptionsGTK.cmake but i forgot how enable it without editing that file :)
Aug 30 02:47:23 <philn>	there's no date set in stone for the switch
Aug 30 02:49:11 <memeka>	philn: thx
Aug 30 02:49:17 <memeka>	i'll try to recompile
Aug 30 02:52:35 <memeka>	philn: it's gonna use the opengl sink from the system's gst, right? if it works with gst-launch-1.0 it should work in epiphany too ...
Aug 30 02:53:18 <philn>	memeka: not exactly, if you're building trunk we use an appsink there for GL video rendering
Aug 30 02:53:19 <memeka>	there;s also a gtksink, it's not gonna use that one, issit?
Aug 30 02:53:33 <philn>	but it's similar in behavior to glimagesink
Aug 30 02:53:47 <memeka>	not on my system :-S
Aug 30 02:54:16 <philn>	i mean the GL appsink is enabled if USE_GSTREAMER_GL is on
Aug 30 02:54:27 <memeka>	yes of course
Aug 30 02:54:30 <memeka>	just wanted to make sure
Aug 30 02:54:37 <memeka>	what sink exactly is gonna be used
Aug 30 02:54:43 <memeka>	gtksink, or glimagesink
Aug 30 02:54:53 <philn>	neither :)
Aug 30 02:55:02 <memeka>	(what's USE_GSTREAMER_MPEGTS?)
Aug 30 02:55:24 <memeka>	philn: where's the code then for this neither sink? :)
Aug 30 02:55:51 <philn>	the MPEGTS option is used for <track> element support iirc
Aug 30 02:56:04 <memeka>	platform/graphics/gstreamer/MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer.cpp ?
Aug 30 02:56:17 <philn>	MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase.cpp
Aug 30 02:56:32 <philn>	look for GSTREAMER_GL there
Aug 30 02:57:56 <memeka>	k, i see EGL and Wayland there :D
Aug 30 02:58:41 <memeka>	do i need to make sure COORDINATED_GRAPHICS_THREADED it's also ON?
Aug 30 02:59:35 <memeka>	looks like it's on based on ENABLE_OPENGL
Aug 30 03:00:28 <philn>	humm yes it might be needed
Aug 30 03:00:40 <memeka>	i saw it depends on ENABLE_OPENGL
Aug 30 03:00:48 <philn>	but i'm not sure the threaded compositor works under Wayland
Aug 30 03:00:53 <memeka>	and ENABLE_OPENGL depends on USE_GSTREAMER_GL
Aug 30 03:01:03 <memeka>	hm
Aug 30 03:01:17 <philn>	that's ok memeka, ENABLE_OPENGL is the general option for GL which includes EGL
Aug 30 03:01:47 <philn>	yoon: what's the status of threaded compositor in Wayland?
Aug 30 03:02:20 <philn>	perhaps KaL knows too :)
Aug 30 03:02:49 <memeka>	i'll wait until i start compiling then :) takes 7-8 hours on my system
Aug 30 03:06:40 <KaL>	philn: threaded compositor is now the default in both X11 and wayland
Aug 30 03:06:53 <memeka>	yay
Aug 30 03:07:05 <philn>	memeka: see you in 8 hours
Aug 30 03:07:09 <philn>	:)
Aug 30 03:07:26 <memeka>	KaL: is it good in webkit2gtk-2.12.3 ?
Aug 30 03:07:42 <memeka>	that's the one i has currently
Aug 30 03:07:50 <KaL>	no, it's current trunk that will be 2.14 in couple of months
Aug 30 03:08:05 <philn>	i'm not sure 2.12.3 has the latest appsink GL changes
Aug 30 03:08:11 <KaL>	or even earlier I don't remember the schedule :-P
Aug 30 03:08:20 <KaL>	no, I didn't merge those
Aug 30 03:08:47 <philn>	memeka: if you could try a trunk snapshot it would be better then
Aug 30 03:08:54 <memeka>	of course
Aug 30 03:09:23 <KaL>	current trunk doesn't build, give me some minutes to fix it
Aug 30 03:11:56 <memeka>	waiting to  svn checkout https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk WebKit2 :)
Aug 30 03:11:58 <foser>	KaL: schedule is in weeks i think? if it follows gnome release.. not sure if the new epiphany hard deps on 2.13
Aug 30 03:12:26 <memeka>	well, i will be using the ubuntu receipe to build it
Aug 30 03:12:33 <KaL>	foser: right, weeks :-)
Aug 30 03:12:43 <memeka>	so it will be seen as 2.12.3 :)
Aug 30 03:18:11 <memeka>	KaL: let me know when i can checkout
Aug 30 03:36:55 <KaL>	memeka: build is now fixed
Aug 30 03:38:36 <memeka>	KaL: thx, checking out now
Aug 30 03:38:54 <memeka>	i'll be back in many hours, compiling on ARM is not that fast :P
Aug 30 03:39:37 <philn>	memeka: you should cross-compile :)
Aug 30 03:39:44 <memeka>	naah
Aug 30 03:40:06 <memeka>	8 cores is reasonably fast
Aug 30 03:40:30 <memeka>	actually let's call them 4
Aug 30 03:40:48 <memeka>	cause 4 are stupid, and do more harm in using up the RAM
Aug 30 03:40:52 <memeka>	:)

Aug 30 13:04:58 <brrian>	how to clean just derived sources for one project?
Aug 30 13:40:12 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: For one subdirectory? You can try deleting just that directory manually; I think it should work
Aug 30 13:40:23 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: ok
Aug 30 13:40:33 <mcatanzaro>	e.g. WebKitBuild/Debug/
Aug 30 13:40:48 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: I'm making a separate CMakeLists.txt for WebInspectorUI, which at a minimum has the new derived sources generation command and a shared list of resources
Aug 30 13:40:59 <mcatanzaro>	Sorry, delete WebKitBuild/Debug/WebInspectorUI and I *think* they should be regenerated properly, rebuilding only the minimum number of things required
Aug 30 13:41:04 <brrian>	every CMake port seems to do something different with the files, so that stuff will be in the .cmake files
Aug 30 13:41:17 <brrian>	k
Aug 30 13:41:33 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: #webkit would probably be a better place to discuss this since all CMake folks will be there (e.g. alexchristensen)
Aug 30 13:41:40 <brrian>	yeah he's aware
Aug 30 13:41:50 <brrian>	apparently EFL runs its own minifier o_O
Aug 30 13:41:53 <brrian>	that could backfire
Aug 30 13:42:09 <mcatanzaro>	Just for the web inspector...?
Aug 30 13:42:12 <brrian>	well
Aug 30 13:42:15 <brrian>	UglifyJS
Aug 30 13:42:28 <brrian>	for Make based ports we run a perl script that minifies and combines stuff
Aug 30 13:42:41 <mcatanzaro>	Is minification really useful for the web inspector?
Aug 30 13:42:53 <brrian>	concatenation is way more important
Aug 30 13:43:07 <brrian>	otherwise WebCore has to spin through ~400 resource loads before showing anything
Aug 30 13:43:31 <brrian>	but minifying helps reduce parse times a little bit. on Mac we use a very simple minifier, no renaming or anything.
Aug 30 13:44:17 <brrian>	I don't know what the GResource stuff does, but if you want to improve load times it should be pretty easy to copy or reuse the perl script
Aug 30 13:47:35 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: It puts all the data inside the binary itself, in some fancy ELF location
Aug 30 13:47:43 <brrian>	ah I see
Aug 30 13:47:45 <mcatanzaro>	So there is no file opening
Aug 30 13:47:58 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: If you're curious: https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2012/01/26/resources-in-glib/
Aug 30 13:48:01 <brrian>	sure, but it still has to go through the network loader
Aug 30 13:48:26 <annulen>	brrian: are you talking about WebInspectorUI/Scripts/copy-user-interface-resources.pl? There is yet another script doing similar thing, JavaScriptCore/Scripts/inline-and-minify-stylesheets-and-scripts.py
Aug 30 13:48:37 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: nice link!
Aug 30 13:48:47 <brrian>	annulen: yeah, I'm starting to break that script up a bit
Aug 30 13:48:52 <annulen>	cool
Aug 30 13:48:59 <annulen>	I was tempted to use it in Qt
Aug 30 13:49:09 <brrian>	annulen: only Mac uses it afaik
Aug 30 13:49:17 <brrian>	I'm consolidating some CMake stuff
Aug 30 13:49:41 <annulen>	I know, and anyone trying to refactor it on pther platform will necessary break Mac things :)
Aug 30 13:50:31 <brrian>	heh
Aug 30 13:50:47 <brrian>	well most of what it does is easy enough to do in CMake or Make
Aug 30 13:51:00 <brrian>	and way easier to maintain
Aug 30 13:51:02 <brrian>	that way
Aug 30 13:53:10 <brrian>	annulen: pretty much all of the minification/combining should be independent of the port-specific resource packaging system.. the input is either a few combined files or a few hundred files from source
Aug 30 13:53:57 <annulen>	fully agree, if it doesn't require installing nodejs, like EFL approach :)
Aug 30 13:54:05 <brrian>	yeah, that's a nonstarter for us
Aug 30 13:54:13 <brrian>	and our minifier is much simpler little python script
Aug 30 13:54:42 <brrian>	btw, is there some rhyme or reason to using ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/Source/WebInspectorUI/... vs ${WEBINSPECTORUI_DIR}/...
Aug 30 13:55:02 <brrian>	the latter seems better, except SOURCES lists don't use prefixes usually
Aug 30 13:55:25 <mcatanzaro>	Probably no rhyme or reason, should probably standardize on WEBINSPECTORUI_DIR
Aug 30 13:55:30 <brrian>	k
Aug 30 13:56:31 <brrian>	another interesting difference is that on Mac, DerivedSources is usually flattened, whereas with CMake it seems to parallel the source layout
Aug 30 13:57:59 <brrian>	ugh.. is there some magic to make ubuntu have emacs line-oriented keybindings everywhere/ :P
Aug 30 13:58:42 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: There is a GTK+ setting for that actually... somewhere...
Aug 30 13:58:51 <brrian>	looks like
Aug 30 13:58:56 <brrian>	gnome-tweak-tools or something
Aug 30 13:59:00 <annulen>	one possible problem with minification: you have to inline everything into both Main.html and Test,html
Aug 30 13:59:21 <annulen>	so it becomes important to get rid of Test.html in production build
Aug 30 13:59:22 <brrian>	annulen: that's not what is done now
Aug 30 13:59:57 <brrian>	Main.html is normal and includes Main.js (which has 100's of files) and all the redundant includes are removed
Aug 30 14:00:04 <brrian>	the same for Test.html
Aug 30 14:00:19 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: in gnome-tweak-tool: Keyboard and Mouse -> Key theme -> Emacs
Aug 30 14:00:36 <mcatanzaro>	That's in GNOME 3.20, Ubuntu will have something older, but *probably* will be in the same place
Aug 30 14:00:52 <mcatanzaro>	(It will only work for GTK+ apps of course)
Aug 30 14:01:03 <brrian>	yeah
Aug 30 14:01:28 <brrian>	emacs bindings everywhere is one thing that OS X has done since NextStep probably, which I take for granted
Aug 30 14:01:38 <brrian>	I have fixed a few kill ring bugs in WebKit ;-)
Aug 30 14:01:39 <mcatanzaro>	Impressive
Aug 30 14:02:22 <mcatanzaro>	Yeah I remember someone (you?) talking about kill ring at the Contributors Meeting last year... I was more than a bit surprised to learn WebKit supports that
Aug 30 14:02:41 <mcatanzaro>	Anyway brrian some "good" news: emacs depends on WebKitGTK+ now
Aug 30 14:02:49 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: kill ring C-k C-y etc works in any Cocoa app
Aug 30 14:03:02 <mcatanzaro>	I do not know why, but the rumor I heard was so it could play videos
Aug 30 14:03:09 <brrian>	o_O
Aug 30 14:03:30 <brrian>	maybe it's necessary for EmacsOS
Aug 30 14:03:35 <brrian>	=P
Aug 30 14:03:59 <mcatanzaro>	They are using WebKit1 (very old/insecure WebKitGTK+ 2.4) though, so now I have the enviable task of proposing we remove Emacs from Fedora (won't happen, WK is an optional dependency) to get rid of WebKit1
Aug 30 14:05:11 <mcatanzaro>	Oh wow, looks like they switched to git, at long last....
Aug 30 14:05:13 <mcatanzaro>	http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git
Aug 30 14:05:59 <mcatanzaro>	http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/configure.ac#n2625 "Enable xwidgets if GTK3 and WebKitGTK+ are available."
Aug 30 14:06:17 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder what xwidgets are. And if I was gullible for believing videos. ;)
Aug 30 14:07:00 <brrian>	I tried to dual boot ubuntu on my fast new PC but the installer kernel panicked :(
Aug 30 14:07:06 <brrian>	so I'm doing this stuff back in my VM
Aug 30 14:07:19 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: Fedora!
Aug 30 14:07:31 <brrian>	yeah, I guess. :|
Aug 30 14:07:37 <brrian>	I have no allegiance
Aug 30 14:07:45 <mcatanzaro>	Fedora!
Aug 30 14:07:48 <brrian>	I do have fancy new hardware
Aug 30 14:08:11 <brrian>	well not that new, it's a Z170 chipset and a skylake i7
Aug 30 14:08:18 <mcatanzaro>	Ubuntu!
Aug 30 14:08:40 <mcatanzaro>	But seriously, Intel released a bad microcode update and it's apparently breaking Skylake laptops
Aug 30 14:09:00 <mcatanzaro>	You're safe on Ubuntu because Ubuntu doesn't update anything
Aug 30 14:09:00 <brrian>	I mean, how long does it take for Debian or Fedora or anyone to add a major Intel rev :) :P
Aug 30 14:09:17 <brrian>	not if the installer is borked
Aug 30 14:09:27 <mcatanzaro>	Oh yeah, you did just mention that
Aug 30 14:10:01 <brrian>	ok, sweet. the keybindings work
Aug 30 14:10:13 <brrian>	well, at least in GTK apps (not sublime)
Aug 30 14:13:03 <brrian>	heh. good ole CMake.
Aug 30 14:13:20 <brrian>	if I spent more time with it, it would be easier right? :P
Aug 30 14:13:34 <brrian>	Make is atrocious so I can't love it no matter how many hours
Aug 30 14:14:56 <annulen>	make is way more straightforward, flexible, never gets in your way
Aug 30 14:15:39 <brrian>	I agree with 1 and 2
Aug 30 14:15:41 <brrian>	not 3
Aug 30 14:15:49 <mcatanzaro>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/empathy/commit/?id=03ad9867f02aeb337d61b0b26ba687593bede9f0
Aug 30 14:15:55 <brrian>	or I guess, there are so many gotchas
Aug 30 14:16:22 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Have you been following meson?
Aug 30 14:16:44 <annulen>	not really
Aug 30 14:17:04 <mcatanzaro>	They're trying to be the next autotools/cmake replacement; got some traction with GStreamer and they're aiming for GNOME next
Aug 30 14:17:16 *	mcatanzaro intends to investigate it more seriously eventually
Aug 30 14:17:47 <annulen>	I was involved in premake some time ago
Aug 30 14:21:34 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: is there some concept of Engineering vs Production builds for webkitgtk?
Aug 30 14:21:52 <brrian>	there are some things we only usually include in builds from source, like the uncaught exception reporter
Aug 30 14:22:15 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: Yes, -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release vs. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
Aug 30 14:22:25 <mcatanzaro>	Also: -DDEVELOPER_MODE=ON
Aug 30 14:23:09 <brrian>	hmm, how would I convert that to ENGINEERING_BUILD? true if Debug or DEVELOPER_MODE=ON?
Aug 30 14:23:38 <brrian>	the combined Inspector.html.in uses ENGINEERING_BUILD macro just because that's what I know
Aug 30 14:23:42 <mcatanzaro>	Probably just if (DEVELOPER_MODE)
Aug 30 14:24:30 <mcatanzaro>	Debug vs. Release is more just about whether to compile debug info, or enable assertions, leak tracking of WebCore objects....
Aug 30 14:24:37 <brrian>	right
Aug 30 14:24:46 <brrian>	Mac port has a separate level above that
Aug 30 14:25:21 <mcatanzaro>	I forget what we use DEVELOPER_MODE for, probably for loading stuff from the current directory; that's probably what you want to use
Aug 30 14:25:33 <brrian>	ok!
Aug 30 14:34:31 <brrian>	annulen: do you know where the top-level ENABLE_WEBCORE, etc gets set?
Aug 30 14:34:50 <brrian>	I can't find it anywhere! don't know if ENABLE_WEBINSPECTORUI is necessary or just use ENABLE_WEBKIT2
Aug 30 14:35:46 <annulen>	brrian: OptionsXXX.cmake
Aug 30 14:36:00 <annulen>	but there is no ENABLE_WEBCORE afaik
Aug 30 14:36:15 <annulen>	oops, there is
Aug 30 14:38:21 <brrian>	so my new CMakeLists.txt isn't getting picked up.
Aug 30 14:38:31 <brrian>	but I added add_subdirectory to the top-level file
Aug 30 14:38:45 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: Strange, you might need to re-run cmake...?
Aug 30 14:39:00 <brrian>	well, I see it running again
Aug 30 14:39:06 <brrian>	maybe it's using some cached things
Aug 30 14:39:42 <annulen>	brrian: are you adding add_subdirectory to Source/CMakeLists.txt?
Aug 30 14:39:53 <brrian>	ya
Aug 30 15:08:25 <brrian>	annulen: now the file is picked up, but its definitions aren't accessible from OptionsGTK.cmake
Aug 30 15:08:30 <brrian>	o_O
Aug 30 15:10:23 <annulen>	brrian: it goes in reverse, OptionsGTK.cmake is visible everywhere
Aug 30 15:10:45 <brrian>	er, my bad
Aug 30 15:10:52 <brrian>	PlatformGTK.cmake in WebKit2
Aug 30 15:11:14 <annulen>	oh, they are separate from each other
Aug 30 15:11:22 <brrian>	can't see CMakeLists.txt in WebInspectorUI
Aug 30 15:12:49 <brrian>	I had kinda assumed all variables were global, maybe not
Aug 30 15:12:58 <annulen>	no, they aren't
Aug 30 15:13:20 <brrian>	I can move that particular rule to PlatformGTK.cmake in WebInspectorUI, then use the generated XML file from derived sources in WebKit2's PlatformGTK.cmake
Aug 30 15:13:33 <brrian>	now to figure out how the platform files get included.. :P
Aug 30 15:14:38 <annulen>	some time ago I tried to do similar thing in my fork for Qt port, but I gave up and ended up including WebInspectorUI/PlatformQt.cmake where resource are needed
Aug 30 15:16:10 <annulen>	https://github.com/annulen/webkit/commit/4dfce6e929322a61975b509663b55b46c445f10c
Aug 30 15:17:11 <brrian>	do the platform.cmake files just get automatically picked up?
Aug 30 15:17:15 <brrian>	can't see any refs
Aug 30 15:17:29 <annulen>	WEBKIT_INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILES_IF_EXISTS() pick them
Aug 30 15:17:46 <annulen>	if there is no WEBKIT_INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILES_IF_EXISTS in that dir, it's not picked :)
Aug 30 15:17:46 <brrian>	ahhhh
Aug 30 15:17:47 <brrian>	magics
Aug 30 15:17:48 <brrian>	ok
Aug 30 15:17:55 <brrian>	I wonder what that did
Aug 30 15:18:06 <brrian>	you folks are so helpful
Aug 30 15:18:34 <mcatanzaro>	My super key stopped working after I did something in gnome-initial-setup, I should be less helpful :(
Aug 30 15:18:45 <mcatanzaro>	Sorry, I meant gnome-tweak-tool
Aug 30 15:18:51 <mcatanzaro>	What did I change, I don't remember changing anything :(
Aug 30 15:22:09 <annulen>	brrian: btw, I use yet another script to bundle inspector files into resource file, qt resources are very similar but yet not 100% equivalent to glib resources, you can see its invocation in patch above
Aug 30 15:22:19 <brrian>	yeah I saw
Aug 30 15:22:41 <brrian>	so I have WebInspectorUI_RESOURCES
Aug 30 15:23:07 <brrian>	which include js, html, css. eventually that list would include combined files if needed
Aug 30 15:23:21 <brrian>	and the port-specific packager shouldn't care
Aug 30 15:23:35 <brrian>	it can filter out for JS or CSS or whatever if needs to do something special
Aug 30 15:24:01 <brrian>	as long as it searches WEBINSPECTORUI_DERIVED_SOURCES since that's where the combined files would go
Aug 30 15:25:12 <annulen>	I think we need shared list of inspector files + some switch what icon directory should be used
Aug 30 15:25:37 <annulen>	maintaining separate lists leads to omissions which go unnoticed
Aug 30 15:25:46 <brrian>	annulen: yeah, especially as I make things complicated
Aug 30 15:25:52 <brrian>	but can't each platform file append to the main list?
Aug 30 15:26:01 <annulen>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156165
Aug 30 15:26:12 <annulen>	yes
Aug 30 15:26:39 <brrian>	I need to find whoever does EFL and get them to use the shared list
Aug 30 15:26:42 <brrian>	it does something funky now
Aug 30 15:26:52 <annulen>	they grab everything
Aug 30 15:26:55 <annulen>	literally
Aug 30 15:27:29 <annulen>	look in Source/PlatformEFL.cmake
Aug 30 15:27:32 <brrian>	randomly minifying files with ES6 is probably not a good idea
Aug 30 15:27:35 <brrian>	yea I have it open
Aug 30 15:37:41 <brrian>	 Cannot find source file: /home/bburg/repos/webkit/OpenSource/WebKitBuild/Release/DerivedSources/WebInspectorUI/InspectorGResourceBundle.c
Aug 30 15:37:56 <brrian>	I appended it to WebKit2_DERIVED_SOURCES
Aug 30 15:38:19 <brrian>	the rule to create it is in WebInspectorUI/PlatformGTK.cmake, not sure why it can't see the reipe
Aug 30 15:38:21 <brrian>	recipe
Aug 30 15:41:27 <annulen>	brrian: you may need GENERATED property on that file
Aug 30 15:41:43 <annulen>	cmake is very dumb sometimes
Aug 30 15:43:31 <brrian>	didn't help.
Aug 30 15:44:43 <brrian>	maybe I need to add it to some dummy target in WebInspectorUI
Aug 30 15:45:43 <annulen>	be careful not to make it rebuilding on each run
Aug 30 15:46:35 <brrian>	something we have done in Make before is output a file with the contents of a list
Aug 30 15:46:50 <brrian>	to force it to invalidate when the list changes
Aug 30 15:47:47 <brrian>	add_custom_target(stageSharedScripts DEPENDS ${JavaScriptCore_SCRIPTS})
Aug 30 15:47:47 <brrian>	add_dependencies(JavaScriptCore stageSharedScripts)
Aug 30 15:47:52 <brrian>	that looks similar
