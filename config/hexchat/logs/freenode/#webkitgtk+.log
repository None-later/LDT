Jul 27 07:21:45 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos, you probably want this for Ephy - https://paste.fedoraproject.org/396245/46961841/ (I'm waiting on WK compilation to actually compile this patch)..
Jul 27 07:52:52 <KaL>	tpopela: file a bug report and attach the patch, please
Jul 27 07:57:51 <tpopela>	KaL, ok, will do! btw Is rego on PTO? I'm having some difficulties regarding to accommodation for hackfest (no response from Avenida on my mail)..
Jul 27 08:00:21 <KaL>	PTO?
Jul 27 08:04:15 <tpopela>	KaL, Paid Time Off - holidays..
Jul 27 08:04:35 <KaL>	ah, I don't know, let me check
Jul 27 08:16:55 <KaL>	tpopela: yes, it seems he is going to be off for a few days
Jul 27 08:17:09 <KaL>	tpopela: maybe calvaris can help you
Jul 27 08:17:40 <tpopela>	KaL, ok and thank you! :)
Jul 27 09:21:41 <calvaris>	tpopela: I think we'll handle the reservations later
Jul 27 09:21:57 <calvaris>	is there any reasons you are in a hurry?
Jul 27 09:22:54 <tpopela>	calvaris, Hi! :) nope, I just wanted to remove it from my TODO :).. Anyway lajava talked with them and they did not receive my mail..
Jul 27 09:23:35 <tpopela>	calvaris, also you know this year I'm really looking forward to your famous octopus ;)
Jul 27 09:23:48 <calvaris>	tpopela: dude, I became vegan
Jul 27 09:23:52 <calvaris>	:D
Jul 27 09:23:57 <calvaris>	not eating it anymore
Jul 27 09:23:59 <mcatanzaro>	Plot twist!
Jul 27 09:24:01 <tpopela>	calvaris, no way :D
Jul 27 09:24:07 <calvaris>	yes way
Jul 27 09:24:39 <calvaris>	but I guess somebody else will do it instead of me
Jul 27 09:26:39 <tpopela>	calvaris, wow.. ok, then you need to prepare something vegan ;)
Jul 27 09:27:49 <calvaris>	there will be vegan options as usual
Jul 27 09:29:22 <aperezdc>	pretty much anyone from Galicia can make some octopus, or when around the region know some place where to go eat it
Jul 27 09:30:01 <aperezdc>	:)
Jul 27 09:30:02 <mcatanzaro>	"yoon: pulpo!"
Jul 27 09:31:05 <tpopela>	aperezdc, I think that you are definitely right.. I was just trying to "pay my debts" as last time I went with joanie and others to the indian place.. ;)
Jul 27 09:31:09 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, :D:D
Jul 27 09:31:19 <aperezdc>	:-)
Jul 27 09:32:27 <calvaris>	tpopela: cool, I'll go to the indian this time
Jul 27 09:36:11 <tpopela>	btw guys do you know if there is any "tourists | pedestrians | good for running/walking" path from La Coruna do Santiago de Compostela?
Jul 27 09:44:54 <aperezdc>	tpopela: there's the “Camino Inglés” → https://www.followthecamino.com/camino_tours/camino-ingles
Jul 27 09:45:18 <aperezdc>	allegedly, it's the branch of the pilgrimage walkpath to Santiago followed by the people who arrived from the North by sea
Jul 27 09:45:37 <aperezdc>	Coruña→Santiago is “only” ~75 km
Jul 27 09:47:13 <aperezdc>	tpopela: you can also make it a bit shorter by picking a bus to Betanzos (which is a nice town to visit) and starting the walk from there
Jul 27 09:48:25 <tpopela>	aperezdc, thank you! I plan to run and 75 km is fine :)..
Jul 27 09:49:40 <aperezdc>	tpopela: you're welcome! there's probably other routes, but the good thing of following the pilgrim's route is that most (if not all) of the paths should be signalled, and also it passes through historical places which one can visit, and there's usually lodging along the route if needed/wanted
Jul 27 09:52:42 <calvaris>	tpopela: wow, running
Jul 27 09:53:20 <tpopela>	aperezdc, yes that will be super handy if it will be signaled (I hate to look to the phone/map too often ;))
Jul 27 09:57:27 <aperezdc>	tpopela: just follow the shell signs → https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=camino+de+santiago+señal ;-)
Jul 27 09:58:05 <tpopela>	aperezdc, so I'm trying to find the exact map, but I manage to found just one from Ferrol (referenced from https://www.followthecamino.com/trip/camino-ingles )
Jul 27 09:58:22 <tpopela>	aperezdc, nice :)
Jul 27 09:59:43 <aperezdc>	tpopela: this is a blog+podcast of some person who made it from Coruña → http://indietravelpodcast.com/spain/walking-camino-ingles/
Jul 27 10:00:22 *	aperezdc digs a bit more
Jul 27 10:01:06 <tpopela>	aperezdc, wow this looks superb..
Jul 27 10:04:59 <aperezdc>	tpopela: i've found this as well → https://www.caminodesantiago.me/wp-content/uploads/Camino-Ingles-with-maps-22-August-2012.pdf
Jul 27 10:06:19 <aperezdc>	searching in Spanish I've found GPX tracks here: http://www.rayyrosa.com/caminoingles/mapa-y-track
Jul 27 10:06:53 <aperezdc>	tpopela: direct link to the Coruña→Santiago GPX here → http://www.rayyrosa.com/wp-content/uploads/gpx/INGLES-variante-a-coruna.gpx
Jul 27 10:08:59 <aperezdc>	tpopela: probably there's a lot more of stuff in the official website made by the regional government → http://www.caminodesantiago.gal/en/inicio
Jul 27 10:09:18 <tpopela>	aperezdc, wow thank you again! this will be really helpful!
Jul 27 10:09:25 <aperezdc>	...and I'll leave it here, betcha that's enough to get you started :D

Jul 30 17:19:39 <hux>	getting an error while trying to build gnome app using jhbuild
Jul 30 17:19:41 <hux>	http://pastebin.com/9Z7KshjG
Jul 30 17:21:43 <mcatanzaro>	hux: Any chance that harfbuzz was built with a different C++ ABI than WebKit? What distro is this?
Jul 30 17:22:14 <hux>	ubuntu 16.04
Jul 30 17:23:39 <mcatanzaro>	You built harfbuzz with jhbuild? What version of GCC?
Jul 30 17:24:00 <mcatanzaro>	Wait why am I asking about harfbuzz, it's not anywhere in your paste
Jul 30 17:24:24 <mcatanzaro>	Seriously no clue why I thought of it, hm
Jul 30 17:24:51 <hux>	i am trying to build gnome-calendar
Jul 30 17:24:56 <hux>	gcc version 5.4.0 20160609
Jul 30 17:25:38 <mcatanzaro>	hux, any chance you upgraded from an older Ubuntu, and had used jhbuild previously? If so you've probably got a mix of C++ ABIs in your jhbuild environment. If not, I have no clue. :(
Jul 30 17:26:01 <mcatanzaro>	/home/huzaifa/jhbuild/install/lib/libpangoft2-1.0.so.0: undefined reference to `FcWeightToOpenType' <-- hm, that one is different, no C++ there
Jul 30 17:27:53 <hux>	i had a failed attempt at building another gnome-app using jhbuild recently
Jul 30 17:28:36 <mcatanzaro>	hux: Is it possible that jhbuild built fontconfig but not pango? It looks you might have multiple problems here, this is strange. :(
Jul 30 17:31:33 <hux>	should i ignore this error and continue to install?
Jul 30 17:31:46 <mcatanzaro>	hux: Nope, this is pretty fatal
Jul 30 17:32:09 <mcatanzaro>	You can add skip = ['WebKit'] to your jhbuildrc and try again; I'm pretty sure gnome-calendar does not need super recent WebKit
Jul 30 17:32:31 <mcatanzaro>	But I wonder if something else is going to fail... it might be worth deleting your jhbuild install directory and starting fresh
Jul 30 17:35:25 <hux>	mcatanzaro: ok starting afresh. Thanx
Aug 03 03:39:25 <mcrha>	hi KaL et al, maybe known, I do not know, but I'm at commit 0e55b186a of a WebKit git master checkout (git-svn-id: http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk@204076) and I cannot build it, it errors at: make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/xxd.pl', needed by 'DerivedSources/WebCore/InspectorOverlayPage.h'.  Stop.
Aug 03 03:39:56 <mcrha>	any advice?
Aug 03 03:40:45 <KaL>	hmm, I haven't updated today yet, and bots are building fine, so maybe it's a clean build issue
Aug 03 03:41:46 <KaL>	mcrha: I'll update and try a clean build
Aug 03 03:42:50 <mcrha>	KaL, I had some "very" old checkout (more than a month), that failed, thus I `git clean -xfd`, reconfigured, and still got this error
Aug 03 03:45:35 <mcrha>	KaL, I see the missing xxd.pl file at /Source/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/..., thus maybe only the path is wrong, or the configuration of it failed somehow
Aug 03 05:13:41 <tpopela>	mcrha, KaL clean build succeeded here..
Aug 03 05:25:37 <mcrha>	tpopela, what is 'clean build'? the `git clean -xfd` erases everything unknown in the git checkout, then I created a build/ subfolder, entered it and called `cmake ...`, then `make`. The build cannot be cleaner, I'm afraid.
Aug 03 05:27:04 <tpopela>	mcrha, clean build means cloning a git WebKit repo on a different machine, running Tools/Scripts/webkitgtk-update-libs and then running build-webkit --gtk --release
Aug 03 05:27:25 <tpopela>	mcrha, did you rm -rf WebKitBuild/Release ?
Aug 03 05:28:09 <mcrha>	tpopela, where is that directory, I do not have it in the WebKit root checkout
Aug 03 05:29:02 <tpopela>	mcrha, it is in the root checkout.. but only if you are using the WebKit build scripts (which you should use anyway (as I told you several times))..
Aug 03 05:29:49 <annulen>	mcrha: it's a default build dir of build-webkit, can be changed with WEBKIT_OUTPUTDIR variable
Aug 03 05:31:08 <mcrha>	okay, I do not have it, I call cmake manually, not through the "preferred way of building webkit"
Aug 03 05:32:19 <mcrha>	if I: `cp ../Source/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/* DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/`, then it starts building
Aug 03 05:32:45 <mcrha>	maybe the build-webkit does that in some way in the background; searching...
Aug 03 05:34:04 <mcrha>	ehm, `cp -r` is needed
Aug 03 05:34:17 <mcrha>	or not
Aug 03 05:34:34 <mcrha>	make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/builtins.py', needed by 'DerivedSources/WebCore/DOMWindowFetchBuiltins.cpp'.  Stop.
Aug 03 05:36:50 *	annulen never realized that Scripts get copied to ForwardingHeaders, that's amazing
Aug 03 05:38:49 <mcrha>	tpopela, do I checkout wrong branch?$ ls Tools/Scripts/webkitgtk-update-libs
Aug 03 05:38:49 <mcrha>	ls: cannot access 'Tools/Scripts/webkitgtk-update-libs': No such file or directory
Aug 03 05:39:12 <mcrha>	staying at git checkout root, of course
Aug 03 05:39:26 <tpopela>	mcrha, probably it is update-webkitgtk-libs
Aug 03 05:39:51 <mcrha>	right, that's there
Aug 03 05:40:26 <mcrha>	ble, jhbuild
Aug 03 06:22:45 <mcrha>	nah, it's all weird. I can `cmake ... && make stageSharedScripts && make`, but it fails later at:

Aug 03 06:36:09 <mcrha>	that will be something on my machine for sure, never mind and I'm sorry for bothering you with my own fault :-/

Aug 11 06:57:02 <CrazyLemon>	hey guys... does this look like webkitgtk bug https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/245 ?
Aug 11 06:59:21 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: Hrm. How much video memory do you have?
Aug 11 07:00:10 <CrazyLemon>	mrobinson well i have 7.4GB available ram..so integrated graphics is taking 512MB+ ?
Aug 11 07:00:20 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: Hrm.
Aug 11 07:00:45 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: It seems that even if you run out of video memory, your system shouldn't freeze...
Aug 11 07:01:00 <philn>	mrobinson: might be the IPC issues Carlos fixed recently?
Aug 11 07:01:17 <mrobinson>	philn: Do you have a link to those?
Aug 11 07:02:19 <philn>	i'd need to search in the git log
Aug 11 07:02:28 <CrazyLemon>	yea.. the freeze part is super annoying
Aug 11 07:02:43 <CrazyLemon>	SSH works but not really helpful since i can't kill webkit process
Aug 11 07:03:52 <annulen>	why?
Aug 11 07:04:30 <CrazyLemon>	process is/gets (?) defunct
Aug 11 07:05:31 <annulen>	kill -9?
Aug 11 07:05:39 <philn>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152316
Aug 11 07:05:52 <CrazyLemon>	-9 doesnt help..as i said you can't kill it :D
Aug 11 07:05:55 <CrazyLemon>	its a zombie process
Aug 11 07:08:14 <philn>	seems like a graphics driver issue, the patch i link above is more about fixing "too many files open" issues
Aug 11 07:11:26 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: Any sort of driver log could be helpful.
Aug 11 07:12:46 <CrazyLemon>	mrobinson i really hate freezing my system :D but yea..i'll give it a go and ssh into it a see what dmesg says about radeon
Aug 11 07:14:11 <CrazyLemon>	is this of any help https://paste.ubuntu.com/23013769/ ? this is currently in my dmesg
Aug 11 07:15:27 <annulen>	changing log level of kernel might help
Aug 11 07:16:38 <CrazyLemon>	so..level 8?
Aug 11 07:31:55 <CrazyLemon>	https://paste.ubuntu.com/23014217/ mrobinson is this helpful?
Aug 11 07:32:45 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: Does seem to be memory related somehow.
Aug 11 07:32:55 <mrobinson>	CrazyLemon: You don't see that at other times, do you?
Aug 11 07:33:19 <CrazyLemon>	mrobinson this is the first time i saw that msg
Aug 11 07:33:38 <CrazyLemon>	maybe had something to do with log level
Aug 11 07:34:42 <CrazyLemon>	but i have no issues other that with nuvola player/minibrowser & soundcloud
Aug 11 07:34:52 <CrazyLemon>	than*
Aug 11 08:45:26 <annulen>	by chance, is anybody aware of FTL crash fixes that are missing in 2.12 branch?

Aug 19 12:11:16 <JakeSays>	aperezdc: hey thanks!
Aug 19 13:25:11 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Somebody is complaining about a laggy WebKitWebView inside the GOA panel: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1367894
Aug 19 13:25:21 <rishi>	Have you seen this before?
Aug 19 13:25:23 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: Probably DRI3 + modesetting driver
Aug 19 13:25:35 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85064
Aug 19 13:25:41 <rishi>	Oh, right. I forgot about that.
Aug 19 13:25:42 <mcatanzaro>	There's a workaround in WebKitGTK+ 2.14
Aug 19 13:26:11 <rishi>	Do we enable DRI3 in Fedora?
Aug 19 13:26:14 *	rishi opens the bug
Aug 19 13:26:22 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: Yes, in some post-release F23 update
Aug 19 13:26:34 <annulen>	does 2.14 branch exist already?
Aug 19 13:28:26 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: I don't think so, no
Aug 19 13:28:54 <mcatanzaro>	It's (very slightly) late, probably KaL is busy. We've had no bugfix release since May either.
Aug 19 13:30:08 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: git grep LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE <- doesn't give me any hits. Tried both epiphany:f23 and epiphany:gnome-3-18. Makes me wonder why Ephy works fine with DDG.
Aug 19 13:30:16 <rishi>	Or did you mean F24 when you said "post-release F23 update"?
Aug 19 13:30:27 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: You are using the intel driver, this user is using the modesetting driver
Aug 19 13:30:40 <mcatanzaro>	I removed the LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE workaround some time after the Intel driver was fixed
Aug 19 13:30:52 <mcatanzaro>	Then after that, Fedora enabled the modesetting driver for some users with newer hardware
Aug 19 13:31:13 <rishi>	I see, ok.
Aug 19 13:31:29 <mcatanzaro>	At the time of that change, I complained that it would break WebKit, but nobody cared
Aug 19 13:31:34 *	mcatanzaro shrugs
Aug 19 13:31:48 <rishi>	I don't know the difference between modesetting and Intel drivers, except that the later is possibly used for Intel hardware. :)
Aug 19 13:32:06 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: KaL found the workaround after he noticed that in 2.14 *every* page was affected
Aug 19 13:32:27 <mcatanzaro>	rishi: I don't understand it either, but the intel driver is apparently obsolete
Aug 19 13:33:19 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Yes, I remember. I am CCed on the bug. I paged it out since my F23 systems were unaffected.
Aug 19 13:42:19 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: Thanks.

Aug 19 21:38:02 <MonkeyofDoom>	which LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE seems to help (webkit2gtk 2.12.3 here, building 2.13.4 presently)
Aug 19 23:48:24 <MonkeyofDoom>	yeah, 2.13.4 is 1fps scrolling on all pages w/o the env var
Aug 21 10:39:08 <Joao>	hey guys, was the create-plugin-widget signal really removed from webkit2gtk?
Aug 21 12:35:28 <Joao>	in that case, how can one embed a gtk widget into a webkitview?
Aug 21 23:43:56 <Joao>	and why don't widgets as object/embed cause the application to fail when the width is set to 100% of the container element?
Aug 21 23:44:45 <Joao>	the error reads something like: " Gdk-ERROR **: The program 'XXXXX' received an X Window System error. / This probably reflects a bug in the program. / The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'. /(Details: serial 1468258 error_code 11 request_code 53 (core protocol) minor_code 0) and more...
Aug 21 23:45:11 <Joao>	sorry, I meant height
Aug 21 23:45:15 <Joao>	width works like a charm
Aug 21 23:45:20 <Joao>	height is the one that screws it all
Aug 21 23:45:51 <Joao>	if I remove "height: 100%", it works, but can't get it to vertically auto-resize to the available space
Aug 21 23:47:04 <Joao>	and stranger even
Aug 21 23:47:10 <Joao>	I can resize the window to grow
Aug 21 23:47:18 <Joao>	but it doesn't allow me to shrink it
Aug 21 23:47:21 <Joao>	(with the mouse, I mean)
Aug 21 23:54:16 <MonkeyofDoom>	create-plugin-widget seems like it would have significant and confusing interaction with multiprocess architecture
Aug 21 23:54:21 <MonkeyofDoom>	as a reason for why it was removed
Aug 22 10:58:59 <garnacho_>	KaL: ping? I think you're a right guy to talk about wayland issues? :)
Aug 22 11:09:42 <KaL>	garnacho_: I'm back
Aug 22 11:11:25 <garnacho_>	KaL: hey :), I'm realizing mcatanzaro might be best, I had a look into the clipboard issues, and just found https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146574
Aug 22 11:11:42 <mcatanzaro>	Hi garnacho_
Aug 22 11:11:47 <KaL>	garnacho_: indeed, I'm only working on accelerated compositing stuff
Aug 22 11:12:28 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: oh! last time I tried to autocomplete you didn't seem to be here :)
Aug 22 11:12:53 <garnacho_>	KaL: nevermind then :)
Aug 22 11:14:15 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: so, reading that last comment, what was your approach to fixing this? I came to think that only proxying clipboard content to the ui process could work...
Aug 22 11:17:02 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: That's exactly what I'm trying. If you're interested in working on it, I haven't gotten very far; I have just a little work done on vacation a month or so ago
Aug 22 11:17:55 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: We already have cross-platform code for proxying clipboard content as it's how it works on macOS and iOS, but we have to reverse the logic in the GTK-specific files to use it
Aug 22 11:20:54 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: right, is it this PasteboardHelper I'm seeing? you already seem to do this to some extent for DnD
Aug 22 11:21:26 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: Yes. Which reminds me, trying to do DnD just causes the web process to crash :)
Aug 22 11:22:37 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho_: I just left another comment on the bug with a couple hints
Aug 22 11:23:33 <garnacho_>	mcatanzaro: thanks :). I'm jumping into vacation sometime this week, but nonetheless I think would be great to have this fixed for 3.22, might take time till I get to it, but I eventually will
Aug 22 11:24:12 <mcatanzaro>	yaaaaay :D
Aug 22 17:16:17 <Joao>	so, guys, any idea why I cannot reduce a window which has as only child a webkitgtk control?
Aug 24 04:00:32 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to KaL
Aug 24 04:00:43 *	KaL has changed the topic to: WebKitGTK+ stable: 2.12.4, unstable: 2.13.4 | Homepage: http://webkitgtk.org/ | http://ews-watcher.kov.eti.br/ |  http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTK/2.10.x | http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGTK/2.12.x | "HTML is useful for a web content rendering engine.

Aug 24 04:14:03 <blino>	magomez: hi, did you have time to get a look at bug 159928 ? (WebGL GPU-GPU copy)
Aug 24 04:14:37 <magomez>	not yet blino, but I'll try to do it this week
Aug 24 04:21:57 <blino>	great, thanks
Aug 24 16:32:28 <xjuan>	hello guys, is it possible to access a file url from a custom url scheme registered with webkit_web_context_register_uri_scheme() ?
Aug 24 16:32:52 <xjuan>	Received an unexpected URL from the web process: 'file://local.html/'
Aug 24 16:32:54 <xjuan>	Received an invalid message "WebPageProxy.DecidePolicyForNavigationAction" from the web process.
Aug 24 16:33:03 <xjuan>	that the error I get when I try to do so
Aug 24 16:58:27 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: You might have to try different security settings
Aug 24 16:58:53 <mcatanzaro>	There is an AllowUniversalAccessToFileURIs setting; if your app doesn't display any untrusted content, that might be the easiest solution
Aug 24 17:01:03 <xjuan>	ohh nice
Aug 24 17:01:12 <xjuan>	btw this is my test case in JS http://pastebin.com/yh3JNEbV
Aug 24 17:01:26 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: Try https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/unstable/WebKitSecurityManager.html#webkit-security-manager-register-uri-scheme-as-local
Aug 24 17:01:53 <xjuan>	I did, and that is when I get those errors
Aug 24 17:01:54 <mcatanzaro>	Unless you need to use that URI scheme from non-local pages, then it definitely won't work
Aug 24 17:02:12 <mcatanzaro>	Ah, you've already looked into this more than me, sorry. :(
Aug 24 17:02:18 <xjuan>	no the new scheme is local
Aug 24 17:02:47 <xjuan>	nono I am a webkitgtk newby so any help is much appreciated
Aug 24 17:03:20 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: Try flipping https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitSettings.html#WebKitSettings--allow-file-access-from-file-urls as well (though note that's definitely not secure if you allow loading arbitrary file URLs)
Aug 24 17:04:01 <mcatanzaro>	You can also try asking here earlier in the day, when European folks are active; more likely to get a response then. Worst case, it's not possible and requires new API....
Aug 24 17:04:22 <xjuan>	yeah I tried that one too
Aug 24 17:09:36 <xjuan>	mcatanzaro: thanks! I will ask tomorrow morning
Aug 24 19:04:50 <memeka>	Hi, does webkit2gtk uses gstreamer?
Aug 24 19:05:01 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Yes!
Aug 24 19:05:27 <memeka>	The system one or bundled?
Aug 24 19:05:36 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: System!
Aug 24 19:05:57 <memeka>	Decodebin?
Aug 24 19:06:14 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: I don't know!
Aug 24 19:06:37 <memeka>	I get YouTube crashing after the first frame in epiphany 3.20
Aug 24 19:07:21 <memeka>	Default decoder is v4l2 (hw accelerated exynos mfc)
Aug 24 19:07:36 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: That's sad, it works for me on Fedora 24 with WebKitGTK+ 2.12.3 and GStreamer 1.8.3
Aug 24 19:08:03 <mcatanzaro>	If you get a backtrace, then you can file a bug (bugzilla.webkit.org if you think it's a WebKit bug, bugzilla.gnome.org if you think it's a GStreamer bug)
Aug 24 19:08:28 <memeka>	I am assuming it's the decoder not the presentation
Aug 24 19:08:29 <mcatanzaro>	The GStreamer backend code is in Source/WebCore/platform/graphics/gstreamer if you're curious.
Aug 24 19:08:39 <memeka>	Although gst plays correctly
Aug 24 19:09:00 <memeka>	How can I get a trace of gst events?
Aug 24 19:13:21 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: I don't know! I think there is an environment variable. GST_TRACE? GST_DEBUG?
Aug 24 19:13:35 <memeka>	yes i think so, thx!
Aug 24 19:51:21 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: any idea why webGL in wayland is slow?
Aug 24 19:51:39 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: I didn't realize WebGL worked in Wayland!
Aug 24 19:52:21 <memeka>	well, chrome has a chrome://gpu page which shows all gpu details (including EGL extensions)
Aug 24 19:52:37 <memeka>	i could not find anything similar in webkit/epiphany
Aug 24 19:52:50 <mcatanzaro>	I don't think we have anything similar. Sounds like a cool thing to have!
Aug 24 19:53:07 <memeka>	but on a webgl info page, it showed it's compatible with webgl
Aug 24 19:53:16 <memeka>	and showed my GPU string
Aug 24 19:53:21 <memeka>	as opposed to MESA
Aug 24 19:53:28 <mcatanzaro>	I believe you, I just didn't know it was done!
Aug 24 19:53:35 <memeka>	(chrome in xwayland uses llvm mesa)
Aug 24 19:53:47 <memeka>	HOWEVER, webgl stuff is very slow
Aug 24 19:53:52 <memeka>	2-3 fps :)
Aug 24 19:54:08 <memeka>	so maybe it's not done :)
Aug 24 19:54:18 <memeka>	or at least, it's not zero-copy?
Aug 24 19:54:25 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Try running with LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE=1, does that help? If so it's fixed in this morning's release
Aug 24 19:58:42 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23086809/
Aug 24 19:59:08 <memeka>	so i think you were right, webgl is not working :) at least not accelerated :P
Aug 24 19:59:17 <memeka>	Major Performance Caveat:	Not implemented
Aug 24 19:59:19 <memeka>	:)
Aug 24 20:00:02 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder what's not implemented....
Aug 24 20:00:30 <memeka>	it gets the correct vendor, GL version, renderer etc
Aug 24 20:00:44 <memeka>	so it does read libEGL and libGLES
Aug 24 20:00:55 <memeka>	or at least gets them from wayland
Aug 24 20:10:33 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: yay now gstreamer HW decoder is being used
Aug 24 20:10:47 <memeka>	but the video is still not very fluid, i think it's the presentation layer?
Aug 24 20:13:04 <memeka>	either that, or it's scaling done in SW
Aug 25 03:09:25 <keis>	is there some way to get webkit_web_view_run_javascript to return a better error message?
Aug 25 03:10:17 <keis>	it only tells me "An exception was raised in JavaScript" which is not very helpful
Aug 25 03:40:16 <KaL>	keis: yes, we could expose the exception details parameter that we are currently ignoring, please file a bug report
Aug 25 04:02:30 <keis>	KaL: will do
Aug 25 04:02:40 <keis>	are you using the gnome bugzilla?
Aug 25 04:02:50 <KaL>	nope, webkit bugzilla
Aug 25 04:02:53 <keis>	kk
Aug 25 04:03:15 <KaL>	bugs.webkit.org WebKitGtk component
Aug 25 04:09:41 <keis>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161187
Aug 25 04:10:14 <keis>	also found that `window.location` fails like that while `""+window.location` works fine
Aug 25 04:10:22 <keis>	should I open a bug for that too?
Aug 25 04:20:58 <KaL>	sure
Aug 25 09:54:54 <xjuan>	morning guys
Aug 25 09:55:33 <xjuan>	I get the folowing error when I try to open a file:// scheme from a custom scheme like new://
Aug 25 09:55:41 <xjuan>	Received an unexpected URL from the web process: 'file://local.html/'
Aug 25 09:55:43 <xjuan>	Received an invalid message "WebPageProxy.DecidePolicyForNavigationAction" from the web process.
Aug 25 09:56:14 <xjuan>	http://pastebin.com/yh3JNEbV is a simple test case in JS

Aug 25 11:34:56 <KaL>	xjuan: that sounds like mixing different versions of UI and web process
Aug 25 11:35:59 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: No, it sounds like no sandbox extension was taken
Aug 25 11:36:29 <mcatanzaro>	The UI process just refuses to load file URLs from the web process if it hasn't seen them before, unless you change (something)
Aug 25 11:36:30 <KaL>	it's complaining about an invalid message
Aug 25 11:36:57 <KaL>	that could explain the unexpected URL not the invalid message
Aug 25 11:37:11 <mcatanzaro>	Hm
Aug 25 11:39:46 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: I just tried your test case and I'm not seeing those errors, actually
Aug 25 11:40:17 <mcatanzaro>	When I click the middle URL it prints:
Aug 25 11:40:19 <mcatanzaro>	decide-policy: new://local.html

Aug 25 11:40:23 <mcatanzaro>	decide-policy: new://local.html
Aug 25 11:41:50 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: I think the description for our https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/unstable/WebKitSettings.html#WebKitSettings--allow-universal-access-from-file-urls is outdated now, right? You can access local storage regardless of whether the setting is set now in 2.12.4, right?
Aug 25 11:43:04 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: nope, the description is the same
Aug 25 11:43:32 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: ah, well, the local storage part
Aug 25 11:49:02 <mcatanzaro>	KaL: The local storage part!
Aug 25 11:52:59 <KaL>	right, we can probably just omit that part
Aug 25 12:05:29 <xjuan>	mcatanzaro: sorry I was having lunch
Aug 25 12:06:55 <xjuan>	mcatanzaro: you get "CONSOLE ERROR Not allowed to load local resource: file:///home/xjuan/local.html" right?
Aug 25 12:07:06 <mcatanzaro>	No xjuan, I do not
Aug 25 12:07:16 <mcatanzaro>	What version of WebKitGTK+ do you have?
Aug 25 12:08:27 <xjuan>	pkg-config --modversion webkit2gtk-4.0
Aug 25 12:08:30 <xjuan>	2.12.3
Aug 25 12:08:34 <mcatanzaro>	Same as me
Aug 25 12:08:40 <xjuan>	using debian sid here
Aug 25 12:09:27 <xjuan>	btw I get the "Received an unexpected URL" error when I register the new scheme as local

Aug 29 11:47:29 <JeanLuc__>	hi, has anyone tested WebKit.WebView.load_html with a base_uri other than 'null' with the freshly released version 2.14.4?
Aug 29 11:47:56 <JeanLuc__>	sadly the webview is broken for me since the update =/
Aug 29 11:51:17 <KaL>	what does broken mean?
Aug 29 11:52:45 <JeanLuc__>	this is how it looks now: http://imgur.com/gallery/ZDqFs
Aug 29 11:53:17 <JeanLuc__>	and a picture with base_uri = 'null' to compare
Aug 29 11:53:43 <JeanLuc__>	both images and text used to work with base_uri = '/some/path'
Aug 29 11:54:57 <KaL>	I guess fonts are blocked by csp or something like that
Aug 29 11:55:24 <KaL>	or cross-origin checks
Aug 29 11:56:22 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: if you file a bug report with a simple test case in C to try, I can try to bisect to find the commit
Aug 29 11:56:24 <JeanLuc__>	csp? is there a workaround? is there anything I can do in my code (other than not using base_uri, which is kind of a deal-breaker for me)?
Aug 29 11:56:44 <JeanLuc__>	never written anything gobject in c =/
Aug 29 11:57:42 <JeanLuc__>	does generated c-code from vala work for you in this case?
Aug 29 12:01:23 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: as long as it builds it's fine
Aug 29 12:01:50 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: if there's a regression, I'll fix it and make a new release
Aug 29 12:12:30 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: could you open the inspector and check if there's any error in the js console?
Aug 29 12:29:47 <JeanLuc__>	KaL: how do i open the inspector?
Aug 29 12:29:57 <JeanLuc__>	KaL: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161313
Aug 29 12:30:26 <KaL>	right click, open inspector, you need to enable developer extras setting first
Aug 29 12:32:42 <JeanLuc__>	opened the insector, further instructions? :D
Aug 29 12:43:39 <KaL>	check the console
Aug 29 12:53:28 <JeanLuc__>	KaL: only a blue box with "Selected Element" and then the html-element that I selected below
Aug 29 12:53:42 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: in you exampole you are using literally file://some/path/
Aug 29 12:54:03 <KaL>	fonts in the article are using relative paths
Aug 29 12:54:17 <KaL>	and of course  file://some/path/assets/whateverfont
Aug 29 12:54:21 <KaL>	doesn't exists
Aug 29 12:58:11 <JeanLuc__>	KaL, totally forgot about the fonts (a webdesigner wrote the css for me), I will fix the css and close the bugs. Any idea why it worked before when it actually shuldn't? oO
Aug 29 12:59:50 <KaL>	no idea, I guess a security fix made the thing more strict
Aug 29 13:00:27 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: but, where are those fonts supposed to be located?
Aug 29 13:00:48 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: when using null those are ignored, I think, and fallbacks are probably used
Aug 29 13:00:55 <KaL>	that's why itworks
Aug 29 13:01:22 <JeanLuc__>	OOOkay :D, well big thank you for your time. I will fix it and close the bugs as soon as I'm done.
Aug 29 13:01:50 <KaL>	JeanLuc__: the thing is that if those are supposed to be local, then you should indeed use a base uri
Aug 29 13:01:59 <JeanLuc__>	no that's no what I meant, before 2.12.4 it used to work even with random base_uri paths
Aug 29 13:02:36 <KaL>	using random base_uri paths doesn't make any sense
Aug 29 13:02:54 <KaL>	if you don't load any local resource then simply use null
Aug 29 13:03:05 <JeanLuc__>	well, the path to where the images were stored, but not the fonts
Aug 29 13:03:08 <KaL>	and about:blank is automatically used as the base uri
Aug 29 13:03:18 <KaL>	ah
Aug 29 13:03:23 <KaL>	ok
Aug 29 13:05:06 <JeanLuc__>	Is there a way to have to locations from where resources can be loaded? The fonts are installed with the package (so most likely /usr/share/) but the images of the articles are downloaded into $HOME/.local/share/ of the user
Aug 29 13:05:22 <JeanLuc__>	... to have TWO locations ...
Aug 29 18:54:00 <brrian>	Hi folks. I am adding a derived sources phase to WebInspectorUI.
Aug 29 18:54:24 <brrian>	I think I can figure out the CMake needed, but just a heads up.
Aug 29 18:55:05 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: What could possibly go wrong! (sarcasm)
Aug 29 18:55:21 <mcatanzaro>	Good luck; if you can't make it work, we'll try to fix it tomorrow
Aug 29 18:55:35 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: I even have a VM :)
Aug 29 18:56:44 <brrian>	planning to move more of our messy perl script into actual build files now that Windows VS project is irrelevant
Aug 29 18:59:41 *	mcatanzaro can barely ready our Perl scripts
Aug 30 00:13:40 <memeka>	hi; what are the sinks used for video in wayland?
Aug 30 00:48:43 <memeka>	anyone?
Aug 30 02:41:45 <philn>	memeka: there's an internal video sink
Aug 30 02:42:08 <memeka>	philn: and that one is not EGL is it :(
Aug 30 02:42:11 <philn>	doesn't depend on the windowing protocol
Aug 30 02:42:22 <memeka>	it's very slow on wayland
Aug 30 02:42:40 <philn>	yep
Aug 30 02:42:41 <memeka>	is there a way to use the opengl sink (from gst-plugins-bad) ?
Aug 30 02:42:47 <philn>	yep
Aug 30 02:42:51 <memeka>	how? :D
Aug 30 02:43:31 <philn>	you would need to rebuild webkitgtk, setting the USE_GSTREAMER_GL option to ON
Aug 30 02:43:51 <philn>	it's disabled by default for now
Aug 30 02:46:19 <memeka>	philn: any plans to turn it on soon?
Aug 30 02:46:46 <philn>	it's declared in Source/cmake/OptionsGTK.cmake but i forgot how enable it without editing that file :)
Aug 30 02:47:23 <philn>	there's no date set in stone for the switch
Aug 30 02:49:11 <memeka>	philn: thx
Aug 30 02:49:17 <memeka>	i'll try to recompile
Aug 30 02:52:35 <memeka>	philn: it's gonna use the opengl sink from the system's gst, right? if it works with gst-launch-1.0 it should work in epiphany too ...
Aug 30 02:53:18 <philn>	memeka: not exactly, if you're building trunk we use an appsink there for GL video rendering
Aug 30 02:53:19 <memeka>	there;s also a gtksink, it's not gonna use that one, issit?
Aug 30 02:53:33 <philn>	but it's similar in behavior to glimagesink
Aug 30 02:53:47 <memeka>	not on my system :-S
Aug 30 02:54:16 <philn>	i mean the GL appsink is enabled if USE_GSTREAMER_GL is on
Aug 30 02:54:27 <memeka>	yes of course
Aug 30 02:54:30 <memeka>	just wanted to make sure
Aug 30 02:54:37 <memeka>	what sink exactly is gonna be used
Aug 30 02:54:43 <memeka>	gtksink, or glimagesink
Aug 30 02:54:53 <philn>	neither :)
Aug 30 02:55:02 <memeka>	(what's USE_GSTREAMER_MPEGTS?)
Aug 30 02:55:24 <memeka>	philn: where's the code then for this neither sink? :)
Aug 30 02:55:51 <philn>	the MPEGTS option is used for <track> element support iirc
Aug 30 02:56:04 <memeka>	platform/graphics/gstreamer/MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer.cpp ?
Aug 30 02:56:17 <philn>	MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase.cpp
Aug 30 02:56:32 <philn>	look for GSTREAMER_GL there
Aug 30 02:57:56 <memeka>	k, i see EGL and Wayland there :D
Aug 30 02:58:41 <memeka>	do i need to make sure COORDINATED_GRAPHICS_THREADED it's also ON?
Aug 30 02:59:35 <memeka>	looks like it's on based on ENABLE_OPENGL
Aug 30 03:00:28 <philn>	humm yes it might be needed
Aug 30 03:00:40 <memeka>	i saw it depends on ENABLE_OPENGL
Aug 30 03:00:48 <philn>	but i'm not sure the threaded compositor works under Wayland
Aug 30 03:00:53 <memeka>	and ENABLE_OPENGL depends on USE_GSTREAMER_GL
Aug 30 03:01:03 <memeka>	hm
Aug 30 03:01:17 <philn>	that's ok memeka, ENABLE_OPENGL is the general option for GL which includes EGL
Aug 30 03:01:47 <philn>	yoon: what's the status of threaded compositor in Wayland?
Aug 30 03:02:20 <philn>	perhaps KaL knows too :)
Aug 30 03:02:49 <memeka>	i'll wait until i start compiling then :) takes 7-8 hours on my system
Aug 30 03:06:40 <KaL>	philn: threaded compositor is now the default in both X11 and wayland
Aug 30 03:06:53 <memeka>	yay
Aug 30 03:07:05 <philn>	memeka: see you in 8 hours
Aug 30 03:07:09 <philn>	:)
Aug 30 03:07:26 <memeka>	KaL: is it good in webkit2gtk-2.12.3 ?
Aug 30 03:07:42 <memeka>	that's the one i has currently
Aug 30 03:07:50 <KaL>	no, it's current trunk that will be 2.14 in couple of months
Aug 30 03:08:05 <philn>	i'm not sure 2.12.3 has the latest appsink GL changes
Aug 30 03:08:11 <KaL>	or even earlier I don't remember the schedule :-P
Aug 30 03:08:20 <KaL>	no, I didn't merge those
Aug 30 03:08:47 <philn>	memeka: if you could try a trunk snapshot it would be better then
Aug 30 03:08:54 <memeka>	of course
Aug 30 03:09:23 <KaL>	current trunk doesn't build, give me some minutes to fix it
Aug 30 03:11:56 <memeka>	waiting to  svn checkout https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk WebKit2 :)
Aug 30 03:11:58 <foser>	KaL: schedule is in weeks i think? if it follows gnome release.. not sure if the new epiphany hard deps on 2.13
Aug 30 03:12:26 <memeka>	well, i will be using the ubuntu receipe to build it
Aug 30 03:12:33 <KaL>	foser: right, weeks :-)
Aug 30 03:12:43 <memeka>	so it will be seen as 2.12.3 :)
Aug 30 03:18:11 <memeka>	KaL: let me know when i can checkout
Aug 30 03:36:55 <KaL>	memeka: build is now fixed
Aug 30 03:38:36 <memeka>	KaL: thx, checking out now
Aug 30 03:38:54 <memeka>	i'll be back in many hours, compiling on ARM is not that fast :P
Aug 30 03:39:37 <philn>	memeka: you should cross-compile :)
Aug 30 03:39:44 <memeka>	naah
Aug 30 03:40:06 <memeka>	8 cores is reasonably fast
Aug 30 03:40:30 <memeka>	actually let's call them 4
Aug 30 03:40:48 <memeka>	cause 4 are stupid, and do more harm in using up the RAM
Aug 30 03:40:52 <memeka>	:)

Aug 30 13:04:58 <brrian>	how to clean just derived sources for one project?
Aug 30 13:40:12 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: For one subdirectory? You can try deleting just that directory manually; I think it should work
Aug 30 13:40:23 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: ok
Aug 30 13:40:33 <mcatanzaro>	e.g. WebKitBuild/Debug/
Aug 30 13:40:48 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: I'm making a separate CMakeLists.txt for WebInspectorUI, which at a minimum has the new derived sources generation command and a shared list of resources
Aug 30 13:40:59 <mcatanzaro>	Sorry, delete WebKitBuild/Debug/WebInspectorUI and I *think* they should be regenerated properly, rebuilding only the minimum number of things required
Aug 30 13:41:04 <brrian>	every CMake port seems to do something different with the files, so that stuff will be in the .cmake files
Aug 30 13:41:17 <brrian>	k
Aug 30 13:41:33 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: #webkit would probably be a better place to discuss this since all CMake folks will be there (e.g. alexchristensen)
Aug 30 13:41:40 <brrian>	yeah he's aware
Aug 30 13:41:50 <brrian>	apparently EFL runs its own minifier o_O
Aug 30 13:41:53 <brrian>	that could backfire
Aug 30 13:42:09 <mcatanzaro>	Just for the web inspector...?
Aug 30 13:42:12 <brrian>	well
Aug 30 13:42:15 <brrian>	UglifyJS
Aug 30 13:42:28 <brrian>	for Make based ports we run a perl script that minifies and combines stuff
Aug 30 13:42:41 <mcatanzaro>	Is minification really useful for the web inspector?
Aug 30 13:42:53 <brrian>	concatenation is way more important
Aug 30 13:43:07 <brrian>	otherwise WebCore has to spin through ~400 resource loads before showing anything
Aug 30 13:43:31 <brrian>	but minifying helps reduce parse times a little bit. on Mac we use a very simple minifier, no renaming or anything.
Aug 30 13:44:17 <brrian>	I don't know what the GResource stuff does, but if you want to improve load times it should be pretty easy to copy or reuse the perl script
Aug 30 13:47:35 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: It puts all the data inside the binary itself, in some fancy ELF location
Aug 30 13:47:43 <brrian>	ah I see
Aug 30 13:47:45 <mcatanzaro>	So there is no file opening
Aug 30 13:47:58 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: If you're curious: https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2012/01/26/resources-in-glib/
Aug 30 13:48:01 <brrian>	sure, but it still has to go through the network loader
Aug 30 13:48:26 <annulen>	brrian: are you talking about WebInspectorUI/Scripts/copy-user-interface-resources.pl? There is yet another script doing similar thing, JavaScriptCore/Scripts/inline-and-minify-stylesheets-and-scripts.py
Aug 30 13:48:37 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: nice link!
Aug 30 13:48:47 <brrian>	annulen: yeah, I'm starting to break that script up a bit
Aug 30 13:48:52 <annulen>	cool
Aug 30 13:48:59 <annulen>	I was tempted to use it in Qt
Aug 30 13:49:09 <brrian>	annulen: only Mac uses it afaik
Aug 30 13:49:17 <brrian>	I'm consolidating some CMake stuff
Aug 30 13:49:41 <annulen>	I know, and anyone trying to refactor it on pther platform will necessary break Mac things :)
Aug 30 13:50:31 <brrian>	heh
Aug 30 13:50:47 <brrian>	well most of what it does is easy enough to do in CMake or Make
Aug 30 13:51:00 <brrian>	and way easier to maintain
Aug 30 13:51:02 <brrian>	that way
Aug 30 13:53:10 <brrian>	annulen: pretty much all of the minification/combining should be independent of the port-specific resource packaging system.. the input is either a few combined files or a few hundred files from source
Aug 30 13:53:57 <annulen>	fully agree, if it doesn't require installing nodejs, like EFL approach :)
Aug 30 13:54:05 <brrian>	yeah, that's a nonstarter for us
Aug 30 13:54:13 <brrian>	and our minifier is much simpler little python script
Aug 30 13:54:42 <brrian>	btw, is there some rhyme or reason to using ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/Source/WebInspectorUI/... vs ${WEBINSPECTORUI_DIR}/...
Aug 30 13:55:02 <brrian>	the latter seems better, except SOURCES lists don't use prefixes usually
Aug 30 13:55:25 <mcatanzaro>	Probably no rhyme or reason, should probably standardize on WEBINSPECTORUI_DIR
Aug 30 13:55:30 <brrian>	k
Aug 30 13:56:31 <brrian>	another interesting difference is that on Mac, DerivedSources is usually flattened, whereas with CMake it seems to parallel the source layout
Aug 30 13:57:59 <brrian>	ugh.. is there some magic to make ubuntu have emacs line-oriented keybindings everywhere/ :P
Aug 30 13:58:42 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: There is a GTK+ setting for that actually... somewhere...
Aug 30 13:58:51 <brrian>	looks like
Aug 30 13:58:56 <brrian>	gnome-tweak-tools or something
Aug 30 13:59:00 <annulen>	one possible problem with minification: you have to inline everything into both Main.html and Test,html
Aug 30 13:59:21 <annulen>	so it becomes important to get rid of Test.html in production build
Aug 30 13:59:22 <brrian>	annulen: that's not what is done now
Aug 30 13:59:57 <brrian>	Main.html is normal and includes Main.js (which has 100's of files) and all the redundant includes are removed
Aug 30 14:00:04 <brrian>	the same for Test.html
Aug 30 14:00:19 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: in gnome-tweak-tool: Keyboard and Mouse -> Key theme -> Emacs
Aug 30 14:00:36 <mcatanzaro>	That's in GNOME 3.20, Ubuntu will have something older, but *probably* will be in the same place
Aug 30 14:00:52 <mcatanzaro>	(It will only work for GTK+ apps of course)
Aug 30 14:01:03 <brrian>	yeah
Aug 30 14:01:28 <brrian>	emacs bindings everywhere is one thing that OS X has done since NextStep probably, which I take for granted
Aug 30 14:01:38 <brrian>	I have fixed a few kill ring bugs in WebKit ;-)
Aug 30 14:01:39 <mcatanzaro>	Impressive
Aug 30 14:02:22 <mcatanzaro>	Yeah I remember someone (you?) talking about kill ring at the Contributors Meeting last year... I was more than a bit surprised to learn WebKit supports that
Aug 30 14:02:41 <mcatanzaro>	Anyway brrian some "good" news: emacs depends on WebKitGTK+ now
Aug 30 14:02:49 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: kill ring C-k C-y etc works in any Cocoa app
Aug 30 14:03:02 <mcatanzaro>	I do not know why, but the rumor I heard was so it could play videos
Aug 30 14:03:09 <brrian>	o_O
Aug 30 14:03:30 <brrian>	maybe it's necessary for EmacsOS
Aug 30 14:03:35 <brrian>	=P
Aug 30 14:03:59 <mcatanzaro>	They are using WebKit1 (very old/insecure WebKitGTK+ 2.4) though, so now I have the enviable task of proposing we remove Emacs from Fedora (won't happen, WK is an optional dependency) to get rid of WebKit1
Aug 30 14:05:11 <mcatanzaro>	Oh wow, looks like they switched to git, at long last....
Aug 30 14:05:13 <mcatanzaro>	http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git
Aug 30 14:05:59 <mcatanzaro>	http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/configure.ac#n2625 "Enable xwidgets if GTK3 and WebKitGTK+ are available."
Aug 30 14:06:17 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder what xwidgets are. And if I was gullible for believing videos. ;)
Aug 30 14:07:00 <brrian>	I tried to dual boot ubuntu on my fast new PC but the installer kernel panicked :(
Aug 30 14:07:06 <brrian>	so I'm doing this stuff back in my VM
Aug 30 14:07:19 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: Fedora!
Aug 30 14:07:31 <brrian>	yeah, I guess. :|
Aug 30 14:07:37 <brrian>	I have no allegiance
Aug 30 14:07:45 <mcatanzaro>	Fedora!
Aug 30 14:07:48 <brrian>	I do have fancy new hardware
Aug 30 14:08:11 <brrian>	well not that new, it's a Z170 chipset and a skylake i7
Aug 30 14:08:18 <mcatanzaro>	Ubuntu!
Aug 30 14:08:40 <mcatanzaro>	But seriously, Intel released a bad microcode update and it's apparently breaking Skylake laptops
Aug 30 14:09:00 <mcatanzaro>	You're safe on Ubuntu because Ubuntu doesn't update anything
Aug 30 14:09:00 <brrian>	I mean, how long does it take for Debian or Fedora or anyone to add a major Intel rev :) :P
Aug 30 14:09:17 <brrian>	not if the installer is borked
Aug 30 14:09:27 <mcatanzaro>	Oh yeah, you did just mention that
Aug 30 14:10:01 <brrian>	ok, sweet. the keybindings work
Aug 30 14:10:13 <brrian>	well, at least in GTK apps (not sublime)
Aug 30 14:13:03 <brrian>	heh. good ole CMake.
Aug 30 14:13:20 <brrian>	if I spent more time with it, it would be easier right? :P
Aug 30 14:13:34 <brrian>	Make is atrocious so I can't love it no matter how many hours
Aug 30 14:14:56 <annulen>	make is way more straightforward, flexible, never gets in your way
Aug 30 14:15:39 <brrian>	I agree with 1 and 2
Aug 30 14:15:41 <brrian>	not 3
Aug 30 14:15:49 <mcatanzaro>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/empathy/commit/?id=03ad9867f02aeb337d61b0b26ba687593bede9f0
Aug 30 14:15:55 <brrian>	or I guess, there are so many gotchas
Aug 30 14:16:22 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Have you been following meson?
Aug 30 14:16:44 <annulen>	not really
Aug 30 14:17:04 <mcatanzaro>	They're trying to be the next autotools/cmake replacement; got some traction with GStreamer and they're aiming for GNOME next
Aug 30 14:17:16 *	mcatanzaro intends to investigate it more seriously eventually
Aug 30 14:17:47 <annulen>	I was involved in premake some time ago
Aug 30 14:21:34 <brrian>	mcatanzaro: is there some concept of Engineering vs Production builds for webkitgtk?
Aug 30 14:21:52 <brrian>	there are some things we only usually include in builds from source, like the uncaught exception reporter
Aug 30 14:22:15 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: Yes, -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release vs. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
Aug 30 14:22:25 <mcatanzaro>	Also: -DDEVELOPER_MODE=ON
Aug 30 14:23:09 <brrian>	hmm, how would I convert that to ENGINEERING_BUILD? true if Debug or DEVELOPER_MODE=ON?
Aug 30 14:23:38 <brrian>	the combined Inspector.html.in uses ENGINEERING_BUILD macro just because that's what I know
Aug 30 14:23:42 <mcatanzaro>	Probably just if (DEVELOPER_MODE)
Aug 30 14:24:30 <mcatanzaro>	Debug vs. Release is more just about whether to compile debug info, or enable assertions, leak tracking of WebCore objects....
Aug 30 14:24:37 <brrian>	right
Aug 30 14:24:46 <brrian>	Mac port has a separate level above that
Aug 30 14:25:21 <mcatanzaro>	I forget what we use DEVELOPER_MODE for, probably for loading stuff from the current directory; that's probably what you want to use
Aug 30 14:25:33 <brrian>	ok!
Aug 30 14:34:31 <brrian>	annulen: do you know where the top-level ENABLE_WEBCORE, etc gets set?
Aug 30 14:34:50 <brrian>	I can't find it anywhere! don't know if ENABLE_WEBINSPECTORUI is necessary or just use ENABLE_WEBKIT2
Aug 30 14:35:46 <annulen>	brrian: OptionsXXX.cmake
Aug 30 14:36:00 <annulen>	but there is no ENABLE_WEBCORE afaik
Aug 30 14:36:15 <annulen>	oops, there is
Aug 30 14:38:21 <brrian>	so my new CMakeLists.txt isn't getting picked up.
Aug 30 14:38:31 <brrian>	but I added add_subdirectory to the top-level file
Aug 30 14:38:45 <mcatanzaro>	brrian: Strange, you might need to re-run cmake...?
Aug 30 14:39:00 <brrian>	well, I see it running again
Aug 30 14:39:06 <brrian>	maybe it's using some cached things
Aug 30 14:39:42 <annulen>	brrian: are you adding add_subdirectory to Source/CMakeLists.txt?
Aug 30 14:39:53 <brrian>	ya
Aug 30 15:08:25 <brrian>	annulen: now the file is picked up, but its definitions aren't accessible from OptionsGTK.cmake
Aug 30 15:08:30 <brrian>	o_O
Aug 30 15:10:23 <annulen>	brrian: it goes in reverse, OptionsGTK.cmake is visible everywhere
Aug 30 15:10:45 <brrian>	er, my bad
Aug 30 15:10:52 <brrian>	PlatformGTK.cmake in WebKit2
Aug 30 15:11:14 <annulen>	oh, they are separate from each other
Aug 30 15:11:22 <brrian>	can't see CMakeLists.txt in WebInspectorUI
Aug 30 15:12:49 <brrian>	I had kinda assumed all variables were global, maybe not
Aug 30 15:12:58 <annulen>	no, they aren't
Aug 30 15:13:20 <brrian>	I can move that particular rule to PlatformGTK.cmake in WebInspectorUI, then use the generated XML file from derived sources in WebKit2's PlatformGTK.cmake
Aug 30 15:13:33 <brrian>	now to figure out how the platform files get included.. :P
Aug 30 15:14:38 <annulen>	some time ago I tried to do similar thing in my fork for Qt port, but I gave up and ended up including WebInspectorUI/PlatformQt.cmake where resource are needed
Aug 30 15:16:10 <annulen>	https://github.com/annulen/webkit/commit/4dfce6e929322a61975b509663b55b46c445f10c
Aug 30 15:17:11 <brrian>	do the platform.cmake files just get automatically picked up?
Aug 30 15:17:15 <brrian>	can't see any refs
Aug 30 15:17:29 <annulen>	WEBKIT_INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILES_IF_EXISTS() pick them
Aug 30 15:17:46 <annulen>	if there is no WEBKIT_INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILES_IF_EXISTS in that dir, it's not picked :)
Aug 30 15:17:46 <brrian>	ahhhh
Aug 30 15:17:47 <brrian>	magics
Aug 30 15:17:48 <brrian>	ok
Aug 30 15:17:55 <brrian>	I wonder what that did
Aug 30 15:18:06 <brrian>	you folks are so helpful
Aug 30 15:18:34 <mcatanzaro>	My super key stopped working after I did something in gnome-initial-setup, I should be less helpful :(
Aug 30 15:18:45 <mcatanzaro>	Sorry, I meant gnome-tweak-tool
Aug 30 15:18:51 <mcatanzaro>	What did I change, I don't remember changing anything :(
Aug 30 15:22:09 <annulen>	brrian: btw, I use yet another script to bundle inspector files into resource file, qt resources are very similar but yet not 100% equivalent to glib resources, you can see its invocation in patch above
Aug 30 15:22:19 <brrian>	yeah I saw
Aug 30 15:22:41 <brrian>	so I have WebInspectorUI_RESOURCES
Aug 30 15:23:07 <brrian>	which include js, html, css. eventually that list would include combined files if needed
Aug 30 15:23:21 <brrian>	and the port-specific packager shouldn't care
Aug 30 15:23:35 <brrian>	it can filter out for JS or CSS or whatever if needs to do something special
Aug 30 15:24:01 <brrian>	as long as it searches WEBINSPECTORUI_DERIVED_SOURCES since that's where the combined files would go
Aug 30 15:25:12 <annulen>	I think we need shared list of inspector files + some switch what icon directory should be used
Aug 30 15:25:37 <annulen>	maintaining separate lists leads to omissions which go unnoticed
Aug 30 15:25:46 <brrian>	annulen: yeah, especially as I make things complicated
Aug 30 15:25:52 <brrian>	but can't each platform file append to the main list?
Aug 30 15:26:01 <annulen>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156165
Aug 30 15:26:12 <annulen>	yes
Aug 30 15:26:39 <brrian>	I need to find whoever does EFL and get them to use the shared list
Aug 30 15:26:42 <brrian>	it does something funky now
Aug 30 15:26:52 <annulen>	they grab everything
Aug 30 15:26:55 <annulen>	literally
Aug 30 15:27:29 <annulen>	look in Source/PlatformEFL.cmake
Aug 30 15:27:32 <brrian>	randomly minifying files with ES6 is probably not a good idea
Aug 30 15:27:35 <brrian>	yea I have it open
Aug 30 15:37:41 <brrian>	 Cannot find source file: /home/bburg/repos/webkit/OpenSource/WebKitBuild/Release/DerivedSources/WebInspectorUI/InspectorGResourceBundle.c
Aug 30 15:37:56 <brrian>	I appended it to WebKit2_DERIVED_SOURCES
Aug 30 15:38:19 <brrian>	the rule to create it is in WebInspectorUI/PlatformGTK.cmake, not sure why it can't see the reipe
Aug 30 15:38:21 <brrian>	recipe
Aug 30 15:41:27 <annulen>	brrian: you may need GENERATED property on that file
Aug 30 15:41:43 <annulen>	cmake is very dumb sometimes
Aug 30 15:43:31 <brrian>	didn't help.
Aug 30 15:44:43 <brrian>	maybe I need to add it to some dummy target in WebInspectorUI
Aug 30 15:45:43 <annulen>	be careful not to make it rebuilding on each run
Aug 30 15:46:35 <brrian>	something we have done in Make before is output a file with the contents of a list
Aug 30 15:46:50 <brrian>	to force it to invalidate when the list changes
Aug 30 15:47:47 <brrian>	add_custom_target(stageSharedScripts DEPENDS ${JavaScriptCore_SCRIPTS})
Aug 30 15:47:47 <brrian>	add_dependencies(JavaScriptCore stageSharedScripts)
Aug 30 15:47:52 <brrian>	that looks similar

Aug 31 19:27:15 <memeka>	i tried to compile webkit with USE_GSTREAMER_GL=ON and GLES2=ON, but there's a conflict with ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS
Aug 31 19:28:02 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Just an FYI, USE_GSTREAMER_GL and ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS are not supported
Aug 31 19:28:03 <memeka>	i commented out the WEBKIT_OPTION_CONFLICT(ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS ENABLE_GLES2) option, but many hours later => error compiling, redefinition of functions from GLX and GLES
Aug 31 19:28:24 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: my understanding was that it should work now, in trunk
Aug 31 19:28:49 <mcatanzaro>	Ah well the conflict is there for a reason, it means you have to pick one or the other. :)  ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS uses CairoGL, which I suppose requires OpenGL not OpenGLES...?
Aug 31 19:29:03 <mcatanzaro>	Why do you think it should work?
Aug 31 19:29:12 <memeka>	i disabled ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS  but something was still enabling it :(
Aug 31 19:29:30 <memeka>	because philn and KaL told me so
Aug 31 19:30:31 <memeka>	ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS should work with (APPEND CAIROGL_COMPONENTS cairo-egl)
Aug 31 19:30:36 <memeka>	instead of cairo-glx
Aug 31 19:30:52 <mcatanzaro>	Hmm, you'll probably want to ask them tomorrow then... I'm not sure why they'd say that, if we have a WEBKIT_OPTION_CONFLICT and it doesn't work with the conflict removed.
Aug 31 19:31:28 <memeka>	in any case, o set ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS  OFF, but it ends up ON anyway
Aug 31 19:31:30 <memeka>	dunno why
Aug 31 19:31:34 <mcatanzaro>	Keep in mind, they both use Debian, so they don't have access to CairoGL (it's disabled in Debian) and can't build with ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS themselves....
Aug 31 19:32:35 <memeka>	i have ubuntu, so it's the same
Aug 31 19:32:53 <memeka>	btw, how can i compile webkit to use system's cairo, gst, etc?
Aug 31 19:33:06 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: OK, are you using the build-webkit script, and update-webkitgtk-libs?
Aug 31 19:33:07 <memeka>	can i just skip Tools/Scripts/update-webkitgtk-libs ?
Aug 31 19:33:23 <memeka>	if i skip that, will it find the system libs?
Aug 31 19:33:28 <mcatanzaro>	It looks like build-webkit enables ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS
Aug 31 19:33:40 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Yes indeed
Aug 31 19:33:57 <mcatanzaro>	And update-webkitgtk-libs installs a version of Cairo with CairoGL support compiled
Aug 31 19:34:02 <mcatanzaro>	OK, so that's what's going on
Aug 31 19:34:07 <memeka>	rather, what's the proper way to build it? (ubuntu) ?
Aug 31 19:34:14 <memeka>	i used: https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/BuildingGtk
Aug 31 19:34:35 <memeka>	but update-webkitgtk-libs compiles its own libs - i want to use the system's installed ones
Aug 31 19:34:59 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: You probably don't want to use build-webkit or update-webkitgtk-libs unless you want to do development on WebKit itself. I would just run CMake directly; the instructions on that page are for developers.
Aug 31 19:35:30 <mcatanzaro>	'cmake -DPORT=GTK' should be enough (you probably also want to pass -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release or Debug)
Aug 31 19:35:32 <memeka>	k, so then just cd build; cmake  ..; make -j8 ?
Aug 31 19:35:46 <memeka>	k, thx!
Aug 31 19:35:48 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Yes. You can also pass -GNinja and use ninja instead of make, it will go faster
Aug 31 19:36:02 <memeka>	don't think i have ninja installed :D
Aug 31 19:36:50 <mcatanzaro>	You could also try: "build-webkit --disable-accelerated-2d-canvas" but I don't think you need to be using the build-webkit script
Aug 31 19:37:05 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: i want USE_GSTREAMER_GL because gst sink on wayland is software, very slow :(
Aug 31 19:37:16 <memeka>	i will try using cmake
Aug 31 19:38:31 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: I hope it works for you, just keep in mind that if it worked reliably, it would be enabled by default, or at least not a hidden option. So be prepared for broken stuff, patches welcome, etc. philn is the right person for questions about it.
Aug 31 19:38:56 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: thanks. this is what i'm trying: http://paste.debian.net/799304/
Aug 31 19:39:45 <mcatanzaro>	Oh you don't need to patch anything, use 'cmake -DUSE_GSTREAMER_GL=ON -DENABLE_GLES2=ON'
Aug 31 19:40:20 <mcatanzaro>	(ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS is already OFF if you use cmake directly, instead of build-webkit. It's build-webkit that was turning on experimental development features :)
Aug 31 19:41:34 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: thx
Aug 31 19:41:52 <memeka>	GStreamerGL is needed for USE_GSTREAMER_GL.
Aug 31 19:41:53 <memeka>	hmm
Aug 31 19:42:33 <mcatanzaro>	You need gstreamer-gl-1.0.pc
Aug 31 19:43:25 <memeka>	yup i was just installing it now :d
Aug 31 19:43:32 <memeka>	weird i  don';t have it
Aug 31 19:44:10 <mcatanzaro>	Hm, we don't have that .pc file anywhere in Fedora
Aug 31 19:45:33 <memeka>	it's gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad-dev in debian/ubuntu
Aug 31 19:45:34 <memeka>	http://paste.debian.net/799325/
Aug 31 19:46:09 <memeka>	i'll do ENABLE_X11_TARGET = OFF
Aug 31 19:46:15 <memeka>	it won't break stuff, will it? :D
Aug 31 19:46:37 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: It *should* work. It's supported. Does anybody ever test it? Will it actually work? Not sure. ;)
Aug 31 19:47:11 <memeka>	hm, i'll leave it in :)
Aug 31 19:47:33 <memeka>	you never know :)
Aug 31 19:47:51 <mcatanzaro>	Interesting, looks like Fedora just "enabled GLES support in GStreamerGL" in rawhide a couple weeks ago: http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free.git/commit/?id=6dbf8cb598b4617ca9c764477aa8606ccec5e272
Aug 31 19:48:20 <mcatanzaro>	So we have it, where is the .pc file...?
Aug 31 19:49:19 <mcatanzaro>	Ahha it's there, I just did  my search wrong. Irrelevant to you, you don't use Fedora, I'm just talking to myself on IRC....
Aug 31 19:52:10 <memeka>	:)
Aug 31 19:52:26 <memeka>	then maybe gst opengl sink may work
Aug 31 19:52:27 <memeka>	:D
Aug 31 19:53:49 <memeka>	mcatanzaro: do i have to make install as well, or can i use it in its build folder?
Aug 31 19:54:09 <memeka>	and also, do u know how to make epiphany work with non-system webkit? :D
Aug 31 19:54:13 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: If you're just testing MiniBrowser, you don't need to make install
Aug 31 19:54:29 <memeka>	how do i run MiniBrowser?
Aug 31 19:54:32 <mcatanzaro>	If you want Epiphany to work... my recommendation is to use GNOME JHBuild
Aug 31 19:55:44 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: Tools/Scripts/run-minibrowser --gtk
Aug 31 19:56:19 <memeka>	mcatanzaro i just want to test a youtube video with gstreamer - decoding is already accelerated on my system, but the sink was very slow (wayland SHM); gstreamer's opengl sink is very fast, so i want to check if it works in webkit; i can make later a nicely packaged ubuntu .deb
Aug 31 19:56:40 <mcatanzaro>	MiniBrowser is the easiest way to test it then
Aug 31 19:56:45 <memeka>	awesome
Aug 31 19:57:06 <memeka>	compiling w/o deps is SO much faster :))
Aug 31 19:57:33 <mcatanzaro>	Here are instructions if you want to use it with Epiphany: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web/Development
Aug 31 19:57:43 <mcatanzaro>	(Much easier to use MiniBrowser ;)
Aug 31 19:58:07 <memeka>	ah ok, so i need to build epiphany....
Aug 31 19:58:24 <memeka>	i can't just use existing one and use LD_LIBRARY_PATH or something ...
Aug 31 19:58:47 <mcatanzaro>	memeka: maaaaaybe!
Aug 31 19:59:15 <memeka>	i'll check that too :) but minibrowser is easier
Sep 01 05:47:23 <memeka>	anyone alive?
Sep 01 05:48:19 <philn>	hi memeka
Sep 01 05:48:26 <memeka>	there;s an issue
Sep 01 05:48:35 <memeka>	with GSTREAMER_GL
Sep 01 05:48:57 <memeka>	i am compiling with GLES2=ON, GSTREAMER_GL=ON, ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS=OFF
Sep 01 05:49:35 <philn>	what's the error?
Sep 01 05:49:45 <memeka>	well, first, i had to install cairo GL
Sep 01 05:50:03 <memeka>	then:
Sep 01 05:50:07 <memeka>	#if USE(CAIRO) && ENABLE(ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS)
Sep 01 05:50:07 <memeka>	#include <cairo-gl.h>
Sep 01 05:50:07 <memeka>	#endif
Sep 01 05:50:25 <memeka>	but, even without ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS, there's cairo GL functions used
Sep 01 05:51:00 <philn>	there's one possibly related bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=159562
Sep 01 05:51:41 <memeka>	that's not it
Sep 01 05:51:42 <memeka>	somehow
Sep 01 05:51:52 <memeka>	NativeImagePtr MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase::nativeImageForCurrentTime()
Sep 01 05:51:58 <memeka>	should return nullptr
Sep 01 05:52:12 <memeka>	#if !USE(CAIRO) || !ENABLE(ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS)
Sep 01 05:52:12 <memeka>	    return nullptr;
Sep 01 05:52:12 <memeka>	#endif
Sep 01 05:52:29 <memeka>	however
Sep 01 05:52:36 <memeka>	build fails few lines lower
Sep 01 05:52:46 <memeka>	at cairo_gl_device_set_thread_aware
Sep 01 05:54:32 <philn>	so you haven't correctly disabled the acc 2D canvas support
Sep 01 05:55:01 <memeka>	well
Sep 01 05:55:03 <memeka>	per the same file
Sep 01 05:55:09 <memeka>	cairo-gl is not included :))
Sep 01 05:57:35 <philn>	what's the cmake command line you use?
Sep 01 05:59:21 <philn>	and double-check the CMakeCache.txt correctly reflects the configuration you need
Sep 01 06:01:23 <memeka>	philn: cmake -DPORT=GTK -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_GSTREAMER_GL=ON -DENABLE_GLES2=ON -DENABLE_JIT=OFF -DUSE_SYSTEM_MALLOC=ON  -DENABLE_X11_TARGET=OFF -DENABLE_MINIBROWSER=ON ..
Sep 01 06:02:16 <philn>	add -DENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS=OFF
Sep 01 06:03:55 <memeka>	hm i am pretty sure actually i added that
Sep 01 06:03:59 <memeka>	sorry it was many hours ago
Sep 01 06:04:09 <memeka>	compiling takes ages :(
Sep 01 06:04:23 <memeka>	is there a log to check if it's ON?
Sep 01 06:04:57 <memeka>	cat CMakeCache.txt | grep CANVAS
Sep 01 06:04:58 <memeka>	ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS:BOOL=OFF
Sep 01 06:04:58 <memeka>	ENABLE_CANVAS_PATH:BOOL=OFF
Sep 01 06:04:58 <memeka>	ENABLE_CANVAS_PROXY:BOOL=OFF
Sep 01 06:06:50 <KaL>	memeka: check cmakeconfig.h
Sep 01 06:07:16 <philn>	ah but you still have USE(CAIRO) so it's normal the early return isn't triggered
Sep 01 06:07:34 <memeka>	yup
Sep 01 06:07:40 <memeka>	cat cmakeconfig.h | grep -i canvas
Sep 01 06:07:40 <memeka>	#define ENABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS 0
Sep 01 06:07:40 <memeka>	#define ENABLE_CANVAS_PATH 0
Sep 01 06:07:40 <memeka>	#define ENABLE_CANVAS_PROXY 0
Sep 01 06:07:47 <philn>	but the include isn't done, i see
Sep 01 06:07:52 <memeka>	yup
Sep 01 06:08:00 <memeka>	anw, i forced the include
Sep 01 06:08:05 <memeka>	hope it's gonna compile
Sep 01 06:08:18 <memeka>	just wanted to report this
Sep 01 06:08:35 <philn>	change that ifdef to #if USE(CAIRO) && ENABLE(GLES2) (or maybe ENABLE(OPENGL))
Sep 01 06:09:05 <philn>	can you file a bugreport please?
Sep 01 06:09:08 <memeka>	i just commented out the if :)
Sep 01 06:09:20 <memeka>	hm, where do i report?
Sep 01 06:09:29 <memeka>	(do i need to make account :-S)
Sep 01 06:09:30 <memeka>	:D
Sep 01 06:09:32 <philn>	bugs.webkit.org
Sep 01 06:10:00 <philn>	ok i'll just do it then
Sep 01 06:11:03 <memeka>	philn: thanks :)
Sep 01 06:11:29 <memeka>	i think there aren't many ppl that will hit this issue :))
Sep 01 06:12:46 <memeka>	is cairo-gl really gonna be used?
Sep 01 06:13:09 <memeka>	first time i hit this issue, i recompiled cairo with gl support
Sep 01 06:13:19 <memeka>	then i hit it again, hours later :))
Sep 01 06:13:30 <philn>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161482
Sep 01 06:13:36 <memeka>	philn: thanks
Sep 01 06:15:09 <philn>	that method is used only when a <video> element is used within webgl and/or canvas
Sep 01 06:17:45 <memeka>	anyway .. 2 days later, I'm @ 86% :)) never got this far
Sep 01 06:46:14 <memeka>	philn, KaL /mnt/src/webkit/Source/WebKit2/UIProcess/AcceleratedDrawingAreaProxy.cpp: In member function ‘void WebKit::AcceleratedDrawingAreaProxy::setNativeSurfaceHandleForCompositing(uint64_t)’: /mnt/src/webkit/Source/WebKit2/UIProcess/AcceleratedDrawingAreaProxy.cpp:271:129: error: ‘DispatchMessageEvenWhenWaitingForSyncReply’ is not a member of

Sep 01 06:46:21 <memeka>	any idea about this one?
Sep 01 06:46:53 <philn>	hum nope
Sep 01 06:48:19 <memeka>	it's the only IPC in that file
Sep 01 06:48:24 <memeka>	no idea where it comes from
Sep 01 06:48:45 <philn>	Source/WebKit2/Platform/IPC/Connection.h
Sep 01 06:49:26 <memeka>	Connection.h is not included there ... but maybe something else is including it
Sep 01 06:50:58 <memeka>	should i include it?
Sep 01 06:51:09 <memeka>	namespace IPC {
Sep 01 06:51:09 <memeka>	 
Sep 01 06:51:09 <memeka>	enum class SendOption {
Sep 01 06:51:09 <memeka>	    // Whether this message should be dispatched when waiting for a sync reply.
Sep 01 06:51:09 <memeka>	    // This is the default for synchronous messages.
Sep 01 06:51:10 <memeka>	    DispatchMessageEvenWhenWaitingForSyncReply = 1 << 0,
Sep 01 06:51:10 <memeka>	};
Sep 01 06:51:21 <philn>	sounds worth a try
Sep 01 06:52:15 <memeka>	or is it IPC::SendOption::DispatchMessageEvenWhenWaitingForSyncReply ?
Sep 01 06:52:28 <memeka>	sorry my C++ skills are towards 0 :)
Sep 01 06:53:04 <philn>	IPC::Dispatch... should work
Sep 01 06:54:53 <memeka>	can i just replace it with "1 << 0" ?
Sep 01 06:58:20 <KaL>	memeka: IPC::SendOption::DispatchMessageEvenWhenWaitingForSyncReply
Sep 01 06:58:37 <KaL>	it was converted ot an enum class
Sep 01 06:59:19 <KaL>	memeka: so, you are building without wayland and without redirected xcomposite window?
Sep 01 06:59:31 <memeka>	KaL: thx, thought so, but like i said, no C++ in many years
Sep 01 06:59:36 <memeka>	I am build WITH wayland
Sep 01 07:00:11 <memeka>	ENABLE_WAYLAND_TARGET:BOOL=ON
Sep 01 07:00:12 <KaL>	hmm, :SetNativeSurfaceHandleForCompositing should not be compiled in wayland, we need to fix that
Sep 01 07:00:40 <philn>	ah i was reading my old code instead of your pasted code, sorry
Sep 01 07:00:43 <KaL>	memeka: please, file bug reports for all this problems you are finding
Sep 01 07:00:57 <memeka>	philn ? :D :D :D
Sep 01 07:02:01 <philn>	memeka: seems like it's time for you to create a bugzilla account :)
Sep 01 07:02:16 <memeka>	goddamit
Sep 01 07:02:19 <memeka>	k :)
Sep 01 07:13:05 <memeka>	philn KaL : ource/WebKit2/UIProcess/gtk/AcceleratedBackingStoreWayland.cpp line 75
Sep 01 07:13:26 <KaL>	what
Sep 01 07:13:27 <memeka>	can i use that gdk_cairo_draw_from_gl ?
Sep 01 07:13:50 <memeka>	looks like i don't have GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH used few lines down
Sep 01 07:14:24 <KaL>	maybe we should use that conditionally
Sep 01 07:14:30 <KaL>	file a bug report for that too
Sep 01 07:14:32 <memeka>	not sure GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH is in EGL/GLES
Sep 01 07:14:50 <KaL>	so that's what we should fix
Sep 01 07:15:06 <memeka>	how can i fix it for now?
Sep 01 07:15:09 <KaL>	gdk_cairo_draw_from_gl will not work, it will render the texture inverted
Sep 01 07:15:23 <memeka>	is there a fix i can try?
Sep 01 07:15:33 <memeka>	instead of GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH ?
Sep 01 07:22:22 <memeka>	KaL ?
Sep 01 07:42:31 <KaL>	memeka: I don't know, i'm not opengl expert, file a bug report and I'll investigate
Sep 01 07:43:48 <KaL>	I saw the reports, thanks!
Sep 01 07:46:13 <annulen>	KaL: will there be 2.12.5?
Sep 01 07:46:42 <KaL>	annulen: I don't know, is there anything wrong with .4?
Sep 01 07:47:31 <memeka>	KaL: actually i found i have that in GLESv3 which is supported by my GPU
Sep 01 07:47:46 <KaL>	memeka: comment on the bug
Sep 01 07:47:50 <memeka>	so i just replaced GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH with 0x0D02 so as not to include gl3.h
Sep 01 07:47:54 <KaL>	any info will be useful
Sep 01 07:48:34 <annulen>	KaL: at least one patch is worthwhile to include, here is a backported version: https://github.com/annulen/webkit/commit/73bcc7a950eb5b66a76a774fa73dc70c824d4563
Sep 01 07:49:17 <KaL>	annulen: update the wiki then, please
Sep 01 07:49:37 <KaL>	I'll make nre releases as long as there are candiate commits to be moreged
Sep 01 07:49:41 <KaL>	*new
Sep 01 07:49:49 <KaL>	*mreged
Sep 01 07:50:00 <KaL>	ok, I don't know how to type
Sep 01 07:55:01 <annulen>	KaL: cool, thanks. btw I hope you can stumble upon something suitable when preparing 2.14.0 :)
Sep 01 08:14:52 <memeka>	KaL: build finished, run a youtube video - it's still slow :(
Sep 01 08:15:27 <memeka>	how can i check the GL sink is being used?
Sep 01 09:19:08 <memeka>	KaL, philn - pages don't load :(
Sep 01 09:26:07 <philn>	don't load or are not rendered?
Sep 01 09:26:25 <philn>	without any details it's a bit hard to guess what's going on
Sep 01 09:34:49 <memeka>	philn: don't load
Sep 01 09:35:06 <memeka>	Tabs are stuck with the loading icon
Sep 01 09:35:17 <memeka>	And nothing gets rendered
Sep 01 09:35:28 <philn>	memeka: what if you try a file:///path/to/some/webpage.html ?
Sep 01 09:36:06 <philn>	1
Sep 01 09:40:44 <memeka>	philn: nothing
Sep 01 09:44:58 <memeka>	philn: http://imgur.com/a/tOqJZ
Sep 01 09:45:36 <annulen>	I guess strace -e open would help
Sep 01 09:45:54 <annulen>	oops, forgot -f
Sep 01 09:46:12 <annulen>	does it read that file or not
Sep 01 09:46:13 <philn>	looks like the the web process is hanging?
Sep 01 09:49:08 <memeka>	philn: will try that tmr, late here :(
Sep 01 10:06:59 <tpopela>	KaL, Hi Carlos it looks like there is an DOM API breakage in 2.13.90 -> we are missing webkit_dom_html_element_insert_adjacent_text (instead there is webkit_dom_element_insert_adjacent_text )..
Sep 01 10:07:11 <tpopela>	KaL, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/418922/
Sep 01 10:09:22 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, ^
Sep 01 10:09:57 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Was it stable API...?
Sep 01 10:10:26 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, hmm that's a question.. probably not.. let me see.
Sep 01 10:10:43 <mcatanzaro>	You can just switch to the new function, right?
Sep 01 10:10:54 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, yep, unstable..
Sep 01 10:11:41 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, yes :).. until then the Evo will be broken with 2.13.90, but I can survive that ;)
Sep 01 11:04:24 <KaL>	tpopela: that's not a break, because that's not stable api
Sep 01 11:04:44 <tpopela>	KaL, yes I know.. I thought it was in stable ;)
Sep 01 11:04:55 <KaL>	tpopela: it was just moved to element
Sep 01 11:05:01 <KaL>	so it's easy to fix
Sep 01 11:07:50 <tpopela>	KaL, exactly.. already building a fixed version.. there was also another change for webkit_dom_html_element_insert_adjacent_html() and webkit_dom_dom_selection_set_base_and_extent().. Actually it's not that bad when you realize it is mostly caused by cdumez changing the DOM API to be specific compliant -> and that's a good thing..
Sep 01 14:07:58 <ManDay>	Does any of surf, midori or xombrero support current webkit?
Sep 01 14:08:13 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: No, those browsers are all insecure, don't use them
Sep 01 14:08:46 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: What do you mean by insecure? I'm currently using MiniBrowser - are you suggesting that is more safe?
Sep 01 14:09:44 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Yes, if it's the latest version of MiniBrowser (should say 2.12.4)
Sep 01 14:10:02 <mcatanzaro>	https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/03/on-subresource-certificate-validation/ is interesting
Sep 01 14:10:12 <mcatanzaro>	As is https://webkitgtk.org/security.html
Sep 01 14:10:47 <ManDay>	Thanks. I'm sure Midori will be fixed asap
Sep 01 14:10:58 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: No it won't
Sep 01 14:11:49 <ManDay>	I'm just looking for a lightweight Webkit browser. Actually I'm almost happy with minirbrowser, but I need some means of password completon and choosing the download folder
Sep 01 14:12:03 <mcatanzaro>	See: "I’ve been in touch with Midori, but they say they don’t have the resources to fix it, since it would require rewriting large portions of the code base in order to be able to use the fixed webkit." and: "I reported this to the Midori developers in late 2014" and: "t’s hard to understate how bad this is: it makes HTTPS completely worthless"
Sep 01 14:12:10 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: why you say that? midori is very actively improved
Sep 01 14:12:17 <ManDay>	oh
Sep 01 14:12:31 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: The thing is, MiniBrowser is just a developer testing tool, it will never grow any of those features. Epiphany is our real flagship browser.
Sep 01 14:13:06 <ManDay>	i assume epiphany is extremely heavy on deps and probably even requires X11
Sep 01 14:13:12 <ManDay>	but I'll have a look, thanks
Sep 01 14:13:40 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: The configure script currently requires X11, but that's a bug; it's not actually needed and would be simple to fix, if you want to send a patch
Sep 01 14:14:15 <ManDay>	ok. in any case I guess i have to compile from tarball because gentoo fucks up the deps, as usual
Sep 01 14:14:16 <mcatanzaro>	Just needs a new configure flag to skip the PKG_CHECK_MODULES checks. The code itself already has #ifdefs in (hopefully) all the right places
Sep 01 14:14:50 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: is there any simple way to test browser for this vulnerability?
Sep 01 14:14:53 <mcatanzaro>	FWIW you can compare midori development: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~midori/midori/trunk/changes
Sep 01 14:15:00 <mcatanzaro>	epiphany development: https://git.gnome.org/browse/epiphany/log/
Sep 01 14:15:23 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: For TLS subresource verification? Yes, there is a test page on Ryan's web site, linked from my blog post
Sep 01 14:15:28 <mcatanzaro>	Check your port :)
Sep 01 14:16:09 <ManDay>	Is this "JHbuild" thing really necessary to build epiphany?
Sep 01 14:16:14 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Here's the thing: with Midori you have >150 unfixed public vulnerabilities in WebKit. Epiphany uses newer WebKit, with 2.12.4 you have 0 unfixed public vulnerabilities. (Public meaning: announced. Probably there are many not public.)
Sep 01 14:16:36 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: No, it's not necessary. It's the easiest way to build the latest development version, but it's not want you want to build a Gentoo package.
Sep 01 14:17:09 <ManDay>	I want to build NOT from the gentoo packages. I want to build from upstream source. Gentoo is a fuckup for deps
Sep 01 14:17:13 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: as I expected, it's not vulnerable :)
Sep 01 14:17:21 <mcatanzaro>	:)
Sep 01 14:17:59 <mcatanzaro>	Anyway ManDay: to make Epiphany build without X11, what you want is to use pkg-config in the configure script to check GTK+'s pkg-config variables
Sep 01 14:18:10 <mcatanzaro>	There is a field in its pkg-config file that tells you what backends GTK+ was compiled with
Sep 01 14:18:18 <mcatanzaro>	We should check that variable and see if X11 is there
Sep 01 14:18:56 <mcatanzaro>	If not, we can remove the X11-specific PKG_CHECK_MODULES calls as we already don't use X11 stuff in that case
Sep 01 14:19:10 <mcatanzaro>	You should only need to modify configure.ac and nothing else
Sep 01 14:19:53 <ManDay>	my experience with autotools is limited at best but Ill try
Sep 01 14:24:57 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: You want to use the PKG_CHECK_VAR macro. It's documented in man pkg-config(1)
Sep 01 14:25:17 <manday1>	Not a day goes by without shit crashing down on me...
Sep 01 14:26:09 <mcatanzaro>	manday1: You want to use the PKG_CHECK_VAR macro. It's documented in man pkg-config(1)
Sep 01 14:26:35 <manday1>	mcatanzaro: First, I have to get there. epiphany git requires me to go bleeding edge on a lot of packages
Sep 01 14:27:06 <mcatanzaro>	manday1: Should only require new WebKit. You can revert that need, too, one sec
Sep 01 14:27:23 <mcatanzaro>	It needs GTK+ 3.20 also but that's been out for five months now, hardly bleeding edge
Sep 01 14:28:24 <manday1>	mcatanzaro: First thing I hit was getting a new gettext version
Sep 01 14:28:35 <mcatanzaro>	https://git.gnome.org/browse/epiphany/log/embed/web-extension/ephy-web-overview.c <-- there are four commits there that deal with a WebKit unstable API break, you can just revert them and then lower the WebKit requirement in configure.ac
Sep 01 14:28:36 <manday1>	which apparently is more difficult than it sounds - because that breaks other packages
Sep 01 14:28:43 <mcatanzaro>	Oh yeah new gettext, that's true
Sep 01 14:29:01 <manday1>	my webkit is bleeding edge, no problem there
Sep 01 14:29:11 <manday1>	2.13.4 or what it is
Sep 01 14:29:13 <mcatanzaro>	jhbuild would handle all these deps for you :-)
Sep 01 14:29:41 <mcatanzaro>	manday1: So the other browsers you mentioned earlier are all incompatible with webkit > 2.4
Sep 01 14:29:43 <manday1>	hah, i won't let some stray wannabe package manager mess with my system. i rarely let portage mess with it
Sep 01 14:29:51 <manday1>	mcatanzaro: i know, thus my initial question
Sep 01 14:30:39 <mcatanzaro>	manday1: You could build from the gnome-3-22 branch instead of master. That's what we're releasing as stable later this month. master won't be stable until March.
Sep 01 14:30:48 <mcatanzaro>	And that branch doesn't require new gettext
Sep 01 14:31:23 <manday1>	oh good
Sep 01 14:32:38 <manday1>	I'm so bloody pissed how many crashes I get. If it weren't for tmux I could practically forget about doing *anything* in wayland
Sep 01 14:46:50 <ManDay>	mcatanzaro: with gnome-3-22 I get a syntax error in configure
Sep 01 14:47:11 <ManDay>	on AX_IS_RELEASE(git-directory)
Sep 01 14:47:39 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: You need autoconf-archive installed (or m4-common from GNOME git, which is a subset of autoconf-archive)
Sep 01 14:48:03 <ManDay>	oh dear... why cant just everyone use cmake
Sep 01 14:48:13 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: We're talking about meson now
Sep 01 14:48:43 <ManDay>	hm?
Sep 01 14:49:05 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: http://mesonbuild.com/
Sep 01 14:49:36 <ManDay>	but why not cmake
Sep 01 14:51:11 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Very old debate. It's not really THAT much nicer than autotools and people already know how to use autotools. It makes uninstall difficult, it makes tarball generation difficult, find modules are way worse than pkg-config, we'd have to rewrite a bunch of support macros (which meson already has)....
Sep 01 14:51:33 <mcatanzaro>	If we were gonna switch to CMake, it would have happened 10 years ago
Sep 01 14:52:31 <ManDay>	then I'd be happy if you stick with autotools. yet another build system? no thanks ;-( (though only personal opinion)
Sep 01 14:53:32 <ManDay>	configure.ac:63: error: macro APPSTREAM_XML is not defined; is a m4 file missing?
Sep 01 14:53:35 <ManDay>	/usr/share/aclocal/ax_require_defined.m4:35: AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED is expanded from...
Sep 01 14:53:36 <ManDay>	configure.ac:63: the top level
Sep 01 14:53:38 <ManDay>	y
Sep 01 14:53:46 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: You need appstream-glib
Sep 01 14:56:23 <ManDay>	why do I get those weird errors of configure.ac failing instead of proper errors *by* configure where it tells me that a package could not be found?
Sep 01 14:57:53 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: In the dark ages before AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED (i.e. last year) the error message was totally inscrutable, at least now you know a macro is missing. ;)  APPSTREAM_XML is required to build appdata files so it should be required by all GUI apps. jhbuild takes care of it for you. ;)
Sep 01 14:58:20 <mcatanzaro>	Of course, if you don't have autoconf-archive already, then using AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED doesn't help :D
Sep 01 15:00:06 <ManDay>	sorry but from the ignorant user's perspective (that is, mine) this is a mess. I'd expect that when I run autogen every error in autogen is a developer error and the missing dependencies are properly reported by ./configure
Sep 01 15:00:18 <ManDay>	ok... sorry for the pointless complaint
Sep 01 15:00:30 *	mcatanzaro shrugs
Sep 01 15:00:39 <mcatanzaro>	AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED is the new best practice
Sep 01 15:00:45 <mcatanzaro>	Used to be worse!
Sep 01 15:03:57 <ManDay>	I have no clue of autotools and I should not need to to compile anything.
Sep 01 15:05:41 <ManDay>	now YELP_HELP_INIT is missing
Sep 01 15:06:08 <ManDay>	ok, this looks like autotools will, through obscure error messages, coerce me into installing the whole gnome bundle
Sep 01 15:06:30 <ManDay>	not gonna happen though
Sep 01 15:06:43 <ManDay>	thanks mcatanzaro but I guess I'll have to stay with minibrowser
Sep 01 15:07:35 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: You need yelp-tools... it's for building the user help ;)
Sep 01 15:08:00 <mcatanzaro>	I'm pretty sure that's the last dependency btw, you've made it to the bottom of the configure script!
Sep 01 15:08:26 *	mcatanzaro actually looks at configure script
Sep 01 15:08:39 <mcatanzaro>	OK you haven't, but the rest is all pkg-config dependencies
Sep 01 15:09:21 <ManDay>	thanks, but just so I understand this:
Sep 01 15:09:37 <ManDay>	autoconf complains about a missing dependency, and NOT the configure script?
Sep 01 15:09:39 <ManDay>	why?
Sep 01 15:10:22 <mcatanzaro>	ManDay: Because you are missing m4 macros needed to generate the configure script. If you were building from a release tarball, instead of from git, the macros would already be in the tarball and the configure script would already be generated
Sep 01 15:10:39 <mcatanzaro>	Since you're building from git, you need to install developer tools needed to generate the configure script
Sep 01 15:11:01 <mcatanzaro>	We don't want to carry the same boilerplate macros around in each GNOME repo for generating documentation or appdata files, instead we just expect you to install them once
Sep 01 15:12:01 <ManDay>	ok, but this kind of stuff would not happen with a buildsystem like cmake, right? In Cmake, a program depends on modules/packages and thats it. You would depend ony Yelp and if its not installed cmake gives you proper error
Sep 01 15:12:13 <ManDay>	this is autotools crappy design
Sep 01 15:12:37 <ManDay>	you were right
Sep 01 15:12:41 <ManDay>	it passed now
Sep 01 15:13:33 <ManDay>	but now comes the whole bunch of deps that I'm not willing to take from the configure script
Sep 01 15:14:01 <ManDay>	gnome-desktop-3.0 libsecret libnotify etc
Sep 01 15:14:14 <mcatanzaro>	libsecret is for the password storage you wanted ;)
Sep 01 15:14:42 <mcatanzaro>	gnome-desktop-3.0 is for snapshots, to display the pages in the overview; it doesn't actually install a desktop, it's just some shared APIs
Sep 01 15:14:48 <mcatanzaro>	libnotify is for HTML desktop notifications
Sep 01 15:15:41 <ManDay>	yeah i know. but next I need gnome-keyring which is again 2 page of deps (including X11) at least in portage and so on
Sep 01 15:15:52 <ManDay>	this is just going to be too painful
Sep 01 15:16:20 <ManDay>	it's probably possible in theory, just not pratically for me ;-(
Sep 01 15:16:46 <ManDay>	Thanks anyway. getting to the configure script at least I know I can do it now
Sep 01 15:16:57 <ManDay>	though cleaning out the deps will take a week at least
Sep 01 15:17:29 <annulen>	you should have used jhbuild instead
Sep 01 15:18:04 <ManDay>	annulen: and what would that have done? just installed all the messy deps with X11 etc, right? Then I could aswell use what is in portage
Sep 01 15:18:30 <ManDay>	which will pull in approx 100 packages and requires a lot of fixing of the current USE flags
Sep 01 15:18:40 <ManDay>	anyway, thanks
Sep 01 15:19:06 <ManDay>	i got to sleep now. probably i have more energy to do this tomorrow :)
Sep 01 15:21:14 *	mcatanzaro continues with life
Sep 02 03:22:21 <bertogg>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1320240
Sep 02 03:22:25 <bertogg>	is this a known upstream bug?
Sep 02 03:47:35 <tpopela>	bertogg, yes this is basically the same thing from 2.4.x and even before..
Sep 02 03:48:12 <tpopela>	bertogg, ah this one was different.. sorry..
Sep 02 03:48:41 <tpopela>	bertogg, this is gcc 6.x thing..
Sep 02 03:49:34 <tpopela>	bertogg, and only with WK1..
Sep 02 03:51:11 <bertogg>	only wk1 ?
Sep 02 03:51:24 <bertogg>	ok...
Sep 02 03:51:45 <bertogg>	I'll rebuild it then
Sep 02 04:01:10 <tpopela>	bertogg, I'm not sure with the WebKit2 from 2.4.x as we are not building it from there..
Sep 02 04:03:39 <bertogg>	tpopela: what's the affected version then?
Sep 02 04:04:06 <bertogg>	one user just told me that he's also affected
Sep 02 04:04:32 <tpopela>	bertogg, we are applying it on any 2.4.x release that is being compiled with gcc 6.0+
Sep 02 04:06:48 <bertogg>	well, we still have 2.4.x and we're using gcc 6 now afaik

Sep 05 10:20:41 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: Let's stop using autokarma on non-critical WebKit updates, so each update gets a week in updates-testing. That would have caught the network process hang in 2.12.4.  (But let's still use it for this update, since 2.12.5 is critical to fix that hang. ;)
Sep 05 10:21:14 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, Hi :).. ok, I have no problem with that :)
Sep 05 11:01:10 <mcrha>	hi/ping mcatanzaro, I'm running the 2.13.90 release and it's crashing here on the webview close on the WebProcess side with this backtrace: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/422322/ I found one semi-related https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157973 but it looks like being already applied in the 2.13.90. Are you aware of anything similar, any changeset I would try locally?
Sep 05 11:01:50 <mcrha>	to be precise, it's the last WebView of that WebProcess, when it crashes.
Sep 05 11:02:11 <mcatanzaro>	mcrha: Please open a new bug, this crash is different
Sep 05 11:03:22 <mcrha>	mcatanzaro, sure, will do. Thanks
Sep 05 11:07:35 <mcrha>	mcatanzaro, here you are: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161605
Sep 05 14:37:39 <Dodji>	Hello
Sep 05 14:38:29 <mcatanzaro>	Hi Dodji, libwebkitgtk-1.0.so doesn't exist upstream anymore, so the ABI is not going to break
Sep 05 14:39:48 <mcatanzaro>	I don't think any functions should be exported unless they start with the webkit_ prefix, that's concerning. If you find any such functions in modern WebKit it might be worth reporting a bug. (But that ancient WebKit isn't supported anymore, don't bother reporting it.)
Sep 05 14:39:59 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: I just want to detect when the ABI *changes*, so that people can know what the changes are, just by looking at the binary.  It doesn't necessarily have to 'break' ...
Sep 05 14:40:19 <mcatanzaro>	Dodji: There won't be any ABI changes ever, because it will never be updated... :)
Sep 05 14:40:24 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: so that is the name of the *.so of the "new" webkit?
Sep 05 14:40:59 <mcatanzaro>	No, libwebkitgtk-1.0.so is WebKit1 for GTK+ 2
Sep 05 14:41:12 <Dodji>	ahh
Sep 05 14:41:13 <Dodji>	right
Sep 05 14:41:26 <mcatanzaro>	The only supported version that gets updated is webkit2gtk-4.0 (WebKit2 for GTK+ 3)
Sep 05 14:41:49 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: I see, thanks
Sep 05 14:41:54 <Dodji>	I'll look at that one
Sep 05 14:42:22 <mcatanzaro>	If you find an ABI break there, with the exception of the unstable portion of the DOM API, then please do file a bug
Sep 05 14:42:50 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: how do I know what the unstable part is?
Sep 05 14:43:18 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: I mean, the tooling is going to just look at functions that start with "webkit_" (at least in Fedora)
Sep 05 14:44:04 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: okay, just so you know, the tooling I am talking about is based on libabigail https://www.sourceware.org/libabigail/
Sep 05 14:45:37 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: There is now tooling in Fedora so that whenever a package is updated, we perform a deep comparison of the ABI of the new version of the package against the ABI of the last "stable" version.
Sep 05 14:45:49 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: that is meant to detect incompatible ABI changes.
Sep 05 14:46:44 <mcatanzaro>	Dodji: That's excellent! Unfortunately I doubt it will be possible to automatically detect which APIs are unstable and which aren't; you have to define a preprocessor macro to get the declarations, but the APIs will still be exported of course....
Sep 05 14:46:47 <Dodji>	but then webkit is one of the biggest c++ libraries around, with tons of exported stuff (at least for the ancient webkit).  So the game is to limit the scope of the comparison to stuff that make sense.
Sep 05 14:47:23 <mcatanzaro>	The unstable APIs are all going to be removed or stabilized before F26 is released, so that's good going forward. But in the meantime....
Sep 05 14:47:37 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: no problem (re unstable).  The main idea is to enable maintainers to *review* the ABI changes, you know, the way people review source code changes.
Sep 05 14:48:11 <mcatanzaro>	Dodji: OK, that's great then, if we get some warning about the ABI change without failing the package build
Sep 05 14:48:15 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: but in this case, the kind of change reports are going to be like this one: https://sourceware.org/libabigail/manual/abidiff.html#usage-examples
Sep 05 14:48:24 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: please look for "abidiff" in that page
Sep 05 14:48:40 <mcatanzaro>	FYI: I'm proposing to remove the webkitgtk (providing libwebkitgtk-1.0.so) and webkitgtk3 packages
Sep 05 14:48:41 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: see the ABI change report I am talking about?
Sep 05 14:48:54 <Dodji>	<mcatanzaro> Dodji: OK, that's great then, if we get some warning about the ABI change
Sep 05 14:48:55 <Dodji>		     without failing the package build
Sep 05 14:48:59 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: sure, that is the idea.
Sep 05 14:49:00 <mcatanzaro>	Yeah, that looks cool
Sep 05 14:49:35 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: and of course, the package maintainer can define "tight" rules to help detect what ABI change doesn't matter ets
Sep 05 14:49:36 <mcatanzaro>	It looks smart!
Sep 05 14:49:37 <Dodji>	etc
Sep 05 14:49:48 <Dodji>	so that the tool won't report that kind of changes anymore
Sep 05 14:50:01 <Dodji>	but I need to start with some sensible defaults :-)
Sep 05 14:50:36 <Dodji>	so for libwebkitgtk, the default is going to be "drop functions that don't start with 'webkit_' :-)
Sep 05 14:50:38 <Dodji>	"
Sep 05 14:50:45 <Dodji>	I hope that is going to be sensible enough.
Sep 05 14:50:50 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: thank you a lot
Sep 05 14:50:52 <mcatanzaro>	Dodji: What else is getting exported?
Sep 05 14:50:59 <Dodji>	man, a lot of stuff :-)
Sep 05 14:51:08 <mcatanzaro>	:(
Sep 05 14:51:08 <Dodji>	(in webkit-1.0)
Sep 05 14:51:21 <Dodji>	there are even c++ functions in the WTF:: namespace that are exported
Sep 05 14:51:31 <Dodji>	geoclue stuff
Sep 05 14:51:43 <mcatanzaro>	Anything C++ being exported is definitely a bug :D
Sep 05 14:51:53 <mcatanzaro>	Anyway, we have a different build system now, maybe that's cleaned up... maybe.
Sep 05 14:52:33 <Dodji>	I'll keep you posted about what I find :-)
Sep 05 14:52:57 <Dodji>	<mcatanzaro> It looks smart!
Sep 05 14:52:59 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: thanks!
Sep 05 15:05:16 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: btw, the task that performs the ABI verification in Fedora is https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Taskotron/Tasks/abicheck
Sep 05 15:05:23 <mcatanzaro>	Taskotron!
Sep 05 15:05:40 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: when the support for webkit is done, you can opt-in, asking for webkit-based stuff to be abi-verified too.
Sep 05 15:06:28 <Dodji>	for now, there is a white list of packages that are abi-verified and webkit-based packages are not in the white list yet.
Sep 05 15:07:14 <Dodji>	mcatanzaro: taskotron indeed :-) and there is a particular taskotron task that uses libabigail for abi comparison.
Sep 05 15:07:49 <Dodji>	if we can handle webkit, chances are that we can handle any library out there ;-)
Sep 05 15:08:52 <mcatanzaro>	Famous last words :P
Sep 05 15:08:54 <Dodji>	I'll have to handle qtwebkit too, sorry. :-)
Sep 05 15:37:43 <annulen>	Dodji: feel free to ping me if you need to know something about qtwebkit
Sep 05 15:49:14 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PWDXAEDWCST66E5B2WTYKSFH22CH56TQ/
Sep 05 15:50:53 <Dodji>	annulen: thanks!
Sep 05 15:55:13 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: is there any deadline when you need final release?
Sep 05 15:55:42 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: No, everything QtWebKit has been horrible for years, a little longer makes no difference
Sep 05 15:55:54 <mcatanzaro>	But sooner is better, of course-
Sep 06 02:57:10 <lantw44>	Can I propose https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/205341 to be merged for 2.14 branch here?
Sep 06 02:57:42 <lantw44>	It seems that I don't have permission to edit the wiki page ...
Sep 06 03:04:48 <KaL>	lantw44: added
Sep 06 03:05:23 <lantw44>	KaL: thanks!
Sep 06 06:33:20 <em->	I feel rather dumb because I keep forgetting: did I miss some flags to `webkit-patch upload` to add the bug number to changelogs when creating a new bug (with style-bot now complaining on bug #161622), or support for creating new bugs in  `webkit-patch upload` is not really functional? do you usually upload patches manually or just create the bug manually and then use `webkit-patch upload`?
Sep 06 06:34:34 <em->	oh, nevermind, https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115934
Sep 06 06:42:49 <annulen>	em-: I create bug, pass its number in prepare-Changelog -b, then commit to git and run webkit-patch upload -g. Is there more ergonomic way?
Sep 06 06:45:44 <philn>	i do a similar thing but using git-bz to upload the patch
Sep 06 06:51:52 <em->	annulen, webkit-patch seem to be able to create a bug itself if no bug already exist, but sadly it failed to update the changelogs with the newly created bug number
Sep 06 06:52:54 <em->	philn, mh, indeed I'm more comfortable with git-bz, but then I guess you'll need to manually set the "review?" tag on the patch, right?
Sep 06 06:55:02 <philn>	em-: yes, i use git-bz attach -n -e and uncomment the flags i need in the editor
Sep 06 06:55:53 *	philn added flags support in git-bz a few years back, heh :)
Sep 06 06:59:01 <em->	philn, ooh, shiny!
Sep 06 06:59:17 <philn>	http://git.fishsoup.net/cgit/git-bz/commit/?id=146ec9c0f35d8ea1494d3f400bffbd9fcde7f5d4
Sep 06 06:59:21 *	em- will try git-bz next time
Sep 06 07:10:57 <em->	philn, oh, wait, you mean that you create the bug separatedly, so git-bz would behave more or less the same than `webkit-patch upload`
Sep 06 07:11:33 <philn>	yes
Sep 06 08:48:14 <em->	thanks anyhow :)

Sep 08 09:41:04 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: hey :), fyi I got some working code shuffling clipboard management.
Sep 08 09:41:28 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho clipboard hero :)
Sep 08 09:42:00 <garnacho>	:), I've got a couple of questions though
Sep 08 09:43:10 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: do you know if I can pass enums through the .messages.in plumbing? assuming yes, where would you recommend to define those if they need to be visible all the way from Pasteboard to PlatformPasteboard?
Sep 08 09:43:31 <mcatanzaro>	Hmmmm, I will investigate
Sep 08 09:45:13 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: cheers :), right now I'm passing selection(primary/clipboard) and mimetype as strings, surely sounds like there's a better way when we expect a limited set for both
Sep 08 11:53:55 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: just attached the patch to get things going, feel free to chime in :)
Sep 08 11:54:04 <mcatanzaro>	Thanks garnacho!
Sep 08 11:54:12 <mcatanzaro>	I will look and try to find an answer for the enum issue
Sep 08 11:54:40 <mcatanzaro>	They probably get automatically serialized to ints, I would expect
Sep 08 11:58:14 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: yeah I'd assume so, I guess it's more about where can I put those so they are widely available with no layering violations
Sep 08 11:58:40 <mcatanzaro>	I'll think about it, KaL will probably know off the top of his head though
Sep 08 12:06:37 <KaL>	there's encodeEnum decodeEnum methods in Decoder/Encoder classes
Sep 08 12:07:11 <KaL>	I'll look at the patch tomorrow, too late for me today
Sep 08 12:42:46 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: Have you noticed that clicking the close button on a GtkNotebook can cause two tabs to close at once? As if the click is being registered twice. I think it's a recent regression, maybe in GTK+?
Sep 08 12:52:37 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: hmm, haven't seen that tbh
Sep 08 13:30:15 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: https://paste.gnome.org/pzuck4npy
Sep 08 13:30:32 <mcatanzaro>	You were probably using a release build? :)
Sep 08 13:31:08 <mcatanzaro>	It's m_clipboard, not m_gtkClipboard
Sep 08 13:31:18 <garnacho>	could well be
Sep 08 13:32:24 <mcatanzaro>	It's a good idea to use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug when developing, so you get asserts and debuginfo
Sep 08 13:32:46 <mcatanzaro>	We have debug fission now, so that doesn't make it super slow to build anymore
Sep 08 13:33:10 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: couldn't afford debuginfo on this laptop :), too little disk space and memory
Sep 08 13:33:17 <mcatanzaro>	OK
Sep 08 13:46:40 <mcatanzaro>	OK garnacho, next one: https://paste.gnome.org/pkqevjqsa
Sep 08 13:46:48 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder what a "key function" is
Sep 08 13:48:41 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho, I'm not sure what the error means, but the functions you added there should probably be pure virtual regardless, and I bet that would make it go away
Sep 08 13:49:23 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: hmm, I see this = 0; in the vfuncs for the other platforms
Sep 08 13:49:33 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: key function is a first virtual function in declaration
Sep 08 13:50:13 <mcatanzaro>	Ah yeah, so the problem is you didn't implement the functions, they all really do need to be pure virtual :)
Sep 08 13:50:16 <mcatanzaro>	that's the = 0
Sep 08 13:50:34 <annulen>	you can add implementation even for pure virtual function
Sep 08 13:50:38 <mcatanzaro>	I wonder why you were able to build it garnacho
Sep 08 13:50:43 <annulen>	to make vtable anchored
Sep 08 13:50:54 *	garnacho gets lost in c++ parlance :)
Sep 08 13:50:56 <mcatanzaro>	There's no point though, it's in a PLATFORM(GTK) guard
Sep 08 13:51:01 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: me too tbh
Sep 08 13:51:10 <garnacho>	thanks for spotting those
Sep 08 13:52:21 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: The = 0 requires subclasses to implement the function. It's like setting a pointer to
Sep 08 13:52:23 <mcatanzaro>	NULL
Sep 08 13:53:10 <annulen>	with difference that setting pointer to nullptr doesn't trigger any compilation errors when it's used :)
Sep 08 14:35:04 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: any more build errors? I applied the fixes locally and it (still) builds/runs fine here
Sep 08 14:35:19 <garnacho>	as soon as you confirm, I'll update the patch :)
Sep 08 14:35:36 <mcatanzaro>	No garnacho, I built it successfully. But I have to finish typing your review before I can switch to Wayland to test it. Almost done!
Sep 08 14:36:04 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: ah sure, no worries :)
Sep 08 14:37:11 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: known issue: pasting from primary into webkit is opted out in wayland, I've got https://paste.gnome.org/pciioqwm7 locally too
Sep 08 14:38:06 <garnacho>	but that's perhaps a too wide shot, doesn't tell much about the compositor actually implementing primary selection
Sep 08 14:38:42 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: Yeah, I changed that at the web engines hackfest a couple years ago, since Wayland didn't have primary selection at the time
Sep 08 14:39:54 <mcatanzaro>	I think it's probably fine to say it's always supported there... nothing horrible is going to go wrong if we do so, right?
Sep 08 14:40:20 <mcatanzaro>	It's not like GTK+ is going to somehow crash the compositor if the compositor doesn't support primary selection and we try to use the PRIMARY clipboard.
Sep 08 14:41:09 <mcatanzaro>	But yeah, it would be ideal to actually check whether it's really supported; we'd just want to cache the result there to avoid doing IPC every time that innocuous-looking function is called.
Sep 08 14:41:11 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: not like that, should double check what happens if you do gtk_clipboard_wait_for_contents() if there's no backing selection though
Sep 08 14:41:21 <mcatanzaro>	Oh
Sep 08 14:41:33 <mcatanzaro>	OK, I posted your review, gonna log into Wayland to try it now
Sep 08 14:44:01 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: I see (WebKitWebProcess:7437): Gdk-WARNING **: Wayland compositor does not support xdg_shell interface, not using Wayland display
Sep 08 14:44:08 <mcatanzaro>	Is that fallout from the xdg_shell version bump?
Sep 08 14:44:47 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: it is :(, gtk+ master just works (not sure if there was release in between)
Sep 08 14:45:07 <mcatanzaro>	I'll rebuild GTK+ then
Sep 08 14:47:00 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: Still seeing those warnings with GTK+ master
Sep 08 14:47:17 <mcatanzaro>	Clipboard works though :P
Sep 08 14:48:11 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: well, it should follow the same paths now on both x11/wayland :)
Sep 08 14:48:21 <garnacho>	I guess it's falling back to x11 if you get that warning though
Sep 08 14:49:22 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: I'm thinking, if you get that warning, it's perhaps that you already had gtk+ at xdg_shell v6 but mutter is still at v5?
Sep 08 14:49:48 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: Yes, I'm using mutter 3.20
Sep 08 14:50:18 <garnacho>	ah, looks like it then
Sep 08 14:50:28 <mcatanzaro>	When you said "Gtk+ master just works" I thought you meant it supported both versions, oh well
Sep 08 14:50:47 <mcatanzaro>	I'll try downgrading GTK+
Sep 08 14:52:06 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: I hear you, now that kde got xdg_shell v5 support :P
Sep 08 15:02:22 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: "pure virtual method was called" is a bad problem. I've looked over your patch and I don't see where the mistake is though
Sep 08 15:02:56 <mcatanzaro>	My guess is object slicing somewhere: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/274626/what-is-object-slicing
Sep 08 15:03:09 <mcatanzaro>	But I've never seen this error ever before
Sep 08 15:05:27 <mcatanzaro>	OK, with older GTK+ and actually using the Wayland backend now, it works. Great.
Sep 08 15:06:22 <garnacho>	yay :)
Sep 08 15:08:57 <mcatanzaro>	(The "pure virtual method called" is probably what's causing the "terminate called without active exception")
Sep 08 15:18:20 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: uhm... weird that those errors don't happen on MiniBrowser
Sep 08 15:18:33 <garnacho>	at least here
Sep 08 15:20:39 <mcatanzaro>	garnacho: And they don't happen for me since I rebooted my computer. Quite strange.
Sep 08 15:20:54 <garnacho>	uh, indeed
Sep 08 15:20:59 <mcatanzaro>	I guess we can just ignore it until the next time they show up. Maybe not related to your patch at all....
Sep 08 15:21:10 <mcatanzaro>	It was happening for me in ephy tab at shutdown.
Sep 08 15:21:22 <mcatanzaro>	Great work fixing this btw, this will make a lot of people happy besides me :)
Sep 08 15:22:41 <garnacho>	mcatanzaro: yw :), I'll stay second in queue :P
Sep 08 17:36:39 <zaitor>	garnacho: yay - patch working :-)
Sep 08 17:38:06 <garnacho>	zaitor: nice :), thanks for testing
Sep 08 17:38:25 <zaitor>	nah, thanks for producing it!
Sep 08 17:39:11 <zaitor>	that is one major roadblock for wayland by default removed, so good job
Sep 08 17:41:45 <garnacho>	cheers!

Sep 13 12:11:01 <KaL>	mcatanzaro: "When gtk_clipboard_set_with_data() success clearClipboardContentsCallback takes the ownership of data, so we leak it here."

Sep 16 03:45:33 <KaL>	tpopela, bertogg: current trunk doesn't build with gcc 4.9, would it be a problem for debian/fedora if we bump GCC requirements to 5?
Sep 16 03:46:12 <tpopela>	KaL, no problem for us on Fedora..
Sep 16 03:47:27 <tpopela>	KaL, we have 5.3.1 on F23 (the oldest supported release)..
Sep 16 03:47:56 <KaL>	cool
Sep 16 03:48:32 <tpopela>	KaL, do you have some bug with the issue mentioned?
Sep 16 03:48:46 <KaL>	not yet
Sep 16 03:49:01 <KaL>	or do you mean the gcc bug?
Sep 16 03:49:11 <KaL>	https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60511
Sep 16 03:49:38 <tpopela>	KaL, gcc bug is fine, thanks!
Sep 16 03:52:25 <tpopela>	KaL, btw do we have https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/205462 in 2.14? I'm curious how bad https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/205998 would be..
Sep 16 03:54:10 <KaL>	tpopela: yes, please add that one to the wiki

Sep 20 10:34:47 <mcatanzaro>	Hm, we have settings exposed for media stream and WebRTC, but not for plain old video playback
Sep 20 10:34:50 <mcatanzaro>	:(
Sep 20 10:35:11 <mcatanzaro>	I bet a patch exposing whatever setting you need in WebKitSettings would be welcome
Sep 20 10:35:34 <xjuan>	yes I am looking into it
Sep 20 10:40:03 <xjuan>	btw is there any replacement in webkit2gtk for the old create-plugin-widget signal?
Sep 20 10:40:15 <xjuan>	other than creating an actual plugin I guess
Sep 20 10:41:31 <mcatanzaro>	I don't think so, you can't use real GtkWidgets anymore at least
Sep 20 10:44:06 <xjuan>	that explains why its not implemented in the new API :D
Sep 20 10:45:24 <xjuan>	ok good, so I guess a plugin is the only option to handle a custom object element
Sep 20 10:51:40 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: One or two people have tried sending messages from the web process to the UI process and using that to draw widgets on top of the web view with GtkOverlay, so it's possible, but a bad idea as there's visible delays when scrolling
Sep 20 10:53:05 <annulen>	if npapi plugins work somehow, it should be possible to draw widgets in the same manner
Sep 20 10:53:37 *	annulen haven't investigated how npapi works in wk2 yet
Sep 20 10:57:25 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: NPAPI is drawn in the web process, you've no access to GTK+ stuff there
Sep 20 10:57:54 <mcatanzaro>	Also FYI: NPAPI plugins can't draw anything in Wayland, only plugins with no UI work
Sep 20 10:59:15 <xjuan>	I see, what about the new plugin api, PPAPI?
Sep 20 10:59:26 *	xjuan does not even know if that is supported in webkit2
Sep 20 10:59:51 <mcatanzaro>	That's Chrome-only
Sep 20 11:00:19 <mcatanzaro>	I doubt we'd ever support it, Apple would have to admit that Google did something well. And nobody wants to support plugins anymore.
Sep 20 11:01:10 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: there is https://github.com/i-rinat/freshplayerplugin
Sep 20 11:01:22 <annulen>	it's a translation layer between PPAPI and NPAPI
Sep 20 11:01:40 <annulen>	in theory we could integrate it deeper
Sep 20 11:07:21 <mcatanzaro>	I think we don't want to :P
Sep 20 11:07:53 <xjuan>	hehe right I do not want to be held accountable for bringing that up :P
Sep 20 11:08:32 <xjuan>	mcatanzaro, so are npapi plugin ever going to be supported in wayland?
Sep 20 11:10:12 <mcatanzaro>	xjuan: They are already supported if they don't draw anything. Plugins that draw stuff can never be supported because it depends on X11 :P
Sep 20 11:11:13 <xjuan>	well I knew some plugins used xembed, but npapi plugins works on windows so...
Sep 20 11:11:56 <xjuan>	I would not expect X11 plugins to work, but a wayland npapi plugin should
Sep 20 11:12:53 <xjuan>	but yeah, who is going to write wayland NPAPI pluggins
Sep 20 11:12:54 <xjuan>	:D
Sep 20 11:25:21 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: I see you handled the Epiphany updates, thanks!
Sep 20 11:26:17 <mcatanzaro>	Your WebKit builds finished in koji so it should be possible to build the Epiphany updates now
Sep 20 11:27:03 <blino>	KaL_out: magomez: hi, that's weird, the gstreamer backend does not build anymore for me since the sharedDisplay changes

Sep 20 11:27:50 <magomez>	blino yes, I have that in my todo
Sep 20 11:28:09 <mcatanzaro>	blino: Are you working on GStreamerGL?
Sep 20 11:28:24 <blino>	mcatanzaro: yes, with WebKitForWayland
Sep 20 11:28:39 <blino>	BTW, we did a YouTube 360 demo at IBC on our set-top boxes
Sep 20 11:28:59 <blino>	thanks all for providing solid pieces for this :)
Sep 20 11:29:11 *	mcatanzaro wishes YouTube 360 worked in WebKitGTK+
Sep 20 11:29:21 <blino>	mcatanzaro: it does
Sep 20 11:29:31 *	mcatanzaro wishes he could play >360p YouTube video in WebKitGTK+
Sep 20 11:29:35 <magomez>	blino, just remove the const in MediaPlayerGStreamerBase.cpp at line 238
Sep 20 11:29:44 <blino>	magomez: ok, thanks
Sep 20 11:29:44 <mcatanzaro>	blino: It definitely does not, at least not in the current stable release?
Sep 20 11:30:10 <mcatanzaro>	I had to switch to Firefox to get this year's snoop dawg april fools joke to work.
Sep 20 11:30:34 <mcatanzaro>	*snoop dogg
Sep 20 11:31:10 <blino>	mcatanzaro: with the GPU-GPU WebGL patch I have pending (working on a resubmit after magomez review), that should be better
Sep 20 11:31:42 <mcatanzaro>	blino: It depends on GStreamerGL? (When will we be able to enable that?)
Sep 20 11:37:42 <blino>	mcatanzaro: not sure if GST_MAP_GL would work otherwise, but it will perform better if video frames come as GL textures
Sep 20 11:38:56 <magomez>	mcatanzaro VideoSinkGStreamer doesn't use opengl rendering anymore
Sep 20 11:39:25 <magomez>	that's only done with GStreamerGL enabled
Sep 20 11:40:37 <mcatanzaro>	magomez: Do you have any plans to enable GStreamerGL in WebKitGTK+? You've been working on it?
Sep 20 11:41:40 <magomez>	mcatanzaro I did some work, but not sure when it's gonna be enabled by default
Sep 20 11:42:01 <magomez>	maybe KaL or philn know better
Sep 20 11:42:16 <mcatanzaro>	magomez: I doubt KaL knows much about it, we rely on you to tell us when it's stable
Sep 20 11:42:25 <KaL>	indeed!
Sep 20 11:42:27 <mcatanzaro>	(you and philn)
Sep 20 11:42:49 <KaL>	I'm fine to enable it whenever you consider it's stable enough
Sep 20 11:43:14 <mcatanzaro>	Now would be a good time actually, at the start of the development cycle, rather than the end
Sep 20 11:43:16 <magomez>	I'll discuss it with philn then and come back to you ;)
Sep 20 11:43:54 <mcatanzaro>	Thanks
Sep 20 11:44:27 <mcatanzaro>	You need to be the ones to decide because you'll be getting the bug reports if you choose wrongly :P
Sep 20 11:44:48 <magomez>	lol :P
Sep 20 12:11:44 <blino>	mcatanzaro: I am running SnoopaVision in 1080s
Sep 20 12:13:09 <mcatanzaro>	blino: It is the best possible conference demo, no?
Sep 20 12:14:39 <blino>	SnoopaVision ? not so sure :)
Sep 20 12:14:59 <blino>	there are racing videos like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRTnWZxTeQs
Sep 20 12:15:15 <blino>	I think there is a Rihanna concert in 360 somewhere around on YouTube, can't find it right now
Sep 20 12:15:39 <mcatanzaro>	blino: In 2.12.5 it says "360° video playback is not supported on this browser."
Sep 20 12:16:17 <mcatanzaro>	And anything over 360p is unavailable, with a link to https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6322658?visit_id=1-636099849476989668-1699397936&p=missing_quality&rd=1
Sep 20 12:16:52 <blino>	here is my run command: ./Tools/Scripts/run-minibrowser --gtk --enable-write-console-messages-to-stdout=true --enable-mediasource=true --enable-webgl=true --user-agent "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3l6mM3qVzk&index=2&list=PLbpi6ZahtOH4TalzBzHHczrUgJL7vsDdG"
Sep 20 12:17:09 <blino>	build command is: ./Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --gtk --no-media-stream --cmakeargs="-DUSE_GSTREAMER_GL=ON"
Sep 20 12:17:59 <blino>	I am not sure why we need to force the user agent, from what I read in the (obfuscated) YouTube JS, it was supposed to already handle correctly the original agent
Sep 20 12:20:48 <mcatanzaro>	OK, so we need two build settings that are currently disabled, and a user agent hack, thanks
Sep 20 12:24:16 <blino>	mcatanzaro: aren't MSE and WebGL enabled in epiphany by default?
Sep 20 12:24:39 <mcatanzaro>	blino: WebGL is indeed, I misread it as GStreamerGL.
Sep 20 12:24:47 <mcatanzaro>	MSE is not, that's why we are stuck on 360p
Sep 20 12:25:11 <mcatanzaro>	You need an unsupported build flag to turn on MSE, -DENABLE_MEDIA_SOURCE=ON. philn taught me this yesterday :)
Sep 20 12:25:30 <annulen>	I think it's safe to enable it by default since it has runtime setting
Sep 20 12:25:35 <blino>	hmm, not, with build-webkit, maybe for the pure cmake build
Sep 20 12:25:47 <annulen>	--media-source
Sep 20 12:25:50 <mcatanzaro>	Yeah, build-webkit enables experimental features, you don't want to use that in production
Sep 20 12:41:34 <blino>	mcatanzaro: not sure how we can avoid the user agent hack, we could try to contact someone at YouTube to get more details
Sep 20 12:42:53 <mcatanzaro>	blino: It's probably hopeless, we'll just always send Chrome to youtube.com
Sep 20 12:43:05 <mcatanzaro>	I'm going to do this for all Google domains anyway
Sep 20 12:43:07 <mcatanzaro>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142074
Sep 20 12:43:29 <mcatanzaro>	I'll try to deal with that next week-
Sep 20 12:46:14 <annulen>	oh, I wasn't aware that youtube requires ua hacks
Sep 20 15:53:53 <rave_>	If I load a blank error page or anything, just running the gtklauncher takes more than 100MB of RAM
Sep 20 15:54:03 <rave_>	does anybody know what could be the reason?
Sep 20 16:41:44 <mcatanzaro>	rave_: gtklauncher isn't supported anymore, time to move on to WebKit2....
Sep 20 16:49:14 <zaitor>	Hi upstream, I got no idea how to file this bug, so I'm just going to give you a screenshot
Sep 20 16:49:26 <zaitor>	https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Ed7A63EN/Skjermdump%20fra%202016-09-20%2022-47-56.png
Sep 20 16:49:54 <zaitor>	both evolution and epip does this when in wayland
Sep 20 16:50:50 <rave_>	mcatanzaro: oh ok but we are still using it... not sure if anybody knows the legacy system?
Sep 20 16:51:26 <mcatanzaro>	Hm zaitor, I just told DimStar in #gnome-hackers that it looked like a WebKit bug, but that doesn't look like a WebKit bug at all
Sep 20 16:51:33 <mcatanzaro>	(now that I see your screenshot)
Sep 20 16:52:21 <mcatanzaro>	Well maybe
Sep 20 16:53:12 <rave_>	mcatanzaro: it is not related to gtklauncher, even if I use bare minimum API the lib takes too much of RAM
Sep 20 16:53:21 <zaitor>	All I can say is that it's just evo and epip showing the behavior yet - granted they may only be the "messengers"
Sep 20 16:53:39 <rave_>	even with cache model set to DOCUMENT_VIEWER
Sep 20 16:53:41 <mcatanzaro>	Not other WK2 apps? Not yelp?
Sep 20 16:53:47 <zaitor>	let me try
Sep 20 16:53:50 <rave_>	even with no page loaded
Sep 20 16:54:02 <DimStar>	yelp does it too
Sep 20 16:54:05 <zaitor>	yelp does the same indeed
Sep 20 16:54:12 <zaitor>	and DimStar beat me to it
Sep 20 16:54:42 <DimStar>	zaitor: :) sorry - I did not find the channel (I missed the '+' in the name at first)
Sep 20 16:54:49 <mcatanzaro>	rave_: See https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/01/on-webkit-security-updates/ for why it's a bad idea to be using WebKit1 almost three years after it was discontinued
Sep 20 16:55:28 <mcatanzaro>	DimStar, zaitor: It's either mutter or WebKit, I dunno which. Do you know if WebKitGTK+ 2.13.92 or 2.13.91 worked properly?
Sep 20 16:55:31 <DimStar>	note: there are also messages on CLI: Error sending IPC message: Broken pipe
Sep 20 16:55:38 <zaitor>	check out the "cool" area on overview - maybe that is a hint https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/OCacWaGm/Skjermdump%20fra%202016-09-20%2022-54-34.png
Sep 20 16:56:20 <zaitor>	also note how epip and evo is overlapping
Sep 20 16:56:26 <DimStar>	mcatanzaro: I'm pretty sure I did not see this with 2.13.92 (I was just going to rebuild .92 and retest.. just building webkit is not 'just' done)
Sep 20 16:57:01 <mcatanzaro>	zaitor: Good find. Let's start with mutter, it shouldn't be doing that even if WebKit is broken somehow. And DimStar thinks WebKit 2.13.92 was OK, and not much happened in WebKit since then.
Sep 20 16:57:17 <mcatanzaro>	CC me and cgarcia please
Sep 20 16:58:08 <DimStar>	mcatanzaro: at least webkit's NEWS has some interesting changes regarding wayland, like: Use gdk_cairo_draw_from_gl() when possible in Wayland to render
Sep 20 16:58:22 <zaitor>	ah yes, this is wayland only btw
Sep 20 16:58:28 <zaitor>	x11 is fine for the same
Sep 20 16:58:53 <mcatanzaro>	Changes in WebKit are here: http://trac.webkit.org/log/releases/WebKitGTK/webkit-2.14
Sep 20 16:59:31 *	zaitor looks at mcatanzaro: Not much happend...
Sep 20 16:59:54 <zaitor>	:-)
Sep 20 17:00:10 <mcatanzaro>	Well maybe r206045 or r206080 :)
Sep 20 17:00:31 <mcatanzaro>	That really is not much for a WebKit release :P
Sep 20 17:00:49 <zaitor>	hehe :-) active bunch you are /yoda mode off
Sep 20 17:02:26 <mcatanzaro>	Just make sure you have a bug on one Bugzilla or the other, cgarcia on CC, screenshots attached; someone smarter than me will need to sort it out!
Sep 20 17:03:15 <DimStar>	zaitor: can you file the bug? I'm just trying to rebuild .92; then we can at least conclusively say that this alone would or would not be the cause
Sep 20 17:08:23 <DimStar>	I still had some 2.13.91 binaries of webkitgtk around: with those, yelp and evo behave as expected
Sep 20 17:14:40 <mcatanzaro>	http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/206045 had to do with scaling factor
Sep 20 17:16:44 <DimStar>	https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162317 - we have a basic bug where we can start adding details as we find them

Sep 22 09:38:47 <annulen>	blino: I haven't investigated GstGL in Qt port yet, on my devices there's no use for it as STBs have hardware blending for video & UI layers, and on desktop it has okayish performance already
Sep 22 09:39:48 <blino>	ok
Sep 22 09:44:51 <blino>	KaL: for WebKitForWayland, I still think it would be useful to have both gst-gl path and HOLE_PUNCH_GSTREAMER path at the same time, but maybe it's specific to WPE
Sep 22 09:45:53 <KaL>	yes, as long as we don't have punch hole upstream it's specific to wpe
Sep 22 09:48:46 *	annulen wonders about https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157314 progress
Sep 22 09:56:33 <blino>	annulen: it is being done in WebKitForWayland
Sep 22 09:57:51 <annulen>	I'd preffered to get such things from trunk, but I'll check there, thanks
Sep 22 09:59:20 <philn>	annulen: it will land in trunk "soon"
Sep 22 09:59:27 <blino>	:)
Sep 22 10:00:12 <blino>	what is the most advanced branch now regarding MSE? wpe-media in WebKitForWayland repo or wpe-staging in the Metrological one? or are they similar now wrt MSE?
Sep 22 10:00:21 <annulen>	well, eocanha told me that it was already working in May :)
Sep 22 10:00:47 <philn>	blino: i'm lost in the branches, zdobersek should know
Sep 22 10:02:33 <zdobersek>	they should be identical in terms of behavior
Sep 22 10:03:20 *	blino is waiting for the next big bang in Metrological repo, when you will update to a newer WebKit snapshot
Sep 22 10:03:32 <zdobersek>	https://github.com/eocanha/webkit/tree/mse-backport-rebased-20160916 is going upstream
Sep 22 10:03:52 <blino>	I think there will be no hope anymore for the C++14 revert hacks at next WebKit rebase
Sep 22 10:04:50 <mcatanzaro>	Yeah good luck with that, you guys haven't upgraded to GCC 4.9 yet? I'm intent on continuing to support 4.9 but the 4.8 ship sailed long ago
Sep 22 10:06:12 <philn>	mcatanzaro: some antique MIPS-based hardware product still uses it
Sep 22 10:06:44 <annulen>	AFAIK broadcom provides only 4.8
Sep 22 10:06:49 <blino>	yep
Sep 22 10:06:50 <annulen>	need to build my own toolchain
Sep 22 10:07:08 <blino>	we are actually waiting for the chipset vendor to provide an "official toolchain" updated to >= 4.8, to get "official support"
Sep 22 10:07:25 <blino>	philn: ARM-based as well
Sep 22 10:07:37 <annulen>	same here but probably hopeless
Sep 22 10:07:44 <blino>	it's roughly the same BSP for MIPS and ARM at Broadcom
Sep 22 10:08:07 <annulen>	and codesourcery toolchain requires mips32r2 minimum
Sep 22 10:08:16 <blino>	annulen: I did a try with crosstool-NG, maybe it's what we'll use in the end for ARM
Sep 22 10:08:30 <blino>	with gcc >= 5.0
Sep 22 10:08:45 <blino>	a crosstool-NG with clang would be good as well, not sure if it is being worked on
Sep 22 10:09:16 <annulen>	I'm afraid it will miscompile kernel or broadcom's code
Sep 22 10:09:28 <blino>	I think we would use that only for WebKit
Sep 22 10:09:54 <annulen>	I also doubt it will optimize better
Sep 22 10:13:02 <annulen>	using clang with libstdc++ 4.8 won't work as it lacks needed c++14 library features
Sep 22 10:18:31 <blino>	yep, it would require libc++
Sep 22 11:47:45 <blino>	danw: hi, any hope to get the tls split branch merged in libsoup? it would be great to have the grounds for an openssl backend
Sep 22 11:48:37 <danw>	you mean glib-networking, not libsoup... um, yeah, i need to deal with that
Sep 22 11:50:53 <mcatanzaro>	danw: hi, any hope you'll find time to review kekun's HSTS patch? (I'll probably wind up trying to update and land it sooner or later.)
Sep 22 11:51:07 <mcatanzaro>	That's actually libsoup!
Sep 22 11:51:58 <danw>	mcatanzaro: my primary goal for libsoup and glib-networking for the next release cycle is to find new maintainers for them
Sep 22 11:52:29 <danw>	(this was also my primary goal for the *last* release cycle, i was just really lame about it...)
Sep 22 11:52:38 <mcatanzaro>	OK
Sep 22 12:11:02 <blino>	danw: yes, sorry, I meant glib-networking
Sep 22 12:12:01 <blino>	danw: my final goal is to be able to use hardware-specific openssl engines in WebKitForWayland
Sep 22 12:39:48 <blino>	KaL: I think I'll have a follow-up patch to handle the flipY case in copyVideoTextureToPlatformTexture()
Sep 23 09:36:05 <blino>	zdobersek: it seems that when we stop WPE with C-c (SIGINT) from a terminal, SIGINT is received by all the process group (UIProcess, WebProcess, NetworkProcess), and that there is no proper termination handling in WebProcess, thus our MediaPlayerPrivate and our gstreamer elements are not cleaned up properly, which exposes driver issues
Sep 23 09:36:16 <blino>	is this supposed to be terminated properly with SIGINT?
Sep 23 09:47:02 <zdobersek>	blino: SIGINT propagates to children, and that's probably fine
Sep 23 09:47:29 <zdobersek>	blino: the proper approach would be to handle SIGINT in the UIProcess and terminate that process cleanly
Sep 23 09:50:28 <blino>	but SIGINT will still propagate to children first, no?
Sep 23 09:59:11 <zdobersek>	yeah, that's the case
Sep 23 10:00:49 <blino>	so even if we handle SIGINT properly in the UIProcess to terminate children cleanly, they will likely be already gone because of SIGINT
Sep 23 10:01:26 <annulen>	handle SIGINT in WebProcess
Sep 23 10:03:53 <blino>	yes, we can do that
Sep 23 10:11:20 <zdobersek>	yeah, that seems most appropriate
Sep 23 10:11:38 <zdobersek>	in WebProcessMain::platformInitialize(), before anything starts
Sep 23 10:13:28 <blino>	using g_unix_signal_source_new() ?
Sep 23 10:14:47 <zdobersek>	that may be an overkill
Sep 23 10:15:10 <zdobersek>	it should be fine to just define the handler via g_unix_signal_add()
Sep 23 10:15:32 <zdobersek>	as long as the intent is to just suppress the signal
Sep 23 10:16:24 <zdobersek>	and it should be fine not to manage the lifetime of the source since it's a single source that's meant for the lifetime of the process
Sep 23 12:04:58 <blino>	KaL: I've added support for flipY (used by THREE.js) in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162491
Sep 23 15:44:18 <rave>	does anybody knows if webkitgtk suports vsync ?
Sep 23 15:44:23 <rave>	for Webgl Animations
Sep 23 16:14:28 <rave>	anybody >?

Sep 27 09:25:50 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: tpopela: KaL: kov: annulen: Sorry for disappearing yesterday! It kept freezing my system with very high I/O, and it was already quite late so I gave up and went away.
Sep 27 09:25:53 <rishi>	Let me try now.
Sep 27 09:26:47 <tpopela>	rishi, we think that we have now fixes for all issues..
Sep 27 09:44:05 <rishi>	tpopela: kov: It works fine with WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1.
Sep 27 09:44:21 <rishi>	Ok. Let me know if you want me to test anything.
Sep 27 09:48:12 <kov>	rishi, can you test with a previous version of webkitgtk4 maybe?
Sep 27 09:49:35 <rishi>	kov: I was using webkitgtk4-2.12.5 on this F23 machine without any problems before.
Sep 27 09:52:34 <mcatanzaro>	Ideally we would have a test package with carlos's recent xsync fix
Sep 27 09:54:03 <kov>	mcatanzaro, which one is that?
Sep 27 10:04:56 <mcatanzaro>	kov: http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/206305
Sep 27 10:05:28 <mcatanzaro>	You suggested that might be to blame for rishi's issue, right? I am not sure why....
Sep 27 10:05:53 <kov>	I didn't, I didn't know about that issue, probably someone else
Sep 27 10:06:14 <kov>	mcatanzaro, so rishi is on X, right?
Sep 27 10:06:23 <mcatanzaro>	Um I dunno, rishi?
Sep 27 10:06:28 <mcatanzaro>	I guess so, it's F23
Sep 27 10:06:30 <rishi>	Yes, X.
Sep 27 10:06:48 <rishi>	mcatanzaro: tpopela suggested it.
Sep 27 10:06:49 <kov>	that fix is for X, anyway =)
Sep 27 10:06:51 <rishi>	<tpopela> rishi, mcatanzaro that X error should be the one fixed by KaL
Sep 27 10:08:29 <kov>	\o/ let's see if it works

Sep 28 11:22:58 <danw>	KaL: (sorry, didn't notice your response earlier). i was being unclear. I meant, I think that if you don't skip to the end of the input stream before closing it, then libsoup won't read in the response body, and so as a result, it will have to close the HTTP connection rather than being able to reuse it
Sep 28 11:24:17 <KaL>	danw: np, ah, I see
Sep 28 11:25:16 <KaL>	danw: I wonder if we can skip synchronously now in the network process
Sep 28 11:26:03 <danw>	in any sane case you'd be able to, but it's theoretically possible for the response to have a very large body

Sep 28 15:31:36 <L1pe>	hi guys
Sep 28 15:31:55 <L1pe>	I have a question about touch events for webkit 2 > 2.10
Sep 28 15:32:28 <L1pe>	How can I disable the "scroll behavior" when dragging on a touchscreen?
Sep 28 16:25:25 <L1pe>	I never get the touchend event :(
Sep 29 06:13:47 <mcatanzaro>	KaL, zdobersek: A couple more patches left in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142074
Sep 29 06:35:15 <annulen>	mcatanzaro: what do you think about port-independent collection of UA hooks? at least as a kind of "hall of shame" for website makers
Sep 29 06:35:38 <annulen>	not necessary as a code, maybe just wiki page
Sep 29 06:35:47 <mcatanzaro>	annulen: Actually somebody else asked me to make UserAgentGtk port-independent yesterday
Sep 29 06:36:09 <mcatanzaro>	The plan is to rename it to UserAgent.cpp since there's not actually anything GTK-specific in there
Sep 29 06:36:25 <mcatanzaro>	But I have three remaining patches that KaL or zdobersek need to r+ before I will move the file ;)
Sep 29 06:36:30 <annulen>	cool
Sep 29 06:36:36 <mcatanzaro>	Then different ports can use it or not as they please
Sep 29 09:25:33 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, Hi Michael.. So the build is caused because I accidentally removed that define that in mentioned on the end of https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72099#c26 .. But the thing is that like KaL I'm not sure why it is there at all.. Isn't that sendContextMenuEventForKey() is missing WEBKIT_EXPORT? So the linker can't find it? But it is probably missing it on purpose as they don't want to expose it, thus there's need to be a
Sep 29 09:25:33 <tpopela>	COCOA guard..
Sep 29 09:26:10 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: If you need it in WebKit2 then you can add WEBCORE_EXPORT
Sep 29 09:28:03 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, but the reason is whether we want to..
Sep 29 09:28:30 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, are they applying some filters later as what to expose outside the shared library?
Sep 29 09:29:11 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: I presume so. You can definitely use whatever WebCore symbols you need.
Sep 29 09:29:42 <tpopela>	ok I will export it..
Sep 29 09:41:18 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, btw you didn't have any objections about centering the context menu yesterday ;)
Sep 29 09:43:04 <tpopela>	mcatanzaro, btw do you know what's this? https://git.gnome.org/browse/webkitgtk-tarball-releases/
Sep 29 11:11:21 <mcatanzaro>	tpopela: I did, but you were very focused on KaL's monitor :P
Sep 29 11:11:45 <mcatanzaro>	I don't know what that is, certainly it's obsolete.
Sep 29 11:13:43 <annulen>	I guess it's lightweight repo for those who don't want to clone whole webkit, I maintain similar for qtwebkit (though it has more snapshots than just releases)
Sep 30 11:24:03 <msanchez>	kov, philn: around?
Sep 30 11:26:41 <msanchez>	or yoon, whoever understands how the GStreamerGL stuff works, really :)
Sep 30 11:27:02 <msanchez>	My question is how this is supposed to work:  m_glDisplay = GST_GL_DISPLAY(gst_gl_display_egl_new_with_egl_display(downcast<PlatformDisplayWayland>(sharedDisplay).native())); (in https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/master/Source/WebCore/platform/graphics/gstreamer/MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase.cpp#L271)
Sep 30 11:27:11 <msanchez>	 
Sep 30 11:27:59 <msanchez>	gst_gl_display_egl_new_with_egl_display() expects an EGLDisplay (yes, even if the doc says something about an X11 display), but that .native() call returns an wl_display*. Am I missing something?
Sep 30 11:28:29 <msanchez>	Turns out that I make a similar mistake for the X11 path the other day (reason for bug 162669), that's why I noticed
Sep 30 11:28:31 <msanchez>	any idea?
Sep 30 13:02:23 <msanchez>	In case anyone is interested, I published some comments on cross-building for ARM, based on what I did during the web engines hackfest:
Sep 30 13:02:24 <msanchez>	https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/BuildingGtk#CrossCompilingforARMdevices
Sep 30 13:04:29 <annulen>	msanchez: CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON is excessive as anyone can use make VERBOSE=1
Sep 30 13:04:35 <annulen>	when needed
Sep 30 13:05:24 <msanchez>	Probably, this is what I used for myself, but it's probably too much. I'll remove it
Sep 30 13:05:53 <msanchez>	ha, turns out I remove it from the README.md in the repo already
Sep 30 13:14:41 <annulen>	msanchez: -O0 for development, srsly? you must have fast hardware
Sep 30 13:15:07 <annulen>	I prefer O2 for debug instead
Sep 30 13:17:27 <msanchez>	annulen: yes, it's fast hardware, and when I build for ARM I normally want to be able to debug later, that's why I put that
Sep 30 13:17:59 <msanchez>	granted, this is just a recipe coming out of my particular personal use, but as I haven't found anything like this I thought I'd better share what I have. People can adapt
Sep 30 13:18:30 <msanchez>	I'm happy to put -O2 or even -O3 for the release flags though, for the more general case
Sep 30 13:22:23 <msanchez>	annulen: fixed, thanks
Sep 30 13:22:50 <msanchez>	you can pass CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG anyway
Sep 30 13:24:31 <msanchez>	if you try it, please let me know. It definitely worked and saved me a ton of time but I'm sure it's not perfect :)
Sep 30 13:57:13 <msanchez>	off for the weekend, cheers
