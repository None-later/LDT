May 04 11:09:44 <pingou>	vondruch: can you reproduce in stg.pagure.io?
May 04 11:10:13 <vondruch>	pingou: hmmm, there are no issues, are there? :)
May 04 11:10:22 <pingou>	should be some
May 04 11:11:26 <vondruch>	pingou: may be PRs
May 04 11:11:27 <pingou>	vondruch: https://stg.pagure.io/freeipa-test2/issues
May 04 11:12:13 <vondruch>	pingou: ah, staging ... sorry, I was confused
May 04 11:12:14 <pingou>	(this one is taking longer for me 16 secs and counting)
May 04 11:12:29 <pingou>	~40 seconds totla
May 04 11:13:04 <vondruch>	pingou: that is smooth for me ;)
May 04 11:13:21 <vondruch>	pingou: just 2 seconds at max
May 04 11:26:52 <sharkcz>	pjones: hi, please look at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1574868 - we have broken composes on non-efi arches right now
May 04 11:28:06 <pjones>	hey sweet, how'd I manage that
May 04 11:28:21 <tyll>	zbyszek: these are the long-time FTBFS packages: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/eIPZx2sLv9sqAF5FdJvG-Q
May 04 11:28:25 <pingou>	vondruch: using ipv4 or ipv6?
May 04 11:28:26 <pjones>	oh, okay
May 04 11:28:38 <pjones>	sharkcz: thanks for getting my attention, should be easy to fix, and I'll do so right after lunch
May 04 11:28:54 <sharkcz>	pjones: thx
May 04 11:31:15 <tmz>	pingou, vondruch: I see the same issue.  When logged in, loading the infra issues (or freeipa issues, as above), pagure takes a long time (well, it doesn't load in the several minutes I've let it spin on numerous tries).  In stg, that wasn't the case for freeipa-test2/issues.
May 04 11:47:37 <vondruch>	pingou: ipv4 .. assuming
May 04 11:48:33 <vondruch>	pingou: at least I'd say from the traceroute output
May 04 11:49:22 <vondruch>	tmz: glad I am not alone ;)
May 04 11:51:37 <tmz>	vondruch: And Michal Novotny (clime) said it affected him as well.  Hopefully that's enough to help find what's common and spot a fix. :)
May 04 12:06:19 <smooge>	vondruch, can you do an ip addr and see if you have an ipv6 address
May 04 12:06:48 <smooge>	I believe traceroute will only do ipv4 even if you have both ipv6 and ipv4
May 04 12:20:30 <tomhughes>	there is a separate traceroute6
May 04 12:21:08 <tomhughes>	or use mtr which has the normal -4 / -6 switches
May 04 12:28:26 <nirik>	tmz / vondruch: can you see if it is any better/different now?
May 04 12:31:25 <tmz>	nirik: Sure.  With the firefox dev console, it was taking a little over 10 minutes to load that page.  I reloaded it now.
May 04 12:31:56 <tmz>	And, FWIW, I don't have any ipv6 connectivity at the moment.
May 04 12:31:58 <nirik>	so it's not network time it's time until you get a responce back?
May 04 12:33:09 <tmz>	The firefox performance graph shows something like 619 seconds for the html portion.
May 04 12:33:40 <nirik>	wow. ok. The infra issues page loads here in 7 seconds.
May 04 12:34:04 <tmz>	For me, loading the page from a clean tab just leave the tab blank and the tab icon spinning.  I go and do other things and eventually it loads.
May 04 12:34:24 <nirik>	and it looks ok then? no missing images/js/avatars?
May 04 12:35:00 <tmz>	Yeah.  I'll look closer at the dev tool output and see if there's any 4XX or 5XX response codes, but I didn't notice any before.
May 04 12:35:25 <nirik>	weird. Also, for grins could you try a new profile?
May 04 12:37:12 <tmz>	Yeah, I was going to get to that.  I was actually just going to move ~/.mozilla aside and be completely clean.
May 04 12:42:07 <tmz>	that it's consistently just over 10 minutes makes me suspicious that there's some network timeouts.
May 04 12:42:36 <bowlofeggs>	nirik++
May 04 12:42:36 <zodbot>	bowlofeggs: Karma for kevin changed to 9 (for the f28 release cycle):  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/tags/cookie/any

May 04 12:42:56 <zodbot>	nirik: Karma for bowlofeggs changed to 7 (for the f28 release cycle):  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/tags/cookie/any
May 04 12:56:25 <tmz>	nirik: There does seem to be something boked up in my browser profile.  Moving ~/.mozilla aside entirely and starting fresh, the issues page loads quickly.
May 04 12:56:53 <nirik>	huh. but other folks are hitting it too, so it has to be something pretty common. ;(
May 04 12:57:00 <nirik>	what extensions do you use?
May 04 12:57:04 <tmz>	Time to poke around at what's wrong in my profile (or more likely take the opportunity to clean house)
May 04 13:03:44 <tmz>	nirik: I have: Cookie Controller, GNOME Shell Integration, It's All Text!, Tab Mix Plus, and uBlock Origin.
May 04 13:04:15 <tmz>	I disabled them all, without effect on the issue, so it doesn't seem like it's one of those.
May 04 13:05:22 <tmz>	I'm running Firefox ESR (built from a COPR which uses the fedora firefox-52.x, rather than the mozilla binary).
May 04 13:16:39 <nirik>	huh, ok.
May 04 13:54:24 <pjones>	sharkcz: hopefully https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=26769722 should fix things for you
May 04 13:54:46 <pjones>	sharkcz: it at least fixes the ExclusiveArch issue; hopefully it also evaluates without errors on the other arches.
May 04 13:56:42 <nirik>	hum... pjones:
May 04 13:56:44 <nirik>	Error: Transaction check error:
May 04 13:56:44 <nirik>	  file /boot/efi/EFI from install of efi-filesystem-2-5.fc29.noarch conflicts with file from package shim-x64-15-3.x86_64
May 04 13:57:01 <nirik>	perms on that stupid vfat volume again?
May 04 13:57:09 <pjones>	yeah, the problem with stopping working on the shim package to fix the thing it depends on...
May 04 13:57:20 *	pjones goes back to fixing that
May 04 13:57:33 <nirik>	happy to help test if you like
May 04 13:57:57 <pjones>	the very moment I figure out how to actually make the koji srpm building work like it looks like it should, I will let you know ;)
May 04 13:58:56 <nirik>	I'll not wait around... 🙂
May 04 14:07:32 <pjones>	nirik: hopefully https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=26769862 should solve that issue (though it's a temporary fix while I work on the other part)
May 04 14:08:10 <nirik>	ok
May 04 14:08:38 <pjones>	the intent here is to move all of the directory ownereship of that crap to efi-filesystem so the other packages won't conflict by virtue of not owning the directories
May 04 14:08:44 <pjones>	ownership even
May 04 14:09:47 <pjones>	though I expect somewhere around the 100 or 200th attempt Guinness is going to beat rpm.
May 04 14:10:16 <nirik>	pity that fs has to be vfat. ;(
May 04 14:10:25 <pjones>	ain't nothin' I can do about that.
May 04 14:10:27 <nirik>	and yes, I would put Guinness over rpm. ;)
May 04 14:23:01 <tmz>	nirik: So much for a clean firfox profile solving load times in pagure issues.  I've now gotten 3 consecutive 500 responses from https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issues, ranging from 48 seconds to 6+ minutes.
May 04 14:23:41 <nirik>	huh, ok. what version of firefox was this?
May 04 14:24:36 <tmz>	52.7.3
May 04 14:25:15 <tmz>	It's not all pagure project issues pages.  But fedora-infrastructure/issues tickles something.
May 04 14:26:04 <nirik>	I'm not sure how to further debug. ;( It's definitely a bug tho. Just started in the last day or two?
May 04 14:26:43 <tmz>	I only noticed it today.  I don't recall when I pulled up the issues page last, but sometime in the past few days I believe.
May 04 14:27:15 <nirik>	yeah, so likely tied to the pagure upgrade yesterday.
May 04 14:27:22 <tmz>	The 500 response codes should have some logs, so perhaps they'll help.
May 04 14:27:36 <nirik>	yeah
May 04 14:27:44 *	nirik has to head out for a bit. back in a bit
May 04 14:27:49 <tmz>	Enjoy.
May 04 14:31:18 <pjones>	I'll take "degenerate cases in .spec macro expansion" for $400, Alex: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/sl49dOJMeCfRkjbuiKJQMA
May 04 14:31:56 <pjones>	I like how it takes 60 attempts before it decides a->a transitions aren't going to work out.
May 04 14:43:33 <maxamillion>	puiterwijk: ping - I'm good with this if you are -> https://github.com/fedora-cloud/docker-brew-fedora/pull/56
May 04 14:43:45 <maxamillion>	I need to run, bbl
May 04 14:44:30 <puiterwijk>	maxamillion: in that case, I'd rather merge the one from Jim from... way longer ago: https://github.com/fedora-cloud/docker-brew-fedora/pull/34
May 04 14:45:00 <puiterwijk>	I was under the impression you didn't want anything like that because you didn't touch that one
May 04 14:45:17 <maxamillion>	puiterwijk: OMG, I forgot about that. I should have merged it forever ago. +1
May 04 14:46:15 <puiterwijk>	ack. Merged that.
May 04 14:46:23 <puiterwijk>	I'll rebuild the images somewhere next week I think
May 04 14:46:50 <maxamillion>	+1

May 07 15:10:17 <nirik>	vondruch: (and anyone else that was seeing very slow/infinite load times for pagure issues) can you try again now, the issue should be fixed hopefully.
May 07 15:15:13 <sandeen>	was gcc removed from the default buildroot for f28?  If I query f28 src.rpms for Requires: gcc can I be reasonabily confident that I won't miss any?
May 07 15:17:28 <misc>	to make it smaller and faster to install for package that do not requires gcc to build (like a lot of noarch))
May 07 15:17:35 <misc>	oups
May 07 15:17:40 <misc>	yes, I think gcc was removed
May 07 15:17:44 <sandeen>	k :)
May 07 15:17:46 <misc>	(didn't see there wasn't a why)
May 07 15:17:51 <sandeen>	no problem
May 07 15:18:06 <misc>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Remove_GCC_from_BuildRoot to confirm
May 07 15:18:13 <sandeen>	i'm scanning F28 src.rpms for code that uses the new clone/dedup etc filesystem ioctsl to see which packages are using this functionality (if any)
May 07 15:18:28 <ajax>	misc: note that page lists f29 as the target
May 07 15:18:30 <nirik>	there is a change...
May 07 15:18:32 <sandeen>	mmm
May 07 15:18:33 <nirik>	but it's not done
May 07 15:18:45 <sandeen>	so there may be src.rpms that contain C code but don't list gcc.
May 07 15:18:47 <sandeen>	crap.

May 08 11:52:11 <scx>	Could someone show me result of this command?: dnf provides '/usr/lib64/python*/*-packages/gi/*'
May 08 11:55:25 <ajax>	python3-gobject
May 08 11:57:39 <scx>	ajax: thanks
May 08 15:30:14 <pouar>	ping tibbs someone wants me to add brotli to the EPEL, but I'm not sure if I'm qualified to release for the EPEL
May 08 15:38:40 <tibbs>	Why wouldn't you be?
May 08 15:40:58 <pouar>	I tend to hold Centos/RHEL with higher standards that I'm not sure I can live up to
May 08 15:41:06 <tibbs>	Well that's up to you.
May 08 15:41:29 <pouar>	I forwarded you the email I received
May 08 15:41:30 <tibbs>	If you want to maintain the package there, request a branch and build it.
May 08 15:41:34 <tibbs>	If you don't then don't.
May 08 15:42:55 <tibbs>	Personally I dislike maintaining things in EPEL because I'm not sufficiently free to update the packages when needed and I don't want to be on the hook for backporting security fixes.  But that's just me.
May 08 15:43:24 <pouar>	Right now I consider RHEL to be in the same league as the commercial Unix systems such as Solaris and AIX
May 08 15:43:33 <tibbs>	If you're not interested, tell the person who made the request that you're not interested.  Nothing forces you to maintain it there.
May 08 15:43:38 <pouar>	and I'm not good at backporting fixes that far back either
May 08 15:44:03 <tibbs>	Man, AIX?  That's bordering on insulting to the RHEL folks.
May 08 15:44:37 <tibbs>	But I use Fedora almost everywhere because getting bugs fixed in RHEL is too difficult.  The procedure is just too ossified.
May 08 15:44:42 <pouar>	I'm talking in realms of stability and reliablity
May 08 15:44:51 <tibbs>	Exactly.
May 08 15:45:39 <pouar>	frankly I think Linux is easier to maintian, but a lot of Linux systems aren't exactly as stable as the commerical Unix systems
May 08 15:45:43 <tibbs>	As in, not really as stable or reliable as their marketing would have you believe.  But it's expensive and the companies are big, so people assume that they must be super great.  And yeah, I have used all of those products.
May 08 15:45:49 <drakonis>	hmm
May 08 15:46:03 <tibbs>	But hey, feel free to maintain your package in EPEL, or not.  It's completely up to you.
May 08 15:46:08 <drakonis>	pouar, linux isn't beheld to the OS vendor's clownshoes way to do things
May 08 15:46:19 <pouar>	although Solaris and AIX hasn't kept up with Linux in terms of functionality and ease of use
May 08 15:46:49 <pouar>	haven't used AIX, but I've used Solaris, and Solaris used to be good
May 08 15:46:55 <pouar>	until Oracle got a hold of it
May 08 15:47:36 <drakonis>	its the main advantage over proprietary unixes
May 08 15:47:46 <pouar>	anyway, I think RHEL can replace AIX and Solaris systems pretty easily without much worry
May 08 15:50:22 <tibbs>	I ran AIX starting with its first incarnation on an IBM RT, and Solaris since, well, Solaris 1 which doesn't really count as Solaris.  All I can say is that I'm really glad Linux exists.
May 08 15:50:34 <pouar>	true
May 08 15:51:39 <pouar>	proprietary Unix systems haven't seem to have kept up with Linux or the BSDs
May 08 15:52:10 <pouar>	especially UnixWare
May 08 15:53:13 <pouar>	one of the worst Unix systems I've ever tried. It's like they stopped developing it and just started charging rent.
May 08 15:53:24 <tomhughes>	ha ha ha
May 08 15:53:39 <tomhughes>	actual Unixware or OpenWhateverItIsThisWeek
May 08 15:53:54 <ajax>	openserver 10 is i can't believe it's not freebsd, iirc.
May 08 15:54:06 <pouar>	was about to say that
May 08 15:54:09 <tomhughes>	oh I didn't know there was a 10!
May 08 15:54:17 <pouar>	OpenServer 10 isn't all that interesting
May 08 15:54:18 <ajax>	tomhughes: you and everbody else!
May 08 15:54:28 <tomhughes>	after 2 => 7 => 8 => 6 I'd expect anything though
May 08 15:54:32 <pouar>	just use FreeBSD
May 08 15:55:08 <drakonis>	ha, freebsd?
May 08 15:55:15 <drakonis>	they can barely compete with linux
May 08 15:56:23 <smooge>	pouar, my personal view is that is putting EPEL at a little too high regard. People use CentOS and RHEL for lots of different reasons which need software which isn't 'solid'.. if it is solid then Red Hat can support it. If it isn't.. then just do what you can.. but if people need more than that.. you charge $400.00/hour
May 08 15:57:02 <tomhughes>	we did drop unxiware/openserver in our most recent release at work and so far it seems to have stuck though I know there are still a few holdouts in our userbase...
May 08 15:57:21 <tomhughes>	they're gradually moving to linux though
May 08 15:58:38 <pouar>	I actually like FreeBSD, though I prefer Linux
May 08 15:59:12 <pouar>	FreeBSD would probably be my second choice if something ever happened to Linux
May 08 15:59:30 <pouar>	which probably isn't going to happen
May 08 15:59:34 <drakonis>	unlikely
May 08 16:00:32 <pouar>	wish the FreeBSD devs would upgrade their GNU code in their base system
May 08 16:00:57 <pouar>	sticking with ancient software just because they don't like the GPLv3 seems kinda dumb
May 08 16:01:02 <drakonis>	they're trying to purge it lol
May 08 16:01:15 <drakonis>	they're using that as a selling point
May 08 16:01:18 <pouar>	and replace it with inferior alternatives
May 08 16:01:19 <drakonis>	https://wiki.freebsd.org/GPLinBase
May 08 16:01:53 <pouar>	I saw their "BSD Elf Toolchain" and it just looked like they were rewriting GNU.
May 08 16:02:34 <pouar>	they didn't add anything useful to it
May 08 16:02:50 <pouar>	their only argument is that it's BSD licensed
May 08 16:03:14 <sub_pop>	Which matters to corporations scared of copyleft licenses
May 08 16:03:15 <drakonis>	lol
May 08 16:03:23 <drakonis>	that doesn't stick anymore
May 08 16:03:44 <drakonis>	would've been an argument against linux if it was in the early 2000s
May 08 16:04:04 <pouar>	to me, it does not matter whether something is BSD or GPL licensed. FOSS is FOSS.
May 08 16:04:33 <sub_pop>	Ask TiVo what they think of BSD vs GPL. They'll probably give you a different opinion.
May 08 16:04:50 <drakonis>	oh no
May 08 16:05:01 <drakonis>	its one of those people that care too much
May 08 16:05:05 <pouar>	that's the only argument that they gave, and that's a good reason to use the GPL
May 08 16:06:06 <drakonis>	the thing is though
May 08 16:06:20 <drakonis>	for practical reasons, linux is still vastly superior
May 08 16:06:26 <wadadli>	is it fine to install docker from our repos or should I use docker's?
May 08 16:06:48 <sub_pop>	Personally, I like what the GPL does to software; I'm just saying, corporations will be drawn to the more permissive licenses because it's less risky for them.
May 08 16:07:18 <drakonis>	sometimes the BSD license is useful for adoption
May 08 16:07:30 <drakonis>	permissive licenses in this case
May 08 16:07:35 <drakonis>	kubernetes
May 08 16:10:27 <drakonis>	fyi, gplv3 is worse than gplv2 for companies
May 08 16:11:34 <pouar>	good
May 08 16:15:02 <drakonis>	the horrible irony of freebsd switching their userland to bsd licensed alternatives is that they're almost all worse than the previous options
May 08 16:15:43 <gholms>	That's a tradeoff that they're willing to make
May 08 16:15:46 <drakonis>	bar using llvm as the compiler toolchain, which in this case, instead of being worse, it is just broken
May 08 16:15:49 <drakonis>	in various ways
May 08 16:16:25 <drakonis>	lld and lldb aren't really fully functional because they don't interact with upstream very often
May 08 16:18:00 <drakonis>	also they're worse because "gotta stick to posix/make it as unixy as possible"
May 08 16:20:00 <drakonis>	weird choices
May 08 16:44:48 <tstellar_>	drakonis: How is the llvm toolchain broken?
May 08 16:45:03 <drakonis>	i mean in freebsd's case
May 08 16:45:38 <drakonis>	they have it up to date, but as time goes, it becomes less usable there
May 08 16:46:28 <drakonis>	freebsd lldb doesn't use the new API, the old one will be deprecated soon
May 08 16:46:43 <drakonis>	lld doesn't work
May 08 16:47:16 <drakonis>	i suppose it was too much fire and forget for them
May 08 17:00:19 <TC01>	I have a couple of F27 updates on which the automatic test gating appears to have gone wrong, with:
May 08 17:00:21 <TC01>	"Command &#39;clamscan&#39; not found in /usr/bin, /bin at /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl/RPM/Grill/Plugin/VirusCheck.pm line 73.\n"
May 08 17:00:33 <TC01>	(this update, for instance: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-bd73ec6f3a )
May 08 17:00:43 <tomhughes>	they all say that
May 08 17:01:28 <TC01>	well, the "Test Gating Status" on the update says "1 of 2 required tests not found", and there is no "Push to Batched" option on the update even though it claims to have been in testing for 7 days
May 08 17:01:36 <TC01>	I was assuming these things were related. Perhaps they are not?
May 08 17:02:01 <TC01>	I was going to ask what the simplest way to override this was.
May 08 17:02:33 <bowlofeggs>	TC01: technically i think it needs 3 more hours before it can be pushed, but yes you should waive the missing test
May 08 17:03:00 <bowlofeggs>	TC01: to waive it, https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_update_HOWTO#Waive_the_absence_of_a_result
May 08 17:03:24 <TC01>	Do I need to use this waiverdb-cli thing to do that?
May 08 17:03:26 <TC01>	ah
May 08 17:03:38 <bowlofeggs>	TC01: i'm working on a bodhi release that will make it possible to waive this via the bodhi GUI, but it won't be deployed until tomorrow at the earliest
May 08 17:03:45 <bowlofeggs>	TC01: yeah, the CLI
May 08 17:04:16 <bowlofeggs>	TC01: the bodhi release i'm working on actually isn't nice for this at all, in fact, it's kind of awful, but waiverdb-cli is more awful, so… progress?
May 08 17:04:44 <TC01>	I mean, I'd much rather use a web interface for this than a command line interface, so... progress :)
May 08 17:05:16 <TC01>	Thanks for the information. I'll try to do that in a few hours once the update is nominally push-able
May 08 18:05:40 <bowlofeggs>	TC01: hahah yeah understood - look out for an e-mail from me to devel/announce soon - i'll explain what is awful about the bodhi ui for this and why it's still better than the cli :)

May 09 11:11:17 <ignatenkobrain>	sgallagh: what's the point of calling branch 1.20 for libuv? given that 1.x doesn't break ABI
May 09 11:12:47 <sgallagh>	ignatenkobrain: Didn't it? I know minor releases have broken ABI before
May 09 11:13:04 <sgallagh>	I think I remember  1.16 ->1.17 being particularly bad
May 09 11:13:31 <sgallagh>	I suppose upstream might have wised up since then
May 09 11:14:00 <ignatenkobrain>	https://abi-laboratory.pro/tracker/timeline/libuv/
May 09 11:14:10 <ignatenkobrain>	Versioning. Starting with version 1.0.0 libuv follows the semantic versioning scheme. The API change and backwards compatibility rules are those indicated by SemVer. libuv will keep a stable ABI across major releases. The ABI/API changes can be tracked here.
May 09 11:14:20 <ignatenkobrain>	on their github page
May 09 11:14:29 <sgallagh>	ok
May 09 11:14:56 <sgallagh>	Then we can probably scrap it in favor of a "1" branch
May 09 11:15:22 <sgallagh>	That branch isn't exposed outside of dist-git anywhere, though
May 09 11:15:22 <ignatenkobrain>	sgallagh: yeah
May 09 11:15:25 <sgallagh>	We have no module stream for it.
May 09 11:15:30 <ignatenkobrain>	I think this would be the best
May 09 11:15:44 <sgallagh>	It's mostly there because I found it convenient for Node 10
May 09 11:16:02 <ignatenkobrain>	but you would probably need to ask releng to remove that branch
May 09 11:16:09 <ignatenkobrain>	since commits from that branch are 1:1 with master, they should be fine with removal of branch
May 09 11:16:14 <sgallagh>	It doesn't need to be removed, just ignored.
May 09 11:16:27 <sgallagh>	It doesn't hurt anything to be there
May 09 11:18:19 *	ignatenkobrain dislikes having hundreds of unneeded branches... but up2you ;)
May 09 11:34:03 <radez>	eclipseo: ping, I believe you did a review of ansible-runner for me? I made some updates, would you be able to do another review for me? https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1575142
May 09 11:37:33 <timothy>	hi, is there any way to use fedpkg with yum_cache_enable = True. it seems koji disables it (/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/koji/__init__.py)?
May 09 11:46:26 <eclipseo>	pong radez I added it to my todo list

May 09 11:59:27 <radez>	eclipseo: I've been trying to get them to updated their tarball :/ I rolled the tarball I pushed up there from the gitrepo
May 09 12:00:18 <radez>	I'll push on the ansible guys to get it updated and let you know when I get them to update it. Is that all that seems missing at this point?
May 09 12:00:55 <eclipseo>	you can grab the tarball from their Gitrepo instead of Pythonhosted
May 09 12:01:13 <eclipseo>	until they update it I guess
May 09 12:01:32 <radez>	oh yea, good thought. I'll do that
May 09 12:06:44 <radez>	eclipseo: is it ok to leave the old repo link in the spec with a comment like this:

May 09 12:07:42 <eclipseo>	Sure but comment out the variable by doubling the %
May 09 12:08:23 <radez>	cool, will do
May 09 12:21:20 <pouar>	ping tibbs the person is willing to help maintain brotli for EPEL, should he become a comaintainer?
May 09 12:21:37 <tibbs>	That's up to you.
May 09 12:24:03 <pouar>	I'm willing for him to become a comaintainer, but I'm not sure how to add him as one, or if I even have that kind of access to do so.
May 09 12:24:17 <tibbs>	If the person is already a packager and you want them to help, just add them as a committer or admin in the pagure repository for your package.
May 09 12:30:09 <radez>	eclipseo: updated the spec and rebuilt, I also noticed that python3 support was failing to test. I'm not sure the ansible-rnuner folks have looked at py3 support yet so I pulled out the python3 package until I can be in touch with them about it
May 09 12:35:39 <eclipseo>	radez: will finish the view in 1h30

May 10 10:20:25 <mlichvar>	sgallagh: thank you
May 10 10:22:39 <sgallagh>	mlichvar: Just F27 and 28, right? Not rawhide?
May 10 10:24:09 <sgallagh>	mlichvar: is there a BZ I can reference in the changelog?
May 10 10:25:23 <mlichvar>	sgallagh: #1573961
May 10 10:25:34 <sgallagh>	Thanks
May 10 10:25:47 <mlichvar>	rawhide can wait for new upstream release
May 10 10:28:10 <ajax>	sharkcz: hah, i was just thinking about that when i woke up.
May 10 10:28:40 <ajax>	sharkcz: i'll send it to the list. pixman is sort of unmaintained atm so this is a good opportunity to revive it anyway.
May 10 10:28:59 <sharkcz>	ajax: ok, thx
May 10 10:38:41 <sgallagh>	mlichvar: https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/tasks?view=toplevel&owner=sgallagh&state=active&method=all&order=-id
May 10 10:39:05 <sgallagh>	Actually, https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/tasks?state=all&owner=sgallagh&view=toplevel&method=all&order=-id is better
May 10 10:40:26 <sgallagh>	mlichvar: When those finish, can you send out an email to each of the owners and ask them to create an update? I don't want to step on anyone's toes; some of those are very important packages
May 10 10:41:17 <mlichvar>	sgallagh: wouldn't it be better to group them to one update with libidn?
May 10 10:41:34 <sgallagh>	mlichvar: Maybe
May 10 10:41:35 <mlichvar>	so they are updated at the same time
May 10 10:41:43 <sgallagh>	Let me check to see if any of them already have updates in-flifht
May 10 10:41:45 <sgallagh>	*flight
May 10 10:42:35 <sgallagh>	Looks like they don't, so maybe you're right
May 10 11:17:38 <mlichvar>	sgallagh: I tried to add the packages to https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-aae2d44488/edit and https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-25d5c86330, but failed due to missing commit access
May 10 11:17:40 <sgallagh>	mlichvar: Did you want me to replace your libdn update with these?
May 10 11:17:52 <mlichvar>	sgallagh: yes :)
May 10 11:17:54 <sgallagh>	ok
May 10 11:20:40 <mlichvar>	I'll send an email to the owners
May 10 11:20:52 <sgallagh>	mlichvar: done
May 10 11:21:14 <mlichvar>	sgallagh: thanks
May 10 11:21:40 <sgallagh>	Happy to help

May 10 11:32:12 <fedbot>	FPC meeting in 30 minutes in #fedora-meeting-1
May 10 11:43:59 <ajax>	crobinso: hey, is there some magic missing from virt-manager to get virgl working in the guest?
May 10 11:45:49 <crobinso>	ajax: the default VM config doesn't support it out of the box. so you need to switch the video model to virtio, click 3d accel on the video model, and click gl on the spice graphics page
May 10 11:46:43 <crobinso>	ajax: or use the virt-xml snippets here: http://blog.wikichoon.com/2016/05/spice-openglvirgl-acceleration-on.html
May 10 11:46:59 <eclipseo>	@f26eol
May 10 11:46:59 <fedbot>	Fedora 26 will go end of life and no longer supporterd one month after fedora 28 is released (sometime around may 2018), so around june 2018
May 10 11:47:22 <ajax>	crobinso: huh. i'd have thought clicking '3d accel' in the virtio tab would have been enough.
May 10 11:47:58 <crobinso>	ajax: yeah it's not very friendly in the UI...
May 10 11:48:30 <crobinso>	ajax: I think it also needs Listen: None in the graphics page
May 10 11:50:03 <ajax>	heeeey, there we go.
May 10 11:50:40 <ajax>	crobinso: thanks!
May 10 11:50:51 <crobinso>	ajax: np
May 10 11:54:28 <fedbot>	FPC meeting in 5 minutes in #fedora-meeting-1
May 10 11:57:56 <sgallagh>	crobinso, ajax: When I attempt it, I just get a black screen when the VM boots. No output at all
May 10 11:58:11 <sgallagh>	Known not to work with nouveau?
May 10 11:58:17 <ajax>	that's what i'd have assumed from Listen: none
May 10 11:58:37 <ajax>	and is what i get here on both amdgpu and intel
May 10 12:00:11 <crobinso>	ajax: sgallagh: I haven't heard of any hardware specific issues recently... could just be plain broken, I didn't test with f28. there's quite a few moving parts
May 10 12:00:25 <sgallagh>	When I don't use Listen: none, I just get "Unable to complete install: 'internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: 2018-05-10T15:59:57.394586Z qemu-system-x86_64: SPICE GL support is local-only for now and incompatible with -spice port/tls-port'"
May 10 12:00:45 <fedbot>	FPC meeting starting now in #fedora-meeting-1
May 10 12:00:58 <ajax>	wondering why it doesn't just do -display egl-headless
May 10 12:01:48 <ajax>	in unrelated news why is gpg1 still legal
May 10 12:04:00 <sgallagh>	ajax: 'murica ?
May 10 12:05:22 <tmz>	ignatenkobrain said he has plans to introduce a change for f29 to make gpg gpg2 by default.
May 10 12:06:11 <crobinso>	ajax: didn't know about egl-headless, libvirt doesn't support it yet though so that would be the first step
May 10 12:06:24 <tmz>	Upstream hasn't done much with the tickets to make gpg-1.4.x install as gpg1 by default, which would make it clearer to everyone that it should be happening.
May 10 12:06:35 <crobinso>	ajax: listen=none is basically 'only allow direct fd connection' which was the only way this originally worked
May 10 12:07:46 <ajax>	nod
May 10 12:09:56 <ajax>	would also be cool if gvt worked, but i'm several steps away from intel working on this machine anyway
May 10 12:48:25 <kparal>	jcline: hi, are you the same person as clime on pagure?
May 10 12:48:48 <jcline>	kparal, nope, I'm jcline most places
May 10 12:49:10 <jcline>	clime is usually clime on irc
May 10 12:57:29 <kparal>	ok, thanks
May 10 22:24:12 <QuLogic>	bowlofeggs++ thanks
May 10 22:24:13 <zodbot>	QuLogic: Karma for bowlofeggs changed to 9 (for the f28 release cycle):  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/tags/cookie/any
May 11 05:11:36 <Dejan>	is dl.fedora down?
May 11 05:13:05 <Dejan>	ah no, looks like it is just little bit slow today
May 11 08:30:14 <zbyszek>	sgallagh: fesco agenda?
May 11 08:30:24 <sgallagh>	eep, I'm running it today aren't I?
May 11 08:30:31 <zbyszek>	yeah
May 11 08:30:33 <sgallagh>	I'll get it out as soon as I exit this meeting.
May 11 08:30:36 <sgallagh>	Thanks for the reminder.
May 11 08:31:01 <sgallagh>	(Weird; I set myself a calendar appointment to send the agenda yesterday and then didn't get the notification...)
May 11 09:54:39 <radez>	Hey folks, I built a package a couple days ago against my master branch but it didn't land in the development repo. Is there something I'm missing to make it land in rawhide?
May 11 09:55:24 <radez>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=26961
May 11 10:30:18 <zbyszek>	Error: Transaction check error: file /usr/sbin/pidof conflicts between attempted installs of procps-ng-3.3.14-1.fc29.x86_64 and procps-ng-3.3.14-1.fc29.x86_64
May 11 10:30:29 <zbyszek>	dnf, what do you mean?!
May 11 10:30:57 <ignatenkobrain>	zbyszek: ask RPM
May 11 10:31:01 <ignatenkobrain>	this is coming from RPM
May 11 10:31:17 <ignatenkobrain>	do you happen to have multiple copies of procps-ng?
May 11 10:31:22 <zbyszek>	rpm, please explain yourself!
May 11 10:31:36 <zbyszek>	# rpm -q procps-ng
May 11 10:31:36 <zbyszek>	procps-ng-3.3.10-18.fc28.x86_64
May 11 10:32:29 <zbyszek>	Oh, I get it. /usr/sbin is a symlink to /usr/bin.
May 11 10:32:36 <zbyszek>	Mea culpa.
May 11 10:32:45 <pjones>	still, that error message is crap
May 11 10:33:25 <zbyszek>	Yeah, a thing to watch out for if we ever do the great bin-sbin unification.
May 11 10:33:38 <pjones>	also rpmbuild probably ought to notice that one is a symlink to the other when you're building the package and warn about the fact that you've got it as two entries in %files
May 11 10:33:55 <pjones>	(or, rather, that they're the same file)
May 11 10:37:27 <zbyszek>	pjones: no, it's my filesystem that has sbin→bin symlink
May 11 10:37:37 <pjones>	zbyszek: right, but everyone's does
May 11 10:37:47 <zbyszek>	No, not in Fedora
May 11 10:37:57 <pjones>	oh, indeed
May 11 10:38:04 <pjones>	was thinking /usr vs not /usr, rather than /sbin vs /bin
May 11 10:38:05 <zbyszek>	Arch does that, and I was testing if it would be feasible
May 11 10:38:16 <zbyszek>	The split is 99% obsolete
May 11 10:38:26 <zbyszek>	But unfortunately it's still required by consolehelper
May 11 10:38:48 <zbyszek>	If we get rid of that, we can have just one directory for executables
May 11 10:39:29 <pjones>	anyway, in any case if two files are on the same filesystem and have the same inode number, *and so does the directory they're in*, and are listed in the rpm twice, that's probably worth a warning
May 11 10:39:45 <pjones>	because it'll cause that same issue in lots of cases
May 11 10:40:28 <pjones>	you don't even need to walk the tree to find the symlinks, just checking the directory's inode and checking the fsid from fstatfs() will tell you
May 11 10:44:08 <zbyszek>	I think the package is fine, it has /usr/bin/pidof (a file) and /usr/sbin/pidof (a symlink).
May 11 10:45:33 <Son_Goku>	zbyszek, Arch has the benefit of pacman not caring about a great deal of things
May 11 10:45:49 <Son_Goku>	(though I'm not sure that's _really_ a benefit)
May 11 10:55:21 <sgallagh>	FESCo meeting in about five minutes over in #fedora-meeting
May 11 11:22:31 <radez>	eclipseo: ping, I got that ansible-runner package built for f29 and f28 and it landed in updates-testing fro f28, is there something that I need to do to get it to land in the development repos?
May 11 11:22:48 <radez>	other than build it against master
May 11 11:24:39 <sharkcz>	radez: it's only waiting for a successful compose (run daily), then for mirrors to be updated, no action needed
May 11 11:25:03 <radez>	sharkcz: cool, thx for the info sharkcz
May 11 12:40:04 <tibbs>	Ugh, selinux.
May 11 12:40:29 <tibbs>	So I maintain a package (cyrus-imapd) which underwent significant changes due to a major version upgrade.
May 11 12:41:06 <tibbs>	The central selinux policy has modules for cyrus-imapd but now they're out of date and basically don't apply at all.
May 11 12:41:22 <rsc>	tibbs: ship your own policy in your package?
May 11 12:41:23 <tibbs>	I'm not sure what the best course of action is, given that I have no idea how to rewrite the policy myself.
May 11 12:41:28 <rsc>	Ah.
May 11 12:42:04 <tibbs>	I can't ship my own policy as long as the distro-wide policy includes a conflicting policy as far as I know.
May 11 12:42:24 <sfix>	you can, if your package installs it with a higher priority
May 11 12:42:40 <tibbs>	I didn't know where was any concept of priority.
May 11 12:42:50 <sfix>	i.e. semodule -X 400 -i
May 11 12:42:55 <sfix>	i.e. semodule -X 400 -i <my_module.ext>
May 11 12:43:10 <sfix>	the priority for system policies is 100
May 11 12:43:23 <sfix>	so using something higher than that will overwrite it
May 11 12:43:28 <tibbs>	The real problem is that I have no time at the moment to learn to write policy.
May 11 12:46:14 <sfix>	is shipping your app in permissive mode viable? it's your only real option without policy work (and getting fedora-selinux on it could take some time)
May 11 12:46:46 <tibbs>	I think enough has changed that the important parts run as unconfined_t anyway.
May 11 12:47:04 <tibbs>	At least I haven't seen any bug reports from actual denials, only a report that things run as unconfined.
May 11 12:47:10 <sfix>	ah
May 11 12:49:35 <sfix>	as always, I'm happy to take a look at any denials and the current policy, but this is a recurring issue among many modules in fedora-selinux
May 11 12:49:57 <sfix>	or well, in your case, what the process is running as
May 11 13:14:24 <tibbs>	sfix: Sorry, someone came to the office for an overly long chat.
May 11 13:15:42 <tibbs>	My understanding of selinux is basically limited to how to set file contexts and how to use audit2allow.  I don't understand anything about the internals of policy, and I'm not really sure where to start if I did want to learn more.
May 11 13:29:35 <bowlofeggs>	tibbs: i wrote an selinux policy for ejabberd that i carry in its own spec file, if you want an example to look at.
May 11 13:30:04 <bowlofeggs>	tibbs: it was originally in the system-wide policy, but i had an *impossible* time getting PRs to it reviewed/merged/built into RPMs
May 11 13:30:23 <bowlofeggs>	in fact, i have PRs open to *remove* it from system-wide policy that nobody is reviewing/merging, for *months*
May 11 13:30:25 <tibbs>	I'll have a look.  If I ever get the time, that is.
May 11 13:30:29 <bowlofeggs>	i've poked them a couple times
May 11 13:31:02 <bowlofeggs>	i strongly recommend against trying to get the central policy updated - it seems extremely underresourced
May 11 13:31:12 <tibbs>	Yes, it's unfortunate.
May 11 13:31:23 <bowlofeggs>	tibbs: see the .fc, .if, and .te files at https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ejabberd/tree/master
May 11 13:31:44 <tibbs>	There are some packaging guidelines in the pipeline as well.
May 11 13:31:54 <bowlofeggs>	tibbs: note that i am *not* an expert at selinux, so this is more just about how to package this if you have it and not as much about best practices for writing a policy
May 11 13:32:11 <bowlofeggs>	however, this policy was originally reviewed by upstream selinux policy
May 11 13:32:15 <bowlofeggs>	i've adjusted it from there
May 11 13:32:25 <tibbs>	Well it would be nice to see what works to override the central policy, at least.
May 11 13:32:29 <bowlofeggs>	so i didn't do it entirely in a vacuum
May 11 13:32:49 <bowlofeggs>	tibbs: this seems to override it, but i don't know why
May 11 13:32:59 <bowlofeggs>	might just be accidental
May 11 13:33:29 <bowlofeggs>	that's part of why i've been trying to get them to remove it because i'm not confident that my policy always wins
May 11 13:34:12 <bowlofeggs>	that reminds me, i should bttt my thread about this
May 11 14:06:34 <tibbs>	bowlofeggs: Heh, my situation might be more interesting because this package is also a part of RHEL8.
May 11 14:07:23 <tibbs>	Red Hat folks can say that they don't know what the next version will be called, but bugzilla certainly says "Product: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8" and "Version: 8.0", so....
May 11 14:22:23 <sfix>	tibbs: no problem, was just heading home from the office myself.  If you can point me to the 2 versions of your package I can have a look at why the upstream policy is broken.
May 11 14:26:20 <tibbs>	It's broken because a number of files changed locations.  This means that at the very least, the file contexts are all wrong.
May 11 14:27:08 <tibbs>	The package is cyrus-imapd.  A recent build is at https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1078183
May 11 14:36:10 <grift>	bowlofeggs: line 67 redundant, included with call on 29
May 11 14:36:24 <grift>	line 26 idem ditto
May 11 14:36:42 <grift>	line 27 idem ditto except for "listen accept"
May 11 14:37:05 <grift>	line err 25
May 11 14:37:34 <grift>	line 27 55 and 57 should be replaced by "logging_send_syslog_msg()"
May 11 14:39:13 <grift>	line 63 should be replaced by append_files_pattern, read_files_pattern, setattr_files_pattern and rename_files_pattern if possible (processes generally open log files for append only , dont wnt a compromised ejabberd to delete log entries and hide its audit trail
May 11 14:40:10 <grift>	the postgres and/or mysql calls should be placed in optional blocks
May 11 14:40:59 <grift>	otherwise looks ok but line 36 is questionable
May 11 14:45:19 <grift>	the if file references types that arent required: ejabberd_initrc_exec_t, ejabberd_unit_t
May 11 14:46:03 <tibbs>	Ugh, the chrome-gnome-shell package messes with some other vendor's opt hierarchy.
May 11 15:30:19 <bowlofeggs>	grift++ thanks!
May 11 15:30:33 <bowlofeggs>	grift: i filed https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1577363 to track your suggestions
May 11 15:31:56 <nirik>	sgallagh: who could I talk to about the freeipa project space on fedorapeople? any ideas?
May 11 15:32:17 <grift>	k with regard to ejabberd_log_t you can probably ommit rename_files_pattern() since its maintained by logrotate
May 11 15:32:48 <grift>	so just append read, setattr ejabberd log files
May 11 15:34:54 <bowlofeggs>	cool thanks so much for the tips!
May 11 15:34:55 <sgallagh>	nirik: Probably mkosek
May 11 15:38:20 <nirik>	sgallagh: ok, on irc anywhere? or email likely better?
May 11 15:39:29 <sgallagh>	In Brno, so probably email is better at this hour.
May 11 15:41:50 <nirik>	ok, thanks.
May 11 15:46:29 <glima>	heheh
May 11 15:46:30 <glima>	heheh

May 14 11:45:12 <cstratak>	jhford, networking in mock is disabled by default now as far as I recall. You can enable it by a flag while initiating the build '--enable-network' or at the config file add: config_opts['rpmbuild_networking'] = True
May 14 11:45:42 <jhford>	cstratak: cheers.  i know it's a bad idea to do this, but we're well aware of the problems here :)
May 14 11:45:53 <jhford>	is it me, or is it no longer using bare chroots?

May 14 15:44:46 *	nb hopes not
May 14 15:44:47 <spot>	nb: it's a team effort, but stickster is probably the right person to talk to.
May 14 17:56:11 <stickster>	nb: Hi!
May 14 17:57:13 <stickster>	nb: Sorry, just sat back down at desk after an appt. "Covered" doesn't really mean a lot in this case. What is meaningful, though -- hopefully this will help -- is to understand that the "right to delete" is not absolute. It is balanced against legitimate business interests among other concerns
May 14 17:58:37 <stickster>	This is important in the case of an open source community when that community (like Fedora) has an overwhelming interest in maintaining the integrity of public-facing information
May 14 20:43:12 <nb>	stickster, ah ok, that does help
May 14 22:09:56 <LetoThinkpad>	Package fedora-upgrade-27.1-1.fc27.noarch is already installed, skipping.
May 14 22:10:28 <LetoThinkpad>	paul@thinkpad:~$ fedora-upgrade
May 14 22:10:28 <LetoThinkpad>	Going to upgrade your Fedora to rawhide.
May 14 22:10:28 <LetoThinkpad>	Fedora 28 is currently under development.
May 14 22:10:28 <LetoThinkpad>	Are you sure?
May 14 22:10:46 <LetoThinkpad>	why does it want to upgrade from f27 to rawhide?
May 14 22:11:04 <LetoThinkpad>	why does it say f28 is 'under development' two weeks after it is released?
May 14 22:14:33 <DrNick>	probably because that's an unofficial tool that's out of date
May 14 22:27:24 <sdgathman>	The contract for Java System.loadLibrary(<name>) says it "finds and load the library in a system dependent manner".
May 14 22:27:47 <paragan>	LetoThinkpad, https://fedoramagazine.org/upgrading-fedora-27-fedora-28/
May 14 22:28:18 <sdgathman>	Why can't openjdk Java installed by Fedora search for the library in the place mandated by Fedora packaging guidelines?
May 14 22:29:26 <sdgathman>	Why make every Java package patch the source to look in the Fedora locations explicitly using System.load(<path>)?
May 14 22:30:50 *	sdgathman embarks on mission to find source for Fedora openjdk to see how it searches for loadLibrary()
May 14 22:31:50 <sdgathman>	Asking on #fedora-java
May 14 23:06:00 <LetoThinkpad>	oh I see. okay maybe that tool should be disabled more clearly and point to the new official way :P
May 14 23:06:43 <LetoThinkpad>	but good to see more apt/dns convergence. Next we only need to rename apt/dnf into something both flavours will use and we are good to go :)
May 14 23:10:02 <LetoThinkpad>	package dnf-utils-2.1.5-4.fc28.noarch conflicts with yum-utils provided by yum-utils-1.1.31-514.fc28.noarch
May 14 23:10:07 <LetoThinkpad>	blech :)
May 14 23:11:19 <LetoThinkpad>	  - nss-pem-1.0.3-6.fc27.x86_64 does not belong to a distupgrade repository
May 14 23:11:21 <LetoThinkpad>	eww
May 14 23:11:29 <LetoThinkpad>	so that causes me to have to remove all of wine before I can upgrade :P
May 14 23:19:12 <tmz>	LetoThinkpad: I think an alternative to removing wine is 'dnf install nss-pem-1.0.3-9.fc28 --releasever=28' per https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1553646#c37
May 15 00:09:16 <DrNick>	LetoThinkpad: --allowerasing --best
May 15 03:59:35 <ibotty>	Hi, what's the status of the container registry. I just noticed that most containers are still not on 28 (if the search interface is to be believed)
May 15 03:59:57 <ibotty>	Is there some discussion holding it back or can one help out?
May 15 04:49:48 <fidencio>	I'm facing some issues with `fedpkg mockbuild`: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/n~rXIuzAKMdXCNdlMo4y9g
May 15 04:49:58 <fidencio>	may I ask some help to understand the issue and a possible fix?
May 15 04:52:36 <fidencio>	and the reason I'm trying to run a mockbuild is because of ttp://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=26972739 ... which fails only on armv7hl
May 15 04:52:48 <fidencio>	is there a knwon issue on armv7hl?
May 15 04:56:45 <misc>	you have looked at the warning in https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/2740/26972740/build.log ?
May 15 05:04:39 <fidencio>	misc: I did, the issue is actually: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/UUVCvpBnu7zAhtkL9R1PaA
May 15 05:05:24 <fidencio>	misc: and I'm actually trying to debug it, but then I'm facing the mock issue I've pasted above ...
May 15 05:05:36 <fidencio>	misc: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/n~rXIuzAKMdXCNdlMo4y9g
May 15 05:05:49 <fidencio>	misc: any idea what can be done to pass this step?
May 15 05:07:17 *	misc wait on paste to load
May 15 05:08:58 <misc>	fidencio: mhh not really :/
May 15 05:09:26 <misc>	seems to be some rawhide issue
May 15 05:09:46 <misc>	so maybe try on f28 ?
May 15 05:16:04 <fidencio>	misc: very same issue when trying to use f28
May 15 05:16:26 <fidencio>	and now I'm in a kind of not so comfortable situation as a build error happen on an arch that I have no way to test :-/
May 15 05:19:55 <misc>	fidencio: you could do a scratch build I guess
May 15 05:20:46 <fidencio>	misc: local build you mean?
May 15 05:21:10 <fidencio>	misc: a scratch build will trigger the issue on the server ... that I know that will happen. what I need is a way to debug it
May 15 05:23:12 <misc>	fidencio: oh, I tought you already had a patch for that
May 15 05:23:23 <misc>	so the warning do not appear on x86 ?
May 15 05:23:23 <mizdebsk>	fidencio, you can try reproducing the issue on one of test machines, https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Machine_Resources_For_Package_Maintainers
May 15 05:23:45 <fidencio>	misc: there's no error no any other arch but the armv7
May 15 05:23:54 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: mock doesn't work there either
May 15 05:24:15 <mizdebsk>	it should; did you use the same mock config as koji uses?
May 15 05:24:18 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: shows me the very same error I'm dealing with the local VM
May 15 05:24:41 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: maybe? I'm not sure. I'm on f28 branch of my project and I call `fedpkg mockbuild`
May 15 05:24:51 <mizdebsk>	that's a different config
May 15 05:25:03 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: so, which config I should use? (and how?)
May 15 05:25:27 <mizdebsk>	you can run "koji mock-config" to generate the config and then run mock -r to use it
May 15 05:25:51 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: so, fedpkg mockbuild is not supposed to work at all?
May 15 05:26:23 <mizdebsk>	"fedpkg mockbuild" uses upstream mock configs, which point to different repos than koji uses
May 15 05:26:49 <mizdebsk>	koji doesn't use upstream configs, but for each task it generates new, custom config
May 15 05:28:29 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: so, I should use koji mock-config --buildroot <buildroot-id, being it the id of the buildroot used in my scratch build that failed?>
May 15 05:29:59 <mizdebsk>	koji mock-config --task 26972740 >my.cfg
May 15 05:30:04 <mizdebsk>	mock -r my.cfg
May 15 05:31:00 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: okay, and  in case I'd like to check with an upstream mock config ... just to be sure that the problem is *not* in our infra ... what shall I do as fedpkg mockbuild doesn't work?
May 15 05:32:33 <mizdebsk>	what's the problem with fedpkg mockbuild? it seems i joined after you posted it
May 15 05:33:02 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/n~rXIuzAKMdXCNdlMo4y9g
May 15 05:33:30 <mizdebsk>	aha, yes
May 15 05:33:53 <mizdebsk>	replace "groupinstall build" with "groupinstall buildsys-build" in your config
May 15 05:34:02 <mizdebsk>	or run mock with argument "--enablerepo local"
May 15 05:34:52 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: which config?
May 15 05:34:53 <juhp>	why is `fedpkg new-sources ...` failing for me with "Could not execute new_sources: Request is unauthorized."?
May 15 05:35:09 <mizdebsk>	fidencio, /etc/mock/default.cfg
May 15 05:35:13 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: bear with me here ... because I haven't changed *any* config from the default mock at all
May 15 05:35:33 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: and I'd really expected that fedpkg could work out-of-the-box
May 15 05:35:55 <mizdebsk>	is this some shared machine like fedora test ones?
May 15 05:36:02 <mizdebsk>	someone could've modified the conf
May 15 05:36:13 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: no,it's a fresh f27 installation
May 15 05:36:24 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: config_opts['chroot_setup_cmd'] = 'install @buildsys-build'
May 15 05:37:02 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: it was like this already
May 15 05:37:46 <mizdebsk>	i don't know which config is used by fedpkg, but the log indicates that "groupinstall build" was used, not "install @buildsys-build"
May 15 05:38:07 <fidencio>	is there a fedpkg specific channel?
May 15 05:38:41 <fidencio>	or is there any fedpkg developer here?
May 15 05:40:31 *	mizdebsk is not aware of any channel better than this one
May 15 05:40:54 <mizdebsk>	better for fedpkg questions, that is
May 15 05:46:36 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: hmm. I'm runnig a mock -r my.cfg --shell ... let's see if it works
May 15 05:46:49 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: misc: thanks for the help so far
May 15 05:48:51 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: mock -r my.cfg --shell -N and later using fedpkg -N I guess is the way to go from here
May 15 06:16:18 <fidencio>	trying to use `fedpkg mockbuild --config my.cfg -N` I get: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/5Jwqm3Q2UHT4cxxSrhKpcg
May 15 06:16:46 <fidencio>	and that's the config I got from the task
May 15 06:21:52 <mizdebsk>	fidencio, that's config for mock, not fedpkg
May 15 06:21:58 <mizdebsk>	fedpkg can't parse it
May 15 06:22:09 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: aha
May 15 06:22:26 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: okay, let me wait till mock -r my.cfg --rebuild ...
May 15 06:54:56 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/I8vZDJG38MhZBiea9dB2Pg
May 15 07:12:56 <mizdebsk>	fidencio, you need to have yum-utils installed
May 15 07:14:29 <mizdebsk>	or better, switch to dnf in /etc/mock/site-defaults.cfg
May 15 07:15:38 <fidencio>	mizdebsk: I ended up calling mock with --dnf, I guess that has the same effect
May 15 07:15:47 <mizdebsk>	yep
May 15 07:19:22 <ibotty>	Hi! I asked before but got no answer. Sorry for spamming. What's the status of the container registry? Most containers are still on f27. Is something holding it back or can one easily help out?
May 15 07:19:40 <ibotty>	If there is a channel more appropriate, please direct me to it ;)
May 15 07:20:14 <mizdebsk>	ibotty, ask in #fedora-releng
May 15 07:20:18 <ibotty>	k
May 15 07:20:21 <ibotty>	thanks!
May 15 07:35:28 <fidencio>	I've seen some armv7 related issue on fedora-devel ML, I guess that's exactly what has been kicking me :-)
May 15 08:06:10 <rineau>	Hi, here I am because I need help with the Fedora CGAL package that I maintain. That is my first time on IRC... Well, not my first time, but last time that was probably about 20 years ago, when I was a young student.
May 15 08:06:39 <rineau>	My problem is my last build of CGAL, in Rawhide: https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1076145
May 15 08:07:02 *	jsmith looks
May 15 08:07:09 <rineau>	It has been stuck in f29-pending for 2 weeks.
May 15 08:07:29 <jsmith>	rineau: OK, you'll probably want to open a rel-eng ticket for that
May 15 08:08:00 <rineau>	I have seen discussion about the gating of rawhide. Is that is place already?
May 15 08:08:06 <cstratak>	rineau, also check out the #fedora-admin channel, many folks dealing with those issues hang out there.
May 15 08:30:35 <stickster>	puiterwijk: Good afternoon :-)
May 15 08:30:49 <puiterwijk>	stickster: hi
May 15 08:31:00 <stickster>	puiterwijk: wanted to bring this to your attention, a hot and critical CVE: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1567974
May 15 08:32:45 <stickster>	landgraf: Thanks for https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/dhcp/c/16546798c589bd0a06a04460fde5628925c7fba0?branch=master
May 15 08:32:59 <puiterwijk>	stickster: thanks.
May 15 08:34:07 <stickster>	puiterwijk: I'm getting a Fedora Magazine article ready -- will direct folks to the kojipkgs links for the moment, but also with instructions for how to update once in updates-testing
May 15 08:34:21 <stickster>	looks like f26 version is almost ready
May 15 08:34:39 <puiterwijk>	stickster: :(... Can we wait like one hour before we publish so we can get the updates out?
May 15 08:34:59 <puiterwijk>	Because I really don't want users download from kojipkgs directly, as that's going to severely impact the build system
May 15 08:35:10 <puiterwijk>	(or at least, run the risk of)
May 15 08:35:18 <stickster>	puiterwijk: Sure, if we can get the updates out that quickly I'll happily wait!
May 15 08:35:19 <landgraf>	stickster: f27 and f28 updates  are waiting for some karma :)
May 15 08:35:36 <stickster>	landgraf: *nod, I'm going to stop by #fedora-qa to see if someone can assist
May 15 08:35:40 <landgraf>	https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-23ca7a6798  https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-36058ed9f2
May 15 08:36:16 <landgraf>	stickster: thx
May 15 08:36:53 <puiterwijk>	stickster: I'm doing my best to get them out asap right now
May 15 08:37:27 <puiterwijk>	landgraf: do you happen to have the f26 update link for me?
May 15 08:37:45 <landgraf>	puiterwijk: koji build is in progress still
May 15 08:37:46 <stickster>	I think that one's still building
May 15 08:37:49 <stickster>	*jinx
May 15 08:37:51 <landgraf>	arm is slow
May 15 08:37:51 <puiterwijk>	Ah, okay
May 15 08:37:56 <puiterwijk>	Ugh...... Yeah...
May 15 08:38:14 <puiterwijk>	I'll wait for that update to get filed, so we can send all of them out at the same time
May 15 08:39:35 <puiterwijk>	landgraf: got a link to the build?
May 15 08:40:02 <puiterwijk>	I want to make sure it's not on the builder that just died
May 15 08:40:24 <landgraf>	puiterwijk: stickster: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-5392896132
May 15 08:40:32 <puiterwijk>	Ah, great. Thanks
May 15 08:40:52 <puiterwijk>	Going to wati for to be signed, and then I'll push these out
May 15 08:43:07 <puiterwijk>	Updates for f26, f27 and f28 going out now
May 15 08:53:45 <stickster>	ksinny: ^ This may also be important for you -- we probably want a new Fedora Atomic host with this rolled in
May 15 08:53:50 <stickster>	er, a new ostree that is
May 15 08:53:56 <puiterwijk>	stickster: just informing dustymabe in #fedora-releng :)
May 15 08:54:01 <stickster>	thanks puiterwijk  :-)
May 15 08:54:19 <stickster>	I saw something that he may be on PTO, but maybe that was for tomorrow
May 15 08:54:48 <puiterwijk>	Right. I saw him talk earlier, so figured he was around.
May 15 08:55:43 <ksinny>	stickster: Thanks! we will probbaly delay a bit 2 week release to get CVE included
May 15 08:56:38 <dustymabe>	yeah PTO starts on thursday
May 15 08:57:05 <stickster>	cool
May 15 08:57:35 <stickster>	ksinny: dustymabe: I'm going to go ahead with the article once the updates-testing packages are ready. I'll update the article with Atomic info once you have that ready.
May 15 08:58:05 <puiterwijk>	stickster: I'll ping you when everything's out and emergency switch is pulled
May 15 08:58:09 <stickster>	For now it'll have a placeholder "Fedora Atomic host is being updated with these packages and will be available shortly. This article will be updated once that happens."
May 15 08:58:13 <stickster>	puiterwijk: Thanks
May 15 08:59:34 <ksinny>	stickster: sure
May 15 09:05:50 <stickster>	puiterwijk: I think this is a pretty simple explanation (on purpose), but could you check https://fedoramagazine.org/?p=21356&preview=1&_ppp=7b5a536b4f for me?
May 15 09:06:07 *	puiterwijk checks
May 15 09:06:56 <puiterwijk>	stickster: "especially if you use untrusted networks such as a WiFi access point you don’t own" - this is the case on any network, including work. Since any attacker on the same braodcast range can attack
May 15 09:07:29 <stickster>	puiterwijk: Sure. It's probably less of a risk on a home network that's not open, though.
May 15 09:07:38 <stickster>	Unless your family really has it in for you ;-)
May 15 09:07:52 <puiterwijk>	stickster: .... I have a different vlan from anyone else on my network :)
May 15 09:08:17 <puiterwijk>	Also: ". If you don’t get an update right away, wait until later in the day."  - after I pull the emergency switch, people will get it. Because every mirror without it will be marked as "outdated"
May 15 09:08:25 <stickster>	ah, gotcha
May 15 09:08:42 <puiterwijk>	That's what the "Emergency switch" does :)
May 15 09:08:51 <misc>	I wonder if it wouldn't help to have the CVE number somewhere
May 15 09:08:59 <stickster>	misc: good call, I'll add that
May 15 09:09:09 <stickster>	puiterwijk: I think I can eliminate that paragraph entirely then.
May 15 09:09:16 <stickster>	I think the "especially" paragraph is accurate, though.
May 15 09:09:30 <stickster>	"This is bad no matter what, and it's REALLY bad if you can't trust your network."
May 15 09:09:33 <puiterwijk>	stickster: sure. Just nitpicky
May 15 09:09:35 <misc>	also, what about Fedora Atomic Workstation/silverblue ?
May 15 09:09:44 <puiterwijk>	misc: that'll get updated with this same push
May 15 09:09:52 <puiterwijk>	So that will go out as soon as the updates are stable
May 15 09:10:01 <misc>	puiterwijk: yeah, i guess so, but I wonder if that should be mentionned :)
May 15 09:10:07 <puiterwijk>	Ahhh, right. Yeah
May 15 09:10:31 <misc>	I am also surprised, wasn't NM supposed to have its own dhcp client code ?
May 15 09:10:54 <pingou>	stickster: the article doesn't say which package version I should look for
May 15 09:11:04 <puiterwijk>	misc: I think that they might, but then still use the dhcp-client code for compatibility purposes?
May 15 09:12:14 <misc>	puiterwijk: possible. I also wonder if there is some selinux containement to add here
May 15 09:12:32 <misc>	even if, that's a script, so people would expect to do _anything_
May 15 09:12:52 <puiterwijk>	Right. Though I think those scripts tend to do things like actually configure network parameters
May 15 09:12:56 <stickster>	pingou: fixed
May 15 09:12:58 <tomhughes>	yeah - the like NM dispatcher scripts are where selinux usually becomes hopeless
May 15 09:13:31 <pingou>	stickster: thanks
May 15 09:14:28 <misc>	puiterwijk: yeah, but "configure network" do not mean it should be able to do outbound connexion, for example
May 15 09:14:42 <misc>	at least at the dhcp level
May 15 09:14:44 <puiterwijk>	misc: except when it's needed :).
May 15 09:15:01 <misc>	puiterwijk: yeah, then a boolean would be toggled
May 15 09:15:11 <puiterwijk>	Right
May 15 09:15:37 <misc>	now, I do network access with script (mostly automated webportal stuff), but there is likely some middle ground here :/
May 15 09:15:38 <puiterwijk>	misc: note: I'm fully in favor of sandboxing the scripts. I'm just saying that "compatibility" is.... seen as impiortant
May 15 09:15:40 *	puiterwijk points at https://xkcd.com/1172/
May 15 09:16:31 <tomhughes>	they are sandboxed aren't they? I always seem to have adsd tons of policy whenever I write a custom script before selinux will let it run
May 15 09:16:52 <misc>	depend which scripts we are speaking of
May 15 09:17:11 <misc>	the one ran by /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ , I do not think so
May 15 09:17:22 <tomhughes>	the NM dispatcher scripts (and ppp up/down scripts, openvpn up/down scripts etc etc)
May 15 09:22:35 <puiterwijk>	f26 and f27 u-t are out, f28 is taking its longer
May 15 09:30:48 <stickster>	puiterwijk: OK, I've got the article ready to go now and can pull the switch once you're ready. Is Rawhide treated the same, i.e. it's out with the emergency switch as well?
May 15 09:31:12 <puiterwijk>	stickster: rawhide only gets composed nightly.
May 15 09:31:27 <puiterwijk>	So unless I perform more magic, rawhide will get it tomorrow.
May 15 09:31:28 <stickster>	OK, that means I need to update the article then vs what you reviewed
May 15 09:31:43 <puiterwijk>	I can look at performing more magic. But.. as said, that's magic
May 15 09:31:55 <puiterwijk>	(i.e. not regularly tested)
May 15 09:32:33 <stickster>	puiterwijk: For Rawhide I feel like it's OK to tell people to koji download-build... I imagine that's very few people.
May 15 09:32:41 <stickster>	relatively speaking
May 15 09:32:50 <puiterwijk>	Right
May 15 09:36:04 <stickster>	puiterwijk: https://fedoramagazine.org/?p=21356&preview=1&_ppp=7b5a536b4f
May 15 09:37:00 <stickster>	Oops, just updated again, storry
May 15 09:37:02 <stickster>	*sorry.
May 15 09:38:20 <stickster>	Fixed formatting
May 15 09:38:33 <puiterwijk>	stickster: just for curiosity sake: we don't consider gnome-software as "official" enough to mention it in the article?
May 15 09:38:46 <stickster>	Nope
May 15 09:38:50 <puiterwijk>	Okay.
May 15 09:38:59 <stickster>	Well, it *is* but I think the caching mechanisms for PackageKit become too confusing
May 15 09:39:11 <stickster>	So we just go to the CLI for absolute certainty
May 15 09:39:20 <puiterwijk>	Right. I don't disagree, but I think that this is something that should get addressed...
May 15 09:39:52 <puiterwijk>	Because when I last looked at e.g. the FOSDEM booth, it's what we market as the official way to install packages and updates
May 15 09:39:56 <stickster>	Plus the software repository configuration there is always persistent. Meaning the person will have to go back and remove the updates-testing
May 15 09:40:27 <puiterwijk>	Anyway, sure. Was just curious
May 15 09:40:35 <stickster>	If we had a way to push a critical notice that allowed a one-shot update... *that* would be cool
May 15 09:40:55 <stickster>	kalev: ^ just for your consideration as a "nice to have"
May 15 09:41:15 <stickster>	puiterwijk: how's the f28 u-t going?
May 15 09:41:30 <puiterwijk>	stickster: the compose is done, and now waiting to be synced out to the master mirror
May 15 09:41:35 <stickster>	Okey dokey
May 15 09:41:42 <kalev>	stickster: ahh, that would be nice indeed, good idea
May 15 09:41:51 <puiterwijk>	Some steps of this process take longer than I'd like, but we should be reasonably close
May 15 09:42:06 <stickster>	puiterwijk: An hour seems pretty darned good to me!
May 15 09:42:28 *	stickster notices nothing on https://www.redhat.com/archives/rhsa-announce/2018-May/thread.html yet
May 15 09:42:31 <puiterwijk>	Well, I've already "broken the SLA", as it's 7 minutes past what I'd promised.
May 15 09:42:37 <puiterwijk>	And we're not there yet
May 15 09:42:43 <stickster>	puiterwijk: sounds like that agreement may be unfair :-D
May 15 09:45:11 *	stickster holds finger on button
May 15 09:45:15 <stickster>	ok, not really ;-)
May 15 09:45:59 *	puiterwijk tries to hurry this sync stuff along and notes that we're still limited by physics, unfortunately :(
May 15 09:46:14 <stickster>	lol
May 15 09:46:47 <smooge>	i have some ideas on how to get round that. Please invest in my new startup Trolling4DollasBlockChain
May 15 09:47:01 <stickster>	darn it, Ørsted
May 15 09:47:09 <stickster>	smooge: "myfirstferrari"
May 15 09:47:31 <smooge>	lambo
May 15 09:48:30 <halfline>	tachyoncoin
May 15 09:52:49 <smooge>	halfline, pretty much.
May 15 09:53:08 <smooge>	ok outage here over. see you when I get home.
May 15 09:53:31 <halfline>	i wonder how much computational power is needed to mine those coins
May 15 09:54:15 <landgraf>	puiterwijk: f27 and f28 have enough karma but f28 is stuck in pending testing so I am not able to push it
May 15 09:54:33 <puiterwijk>	landgraf: right, that'll get fixed as soon as it is unlocked (i.e. when the push finished)
May 15 09:54:41 <puiterwijk>	Should be real soon now, I can let you know when
May 15 09:55:06 <landgraf>	puiterwijk: ok. thanks
May 15 09:58:00 <puiterwijk>	landgraf: f28 is now marked as Done ,and you can push to stable
May 15 09:58:08 <puiterwijk>	I'm just waiting for the sync to master mirror to finish
May 15 09:59:45 <puiterwijk>	landgraf, stickster: do we want to wait for f26 to get enough karma, or just push f27/f28 out to stable? (still waiting for master mirror to pick up the new contents for u-t)
May 15 10:00:10 <puiterwijk>	I am guessing we do want to push those first. Especially f28, so we can build 2wa stuff
May 15 10:00:18 <puiterwijk>	(and the Atomic Workstation)
May 15 10:03:06 <landgraf>	puiterwijk: sure. I'd prefer to have f28 and f27 stable asap
May 15 10:03:08 <stickster>	puiterwijk: Yes, let's push 27/28 to stable,
May 15 10:03:14 <landgraf>	f26 is EOL'ed soon
May 15 10:03:15 <puiterwijk>	Okay, that's what I figured.
May 15 10:03:17 <stickster>	*jinx, Looks like everyone's agreed
May 15 10:03:26 <puiterwijk>	And why I had actually just pressed y :)
May 15 10:03:29 <stickster>	ha
May 15 10:03:30 <landgraf>	that's why nobody cares )
May 15 10:04:37 <stickster>	puiterwijk: I'm still holding on the article until I know we're good for at least u-t (if not stable) on everything
May 15 10:04:56 <puiterwijk>	stickster: yeah, I'm watching the sync out to master mirrors
May 15 10:05:07 <puiterwijk>	I will let you know immediately as soon as everything should be in place
May 15 10:05:13 <stickster>	I know for a fact we have plenty of users who are still sitting on F26 and if they can't run what we tell them, we'll catch hell in comments ;_0
May 15 10:05:40 <stickster>	h👍
May 15 10:05:41 <puiterwijk>	Oh, I don't doubt that for one minute
May 15 10:05:54 *	puiterwijk knows someone who's still at fc6....
May 15 10:06:07 <puiterwijk>	(nope, that's not a typo)
May 15 10:06:52 <pingou>	nasa?
May 15 10:07:59 <puiterwijk>	If only
May 15 10:09:30 <stickster>	yikes
May 15 10:10:10 <tomhughes>	I've got an RH7.3 machine here ;-)
May 15 10:10:19 <tomhughes>	it's VM used for doing builds...
May 15 10:12:53 <landgraf>	stickster: I've received few pings from f26 users just now. we need more karma on f26 update =)
May 15 10:13:13 <stickster>	landgraf: Do you know anyone on F26 who can contribute karma?
May 15 10:13:13 <puiterwijk>	Well, at least for next time I know not to promise 1 hour, but probably 2... :(. needs work to get that down
May 15 10:13:28 <stickster>	I would kind of turn that back to those users, honestly ;-)
May 15 10:14:59 <stickster>	landgraf: in any case, it'll be available in updates-testing so the only question is when it goes to stable
May 15 10:24:53 <ykarel>	Hi, can someone help me understand the behaviour
May 15 10:25:22 <ykarel>	[root@keystonepoc puppet-openstack]# dnf repoquery --whatprovides python-heatclient
May 15 10:25:22 <ykarel>	Last metadata expiration check: 0:22:31 ago on Tue 15 May 2018 01:59:35 PM UTC.
May 15 10:25:23 <ykarel>	python2-heatclient-0:1.11.0-2.fc28.noarch
May 15 10:25:23 <ykarel>	python2-heatclient-0:1.15.0-0.20180425132804.aab5b85.el7.centos.noarch
May 15 10:25:46 <ykarel>	But when i try to install python-heatclient it says:- Error: Unable to find a match
May 15 10:26:42 <stickster>	It looks to me like you have both Fedora and CentOS repos active on the same box which seems odd
May 15 10:26:44 <Zord>	python-heatclient is likely the command whereas python2-heatclient is the actual package
May 15 10:27:01 <Zord>	But that is also true
May 15 10:27:02 <stickster>	But yeah
May 15 10:27:22 <stickster>	what Zord said ^
May 15 10:28:06 <ykarel>	stickster, but with fedora repos also get the same
May 15 10:28:07 <ykarel>	[root@keystonepoc puppet-openstack]# dnf repoquery --whatprovides python-heatclient

May 15 10:28:31 <ykarel>	and, dnf install --disablerepo=delorean  python-heatclient
May 15 10:28:37 <ykarel>	above works ^^
May 15 10:29:14 <stickster>	ykarel: do 'dnf install python2-heatclient' and you should be fine.
May 15 10:29:29 <stickster>	puiterwijk: are we still holding?
May 15 10:29:35 <ykarel>	stickster, yes that works, but i wanted to know why python-heatclient do not work
May 15 10:29:46 <puiterwijk>	stickster: yes. But one more step just finished
May 15 10:29:48 <ykarel>	even if it's provided by python2-heatclient
May 15 10:29:52 <stickster>	cool
May 15 10:30:10 <puiterwijk>	I'm now making mirrormanager check the master mirror to ingest the new repomd's
May 15 10:30:22 <stickster>	ykarel: no idea, but it works fine here.
May 15 10:32:43 <stickster>	ykarel: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/GJiSo1RsuGihOjvpGG-~QQ
May 15 10:32:54 <stickster>	that was using 'python-heatclient'
May 15 10:33:43 <ykarel>	stickster, yup with just fedora repo configured it works, it fails only when other repo is added which also provides python-heatclient
May 15 10:34:22 <stickster>	puiterwijk: landgraf: f26 package is now +2 karma fwiw
May 15 10:34:29 <ykarel>	and i can't get why this happens
May 15 10:34:31 *	stickster is not suggesting redoing anything ;-)
May 15 10:34:40 <stickster>	thank you bowlofeggs for ^^^
May 15 10:34:49 <puiterwijk>	stickster: ack. I'll push it out when the f28/f27 stuff is all pushed out. In the meantime, master mirror is updated, and I'm pulling the emergency switches now
May 15 10:36:02 <puiterwijk>	Okay, repoinfo in mirrormanager is correct now. Generating and syncing out pkl
May 15 10:36:44 *	stickster puts finger over button...
May 15 10:37:29 <stickster>	ykarel: You might want to run with debugging output and read through the log to see what's happening under the covers.
May 15 10:38:21 <ykarel>	stickster, ok trying
May 15 10:38:50 *	stickster is useless at helping further but maybe there's a DNF person here who can.
May 15 10:41:07 <puiterwijk>	for my record: f28-u-t x86-64: 35bb6b9a78760e329ac5192cc483255f
May 15 10:44:44 *	stickster still poised on button... :-D
May 15 10:45:00 *	puiterwijk waiting for the last stage of the process
May 15 10:45:45 <puiterwijk>	stickster: in the meantime, I verified that the f26, 27 and 28 u-t repos from this compose (at least x86_64) have the packages mentioned in the article. :)
May 15 10:45:55 <puiterwijk>	(just to make sure that we're not missing any one of them)
May 15 10:49:28 <stickster>	nice
May 15 10:51:50 <puiterwijk>	pkls syncing out. ETA +- 5 minutes  (let's go with 10 to be sure)
May 15 10:52:04 *	stickster waits
May 15 10:53:18 *	puiterwijk twiddles thumbs. It's *so* close to done now
May 15 10:55:03 <puiterwijk>	Mirrorlists reloading data now
May 15 10:55:59 <puiterwijk>	stickster: the first mirrorlists have started serving the new pkls.
May 15 10:56:11 <EvaLuAtor>	Hello. Debian has equivs[1] which is a tool for creating trivial packages which mostly have just dependencies but can also have static files. Is there something equivalent in Fedora?
May 15 10:56:12 <stickster>	puiterwijk: OK to publish then?
May 15 10:56:22 <EvaLuAtor>	I realize that script for creating such packages will be trivial. I'm just curious if something already exists. I actually never used equivs, but I find the concept handy.
May 15 10:56:42 <stickster>	Looks like I might make my 11am meeting
May 15 10:57:20 <puiterwijk>	stickster: yes. Do it
May 15 10:58:08 <puiterwijk>	Updates are live *now*

May 15 11:01:41 <puiterwijk>	Yep, just confirmed. f26/f27/f28 all have the new updates in their repos
May 15 11:01:50 <stickster>	OK, 2.5 hours isn't bad from public disclosure to fixes live
May 15 11:02:00 <puiterwijk>	I'll try to expedite the updates push as well. They are running
May 15 11:02:12 <puiterwijk>	Also, FAW should be updated as well soon now

May 15 11:13:01 <markand>	hello
May 15 11:13:10 <markand>	what is the difference between ruby-* and rubygem-* packages?
May 15 11:14:24 <pvalena>	markand: ruby-* is the old notation. Every gem now begins with rubygem-*
May 15 11:14:50 <tibbs>	markand: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Ruby#Naming_Guidelines
May 15 11:15:21 <markand>	ruby makes development in ruby very complicated :p
May 15 11:15:22 <tibbs>	ruby-X is a ruby extension library.  rubygem-X is a gem.
May 15 11:15:46 <markand>	so there are ruby developers who do not want to use rubygems?
May 15 11:16:07 <tibbs>	I'm pretty sure there is code that predates gems.
May 15 11:16:25 <tibbs>	But ruby is simply terrible and I avoid it at all costs, so I don't really know.
May 15 11:17:05 <pvalena>	actually, even the example sqlite ext. was renamed to rubygem-sqlite3
May 15 11:17:08 <pvalena>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/rubygem-sqlite3
May 15 11:17:15 <pvalena>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ruby-sqlite3 is retired
May 15 11:18:33 <markand>	:D
May 15 11:18:53 <markand>	ruby has nice features but it's just so awful to work with
May 15 11:19:29 <pvalena>	markand: why do you think so?
May 15 11:21:06 <markand>	pvalena, most of the case, documentation out of date, packages out of dates, it looks like lot of people have left the boat
May 15 11:21:17 <jenglisch>	hi. i'm curious if https://src.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/dhcp.git/commit/?id=16546798c589bd0a06a04460fde5628925c7fba0 really fixes CVE-2018-1111 since "read -r" only treats backslashes differently. does dhcp disallow backticks, $() and other shell execution mechnisms ?
May 15 11:29:28 <pbrobinson>	stickster: hey, the wording around the dhcp flaw could be interpreted (I needed to clarify) that it could be Fedora specific and not distro generic, might be worth tweaking the wording
May 15 11:32:11 <stickster>	pbrobinson: thanks, I think I just nipped that.
May 15 11:32:28 <stickster>	really just that first sentence was the issue.
May 15 11:35:01 <stickster>	jenglisch: we can ask landgraf about the efficacy of the fix
May 15 11:40:24 <algogator>	hi puiterwijk I'm working on integrating OpenID Connect auth with the fedora happiness packets https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/fedora-happiness-packets
May 15 11:41:00 <algogator>	what do you think about this django package https://github.com/juanifioren/django-oidc-provider ?
May 15 11:41:21 <puiterwijk>	algogator: "OpenID Connect and OAuth2 provider implementation"  - i.e. that's a provided, the other side from what you need
May 15 11:42:40 <algogator>	my mistake yes the client
May 15 11:52:50 <algogator>	I just assumed the client came with it
May 15 11:53:58 <algogator>	puiterwijk, but do you know of any other django packages? or should I trying to write my own?
May 15 11:55:00 <puiterwijk>	algogator: you can look at https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-django-oidc - I would *definitely* not suggest to write you own....
May 15 11:57:18 <algogator>	ok cos I think you mentioned the last time you weren't entirely comfortable recommending it
May 15 11:58:20 <puiterwijk>	algogator: correct. But I feel way less comfortable with yet another client.
May 15 11:58:31 <puiterwijk>	Also, I personally feel less comfortable with django, but that's my opinion
May 15 11:59:12 <puiterwijk>	stickster: f28 now has the new dhcp in stable updates. f27 not yet due to reason I'll look into

May 15 14:41:33 <ajax>	'fedpkg --dist f27 srpm' though

May 15 14:43:45 <ajax>	weird, why is there that and also copr-cli
May 15 14:44:13 <ajax>	  - nothing provides /bin/python3 needed by copr-rpmbuild-0.17-1.fc28.noarch
May 15 14:44:20 <ajax>	sigh
May 15 14:45:12 <ajax>	define "wrong release" maybe?
May 15 14:46:08 <spot>	i hate compilers.
May 15 14:46:58 <spot>	with gcc8, the value of alignof(int64_t) on i686 has changed.
May 15 14:47:10 <spot>	It used to be 8. Now it's 4.

May 16 09:57:45 <carlwgeorge>	am i going crazy or is %bash_completion_dir no longer defined in fedora?
May 16 10:02:49 <rdieter>	carlwgeorge: offhand, I don't recall that ever being defined
May 16 10:03:19 <rdieter>	carlwgeorge: there is this:  pkg-config --variable=completionsdir bash-completion
May 16 10:03:29 <carlwgeorge>	it's in epel-rpm-macros, and i thought the point was to have a unified macro to use everywhere.  but i may be confusing it with rpmmacrodir.
May 16 10:04:16 <Son_Goku>	I don't think we've ever had a bash completion dir macro
May 16 10:04:21 <Son_Goku>	some people define one in their spec
May 16 10:04:28 <Son_Goku>	but there isn't a global one
May 16 10:05:09 <carlwgeorge>	i wonder what the logic was of putting bash_completion_dir in epel-rpm-macros then
May 16 10:07:58 <tmz>	carlwgeorge: The commit message doesn't explain the reasoning, but perhaps tibbs remembers.

May 16 10:50:45 <carlwgeorge>	pepperidge farms remembers
May 16 11:15:58 <tmz>	Hah.
May 16 12:07:15 <tibbs>	tmz: Someone asked for it; I don't remember all of the context now.
May 16 12:16:05 <tibbs>	I think the idea was that it would be defined everywhere, but then it never made it into redhat-rpm-config.

May 16 14:17:11 <ajax>	handsome_pirate: looks like the patch had some minor "could you split this up a bit" kinds of comments, and then no follow-up from the sender
May 16 14:17:32 <ajax>	at least, that's for the freebsd one back in december, i assume dfly is close enough
May 16 14:18:35 <handsome_pirate>	ajax:  ty
May 16 14:27:37 <lsm5>	the libpod/podman project uses the wheel format for packaging python files, is that a good enough reason to use wheel in the rpm, or do I need to file an exception or something?
May 16 14:37:05 <tibbs>	lsm5: There is some discussion in https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PythonWheels
May 16 14:37:43 <tibbs>	But that could of course be outdated by now.
May 16 14:38:59 <tibbs>	We do have separate guidelines for eggs.  By the time someone writes some documentation on dealing with wheels, they will probably invent another completely different python packaging format.
May 16 14:44:59 <lsm5>	tibbs: yup, i'm coming here from the wiki page you mentioned, it does mention to use wheels if there's a good reason, .. so I meant to ask if "upstream does it, so i'll just use that" is a good reason? .. does this need to be brought to a larger audience?
May 16 14:48:44 <tibbs>	It probably needs to be discussed with people who understand both python wheels and Fedora's python packaging.

May 16 16:12:28 <Pharaoh_Atem>	yeah, it's an odd dichotomy
May 16 16:12:49 <Pharaoh_Atem>	ajax: but I was referring to the package changelog...
May 16 16:12:54 <Pharaoh_Atem>	not the upstream one
May 16 17:43:22 <adamw>	ajax: ahoy, around? since i upgraded my desktop to rawhide recently it seems i can freeze it quite easily just by browsing to a few different sites in firefox. seems to be a wayland issue - changing kernel back to an fc28 one didn't help, but running on X instead of wayland seems to be. does this sound like anything familiar or should i file a new bug?
May 16 17:45:56 <nirik>	adamw: I have the same thing here. I downgraded firefox
May 16 17:46:04 <adamw>	nirik: huh, hadn't thought of that. :P
May 16 17:46:18 <nirik>	firefox-60.0-1.fc29.x86_64 apparently uses a wayland backend, which got disabled in newer.
May 16 17:46:20 <adamw>	nirik: what graphics?
May 16 17:46:23 <nirik>	intel
May 16 17:47:12 <adamw>	i'm on nouveau, so it's not that
May 16 17:47:34 <adamw>	nirik: so you downgraded to something older than 60.0-0.5 ?
May 16 17:47:50 <nirik>	no, I downgraded to 60.0-1
May 16 17:47:53 <adamw>	even though the wayland backend that added is supposed to be disabled since 60.0-2 ?
May 16 17:47:58 <adamw>	huh
May 16 17:48:10 <adamw>	but then why wasn't it hanging on f28...
May 16 17:48:13 <adamw>	is there a bug report?
May 16 17:48:14 <mkrupcale>	adamw, could it be related to this? https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1514831
May 16 17:48:35 <adamw>	mkrupcale: no, i don't think so.
May 16 17:48:54 <nirik>	adamw: right, the wayland backend seems to make it work nicely here.
May 16 17:49:30 <adamw>	nirik: hum. well, presumably one could use a newer package and just...enable the wayland backend, however one does that.
May 16 17:50:19 <adamw>	oh, it's a build time thing.
May 16 17:50:41 <nirik>	yeah. ;(
May 16 17:51:03 <nirik>	if you file or find a bug I would like to subscribe to your newsletter. ;) Or I can file one if you want.
May 16 17:51:13 <adamw>	i'll file it then
May 16 17:51:20 <adamw>	need to pad out my activity report this week :P
May 16 17:51:25 <nirik>	heh.
May 16 17:51:37 *	nirik goes back to reinstalling armv7 builders with f27. ;( 
May 16 17:52:03 <adamw>	nirik: you're running on GNOME-on-Wayland presumably?
May 16 17:52:57 <nirik>	yeah
May 16 17:54:19 <nirik>	also here at least there's no logs or anything, the laptop locks up and needs power cycled.
May 16 17:57:15 <adamw>	nirik: same here. in my case it's not locked, though
May 16 17:57:21 <adamw>	i can ssh in and poke around from another box
May 16 17:57:30 <adamw>	but can never recover the graphical session, even by killing firefox
May 16 17:57:53 <nirik>	huh, I am not 100% sure it isusing the wayland backend...
May 16 17:58:04 <adamw>	it shouldn't be
May 16 17:58:16 <adamw>	oh, wait, you mean in your downgraded case?
May 16 17:58:28 <nirik>	MetaWindowXWayland
May 16 17:58:29 <nirik>	yeah
May 16 17:59:04 <adamw>	have you tried 60.0-2 or 60.0-3 ?
May 16 17:59:16 <adamw>	i wonder if it was "Firefox 60 build 2" that broke it...
May 16 17:59:37 <nirik>	not sure. I tried one of the newer ones...
May 16 18:00:16 <nirik>	I had -4 that was causing the issues.
May 16 18:00:22 <nirik>	I didn't try -2 or -3
May 16 18:01:14 <adamw>	right, -4 was "Updated to Firefox 60 build 2"
May 16 18:01:23 <adamw>	so i'm wondering if it's something in that "build 2" that's the problem...
May 16 18:10:42 <adamw>	nirik: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1579067
May 16 18:12:21 <nirik>	cool. I'll poke at it if I get time... https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1576593 has been the puzzler of the week for me.
May 16 18:32:43 <adamw>	nirik: fun :/
May 16 18:33:18 <adamw>	oh, -2 and -3 firefox builds didn't work, so -1 it is
May 16 18:34:07 <adamw>	hum, that 'build 2' apparently only involves langpacks. seems unlikely that'd be causing the freeze.
May 16 18:37:56 <nirik>	yeah, so its likely the wayland vs not wayland
May 16 18:42:37 <adamw>	nirik: i don't think it's that simple
May 16 18:43:04 <adamw>	it's got to also be a new bug in 60, or something
May 16 18:43:17 <adamw>	otherwise we'd have been seeing this in builds *before* the wayland backend was added at all..
May 16 18:43:29 *	adamw goes to do some triaging
May 16 18:44:03 <nirik>	I can dream...
May 16 19:45:35 <adamw>	nirik: something else is involved here too...
May 16 19:45:54 <adamw>	nirik: 59.0.2-1.fc28 on rawhide hits the bug, 60.0-4.fc28 on f28 doesn't
May 16 19:45:59 <adamw>	obvious suspect: Xwayland
May 16 19:47:47 <adamw>	which brings me back to ajax :P
May 16 19:47:52 *	adamw checks if downgrading xwayland helps
May 16 20:05:36 <adamw>	yup. it does.
May 16 21:27:08 <lorbus>	so DevConf.us accepted speakers confirmation has been dalayed til June 1.

May 17 11:08:55 <nirik>	fidencio: hey, you added 'ExcludeArch: armv7hl' to sssd... is there a bug or reason explaining why? this broke rawhide compose today because appliance-tools needs sssd, and we have release blocking armv7 appliacens...
May 17 11:08:58 <nirik>	appliances.
May 17 11:10:19 <nirik>	is it possibly because you were seeing random build failures on armv7 with 'bus error' and the like?
May 17 11:19:44 <fidencio>	nirik: hey!
May 17 11:20:11 <nirik>	I found your commit. Can you please revert that and do a new build?
May 17 11:20:16 <fidencio>	nirik: I can't build sssd on armv7hl. It fails when using koji but builds perfectly on a real hardware.
May 17 11:20:29 <nirik>	the armv7 issue is https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1576593
May 17 11:20:38 <nirik>	we moved all the builders back to f27 for now
May 17 11:20:48 <nirik>	so it should work fine for you now

May 17 11:54:13 <nirik>	thanks
May 17 11:57:05 <fidencio>	nirik: out of curiosity, all the packages were affected by this issue on armv7hl or SSSD was one of the few which were really lucky?
May 17 11:58:06 <geppetto>	ignatenkobrain: ok
May 17 11:58:15 <geppetto>	ignatenkobrain: not even for a few minutes?
May 17 12:00:23 <fedbot>	FPC meeting starting now in #fedora-meeting-1

Remember https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/graphviz/c/fac5862484f55f02e6102fa032e9c7cf6f4ecb93?branch=master ? mhroncock says it should not be a dynamic %version-%release but a static one, see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1574121#c1 Also could you backport this change to F28 too?
May 17 13:33:10 <tibbs>	eclipseo: Yes, obsoletes like that absolutely must have a hardcoded version-release.
May 17 13:33:51 <tibbs>	That package could return in the future, or someone could take the old package and rebuild it after incrementing the release.  Those must not be obsoleted.
May 17 13:34:15 <mhroncok>	lsm5: ping python wheels
May 17 13:36:47 <lsm5>	mhroncok: pong, upstream told me they went back to eggs, so I should be good on that front, unless you meant to ask something else
May 17 13:38:32 <mhroncok>	lsm5: I just wanted to know exactly what were you trying to accomplish with "packaging wheels"
May 17 13:39:10 <mhroncok>	lsm5: and wanted to let you know that if in fact you need to use wheels, than https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PythonWheels was just updated a bit to use the macros
May 17 13:40:10 <lsm5>	mhroncok: ah ok, well i hadn't wrapped my head around wheels (still haven't) ..but upstream mentioned wheels so it got me curious, since they went back to eggs, I struck it off my list
May 17 13:40:20 <lsm5>	mhroncok: but i'll keep this in mind for reference, thanks
May 17 13:41:20 <mhroncok>	lsm5: nevertheless this should usually have nothignt o do with rpm packagng at all
May 17 13:41:34 <mhroncok>	wheels are super easy and cool to install with pip

May 17 14:42:59 <pgier>	eclipseo, I have a question about the package name for soundcloud/go-runit: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1579403
May 17 14:43:23 <pgier>	eclipseo, it seems that the srpm macros are doing something weird here and removing the "-go" from the package name
May 17 14:43:53 <pgier>	eclipseo, I think due to this line: https://github.com/gofed/go-macros/blob/master/rpm/macros.d/macros.go-srpm#L48
May 17 14:46:10 <pgier>	eclipseo, so I guess my question is should I just manually specify the correct Name in the spec file?
May 17 14:47:03 <pgier>	currently the goipath is github.com/soundcloud/go-runit, but the resulting rpm filename is golang-github-soundcloud-runit
May 17 14:47:44 <eclipseo>	pgier: this is "normal", the writers of the new Go packaging have chosen to standardize package name by removing duplicates, go prefix, capital letters and so on. I actually reported a bug about that before: https://github.com/gofed/go-macros/issues/38#issuecomment-373008352
May 17 14:55:07 <pgier>	eclipseo, interesting, thanks for the pointer, makes more sense now
May 17 14:56:26 <pgier>	eclipseo, do you use a tool to generate the spec files? afaik gofed still generates in the older format, or maybe it's been updated?
May 17 15:07:36 <eclipseo>	pgier: what Fedora are you on? On F28 gofed generates the new format I think
May 17 15:08:05 <pgier>	I'm using F27
May 17 15:08:20 <eclipseo>	pgier: I'm currently using 0.18.rc1.fc28 fom updates-testing
May 17 15:12:02 <eclipseo>	pgier: I've look it up, there's a gofed in updates-testing for F27 that has not be pushed to stable
May 17 15:12:40 <eclipseo>	pgier: trx doirg dnf update gofed --enable-repo=updates-testing
May 17 15:12:48 <eclipseo>	*try doing
May 17 15:13:33 <pgier>	eclipseo, ok, thanks, I'll take a look, so far I've been writing a small cli app to generate the spec files for me
May 17 15:13:59 <pgier>	eclipseo, in the past the setup of gofed seemed kind of complicated
May 17 15:19:55 <eclipseo>	pgier: I never had to setup gofed? I just use sudo gofed repo2spec --detect github.com/t3rm1n4l/go-mega for example
May 17 15:23:03 <pgier>	eclipseo, I think previously I first tried installing with dnf, but that one was out of date, so then I followed the quickstart instructions https://github.com/gofed/gofed#quick-start
May 17 15:26:02 <bowlofeggs>	bodhi-3.8.0b0 is running in staging: https://bodhi.stg.fedoraproject.org/docs/user/release_notes.html
May 17 15:27:31 <eclipseo>	pgier: this seems to be if you haven't already installed gofed

May 17 19:28:23 <tibbs>	I'm trying to find the official mention of the F26 EOL date (which I assume is June 1) but I can't seem to find it.
May 17 19:29:59 <tibbs>	It's not on any of the schedule pages (not https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/26/Schedule, nor the pages for F27, F28 or F29).
May 17 19:31:24 <tibbs>	It's not mentioned at all on https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases.  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Life_Cycle of course says F28 release date "plus one month" but I don't see that the date is actually written down anywhere.
May 17 20:33:54 <nirik>	tibbs: it's 2018-05-29... https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/f-28/f-28-all-tasks.html
May 17 20:51:25 <tibbs>	nirik: Ah, thanks.  Interesting that "one month" isn't really a month.
May 17 20:51:48 <nirik>	yeah it really is the tuesday nearest one month I think...
May 17 20:52:27 <tibbs>	Might as well just say "four weeks", then.
May 17 23:14:05 <wadadli>	in a bit of a pickle, seems like the latest updates in stable for NetworkManager broke wifi on my device
May 17 23:15:19 <wadadli>	dnf downgrade NetworkManager errors out about opening file for checksum
May 17 23:15:49 <wadadli>	is there some way to tell dnf to skip checksums in this case?
May 17 23:15:58 <wadadli>	and just grab the old packages from cache?
May 17 23:16:29 <wadadli>	I've tried dnf downgrade NetworkManager --cacheonly
May 17 23:16:37 <wadadli>	dnf histroy undo <lastest transaction>
May 17 23:16:45 <wadadli>	dnf history rollback NetworkManager
May 18 02:02:56 <juhp>	Is there tool that orders packages in build dependency order?
May 18 02:03:49 <juhp>	adamw: langpacks!! 8-)
May 18 02:04:58 <juhp>	?
May 18 02:07:18 <juhp>	ah just upstream langpacks
May 18 02:07:29 <juhp>	adamw: ignore me
May 18 04:29:41 <dwmw2_gone>	Subject:	Automated chime copr build of pidgin-chime-1.0.git.6.d2829bf-0.fc27 for epel-7-ppc64le finished with 'success'
May 18 04:30:06 <dwmw2_gone>	What are the chances of the word 'success' ever actually being *shown* and not falling off the right-hand-side of the message index?
May 18 08:04:16 <juhp>	juhp: well I wrote one anyway...
May 18 09:29:03 <nb>	anyone around?
May 18 09:29:13 <nb>	can someone look at https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/znc/blob/master/f/znc.spec and see why it is depending on znc-modperl?
May 18 09:29:33 <nb>	znc-modperl should be an optional subpackage, but in f28 it is pulling it in when you dnf install znc
May 18 10:02:21 <sgallagh>	zbyszek: I have a conflict today for FESCo, so I've voted in the tickets.
May 18 10:05:31 <tmz>	nb: It looks like you have %{_libdir}/znc/* in the main package, which includes %{_libdir}/znc/modperl (as well as modpython, modtcl, perlval.pm, pyeval.py, etc.
May 18 10:08:36 <nb>	tmz, ooooh
May 18 10:08:44 <nb>	tmz, thanks
May 18 10:09:28 <tmz>	I guess you either go back to listing every module in znc or add some excludes for the subpackages, depending on which way is clearer.
May 18 10:44:18 <bowlofeggs>	zbyszek: i will miss the first 15-20 min of the fesco meeting - sorry :(
May 18 10:59:31 <zbyszek>	maxamillion dgilmore nirik jsmith tyll jwb: fesco meeting in 1
May 18 10:59:59 <dgilmore>	zbyszek: cheers
May 18 11:51:49 <carlwgeorge>	eclipseo: would you mind creating an override for https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-1f07467298, i think the lack of it is causing build failures for me
May 18 11:52:17 <carlwgeorge>	you had one for the first build, but not for the next one that obsoleted it
May 18 12:06:07 <eclipseo>	carlwgeorge: the override is now active
May 18 12:06:46 <carlwgeorge>	thanks!
May 18 12:44:15 <tibbs>	Does anyone have a pointer to the latest official announcement about what's happening to python2 support in Fedora?
May 18 12:45:32 <TingPing>	tibbs, i thought there was only a mailinglist discussion?
May 18 12:46:33 <tibbs>	Well, there's https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FinalizingFedoraSwitchtoPython3 but that's more of a technical document as opposed to an explanation to which I can point people who ask.
May 18 12:49:15 <tyll>	zbyszek: will you update the FTBFS wiki page and ping me, then I will take a look, too?
May 18 13:23:11 <Caterpillar>	In past we used to have user permissions administration also at a level of single branches of each package. Now in a foo package setting page, you can only add people to the all packages branches, not a single one. I would like to add a user on master only
May 18 13:29:27 <eclipseo>	Caterpillar: not possible anymore as far as I know
May 18 13:34:33 <Caterpillar>	eclipseo: yeah
May 18 13:59:00 <tibbs>	Caterpillar: It is simply not possible; there was a big discussion about it.
May 18 13:59:19 <Caterpillar>	okay :-(
May 18 13:59:22 <tibbs>	If you don't trust someone to commit on one of the branches, you probably shouldn't trust them to commit at all.
May 18 14:01:04 <tibbs>	If you ask them not to commit to a release branch, surely you will know if they violate your trust.  It's git, so you can trivially revert.  And it would take some time before they could commit a change, get it built, generate an update, and get that updated pushed.  Certainly you would notice before that happened.
May 18 14:06:43 <Caterpillar>	tibbs: it is not a matter of trust, it is a matter of new candidate that is still not expert so it could break something (I am the sponsor).  I will add him telling him to doing pull request for this initial period of work on the package
May 18 14:06:54 <Caterpillar>	then I will tell him to push to master
May 18 14:08:09 <tibbs>	But it is a matter of trust.
May 18 14:08:25 <tibbs>	You ask him not to push to release branches and trust him not to do so.
May 18 14:08:44 <grift>	"It is simply not possible" is a first in this industry. I am used to the "there is a technical solution to all world problems" attitude
May 18 14:09:20 <tibbs>	grift: Context is important; you have missed it.
May 18 14:09:21 <ajax>	it's true, there is.
May 18 14:09:33 <ajax>	if we blow up the planet, there will be no more world on which to have problems.
May 18 14:09:45 <ajax>	technically this counts as a solution
May 18 14:11:03 <Caterpillar>	ping, skynet
May 18 14:11:16 <DrNick>	that seems expensive; what if we just slowly heated the planet until life becomes impossible
May 18 14:11:16 <tibbs>	Do I really have to qualify "it isn't possible" in every case "without someone getting down to the code and adding that functionality"?
May 18 14:12:10 <tibbs>	"It isn't possible given the current pagure interface and methods it uses to generate the git repository ACLs."  Is that better?
May 18 14:12:45 <grift>	ahh so its just an excuse
May 18 14:13:08 <tibbs>	Wow, really?
May 18 14:13:23 <tibbs>	Are you intending to come off as being incredibly insulting, or am I misreading you?
May 18 14:14:10 <grift>	not intending to be insulting, but you might not be misreading it either
May 18 14:15:28 <tibbs>	I'm not making excuses for anyone.  Someone asked a question and I answered it.  I didn't author the system in question so I don't know what else you could want from me.
May 18 14:16:10 <grift>	sure and its appreciated
May 18 14:17:36 <tibbs>	Then perhaps try being nice in return.
May 18 14:20:04 <tomhughes>	way to go with the helpful error messages fdpkg
May 18 14:23:00 <tomhughes>	of course I should have guess that fedpkg stores it's config in a directory called rpkg!
May 18 14:23:25 <gms>	going though https://getfedora.org/verify I'm wondering why the ISO images aren't directly signed with GPG - doing so would save one step (i.e. the sha256sum call) in the verification procedure
May 18 14:33:59 <rdieter>	gms: is that even possible?
May 18 14:34:36 <gms>	rdieter: yes, e.g. gpg -a --detach-sign Fedora-Workstation-netinst-x86_64-28-1.1.iso
May 18 14:35:04 <rdieter>	gms: and how long does that take compared to sha256sum ?
May 18 14:36:33 <rdieter>	(I suspect it's more, possibly much more)
May 18 14:37:58 <gms>	rdieter, it's 2.3 s vs. 1.8 s total time
May 18 14:38:16 <gms>	on an i7 cpu
May 18 14:38:41 <tomhughes>	it should't be much different really - all gpg will do is compute a hash and then sign that hash
May 18 15:21:08 <nirik>	adamw: did you get anywhere on the firefox / xorg-x11-server 1.20 lockups?
May 18 15:21:33 <adamw>	nirik: nothing further than when i filed the bug
May 18 15:21:39 <adamw>	i was kinda waiting for ajax or someone to poke back
May 18 15:21:43 <ajax>	remind me which bug number that was?
May 18 15:21:44 <nirik>	ok
May 18 15:21:52 <adamw>	ooo, a wild ajax appeared!
May 18 15:22:06 <adamw>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1579067
May 18 15:22:19 <adamw>	nirik: i spent all my 'weird bug' time yesterday on https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/issues/386 ...
May 18 15:22:37 *	adamw has been trying to get back to 'fix dnf' on his todo list for two weeks now and it just ain't happening
May 18 15:23:34 <nirik>	neat. I spent my time on the armv7 vm's pause or bus error. That one also is not yet solved. We just aren't batting to high this week. ;)
May 18 15:24:42 *	adamw resumes yak farm search
May 18 15:25:16 <ajax>	adamw, nirik: if you have an f28 machine, and you do 'dnf copr enable ajax/upstream && dnf upgrade', do you see this there too?
May 18 15:25:33 <ajax>	i would imagine the answer to be yes, but i've not seen this myself and that's what i'm running, so...
May 18 15:25:35 <nirik>	hey, I'm building a house in a somewhat rural area... I bet I could get a few yaks.
May 18 15:25:57 *	nirik is on rawhide
May 18 15:26:06 *	adamw on rawhide too
May 18 15:26:37 <ajax>	which gpus?
May 18 15:27:01 <nirik>	Intel Corporation UHD Graphics 620
May 18 15:27:31 <adamw>	nvidia geforce 9600 gtr
May 18 15:27:34 <adamw>	gt*
May 18 15:27:49 <adamw>	none of the commits after the 1.20.0 tag looked *remotely* relevant so i didn't figure git master would help...
May 18 15:27:58 <ajax>	yeah, i wouldn't imagine.
May 18 15:28:44 *	nirik has to run out for a bit, back later. 
May 18 15:28:51 <adamw>	i mean, if you don't have any better ideas for figuring it out i can just go back and bisect as best i can between 1.19 and 1.20rc3
May 18 15:28:58 <adamw>	i was just hoping you'd have a better idea to save time :P
May 18 15:29:21 <ajax>	the problem is the bisection is going to point you to a big "turn this feature on" commit
May 18 15:30:03 <ajax>	and like... yeah, i knew that part.
May 18 15:42:24 <ajax>	adamw: i'll poke at it a bit. if i come up with anything i'll probably ask you to try a build from that copr.
May 18 15:42:42 <adamw>	ajax: roger, thanks
May 18 15:43:15 <adamw>	ajax: so you're running git master xwayland, with GNOME on Wayland, and Firefox isn't doing this for you ?
May 18 15:44:17 <ajax>	at the _moment_ i'm in an Xorg session. but i switch fairly regularly.
May 18 15:53:34 <jsmith>	adamw: For what it's worth, I'm seeing lockups in Firefox as well in Rawhide, but I think I'm running Wayland ATM.
May 18 16:06:05 <adamw>	jsmith: yes, nirik and i see the hangs on wayland but not on Xorg
May 18 16:06:24 <adamw>	jsmith: they also go away if you downgrade xorg-x11-server and related packages to 1.19. at least they do for me.
May 18 16:06:33 <adamw>	this is the bug we're trying to get ajax to fix. :P
May 18 16:07:01 <jsmith>	OK, good to know I'm not entirely crazy, and that there are suitable workarounds :-)
May 18 16:07:32 <ajax>	just when i think i'm out...
May 18 16:08:46 <jsmith>	ajax: First time I remember bothering you about a video issue was when my daughter was born.... and she just turned 16 :-)
May 18 16:09:09 <jsmith>	ajax: At this rate, you'll never escape :-)
May 18 16:11:44 <ajax>	oof. my first commit to xserver was almost 14 years ago.
May 18 16:12:06 <ajax>	your math might be a little fuzzy, but not much.
May 18 16:18:29 <adamw>	ajax: hey, i've been doing this damn job for nearly ten years now
May 18 16:18:40 <adamw>	just think how many times you must have thought 'oh god what problem does adam have NOW'
May 18 16:18:46 <adamw>	(either of us)
May 18 16:19:46 <tibbs>	I have you all beat, and I know I'm not the oldest one around.
May 18 16:19:59 <adamw>	but you don't work on fedora. :P
May 18 16:20:04 <tibbs>	<Insert lawn evacuation order here>
May 18 16:20:17 <tibbs>	You must mean "get paid to work on Fedora".
May 18 16:20:32 <tibbs>	Or maybe "get paid by Red Hat to work on Fedora".
May 18 16:22:54 <Pharaoh_Atem>	heh
May 18 16:23:04 <Pharaoh_Atem>	getting paid to work on Fedora is a rare thing :)
May 18 16:24:52 <tibbs>	There are all sorts of ways to get paid.
May 18 16:25:38 *	adamw was kidding, but never mind
May 18 16:25:43 <tibbs>	Was offered a "friends and family"allotment of the Red Hat IPO but passed.  Didn't make that mistake again when VA Linux offered me the same.
May 18 16:26:30 <tibbs>	Worked out well enough in the end, I think, since I wasn't dumb enough to hold it more than a few hours.
May 18 16:27:05 <tibbs>	I think that's still the most ballistic IPO of all time.
May 18 17:26:56 <tibbs>	Ugh; what's the point of filing a bodhi comment with 0 karma and no content?
May 18 18:02:03 <robatino>	tibbs: getting email notifications. bodhi provides no way to do that without a comment
May 18 18:04:19 <robatino>	i wish there was one. i've made a few blank comments for just that reason. i try to do it early, before there are a lot of comments
May 18 18:07:17 <misc>	wouldn't fedmsg do that ?
May 18 18:08:45 <robatino>	is there a way to get emails for a specific update without posting a comment on it? that's what i'm interested in
May 18 18:10:23 <tibbs>	Seems that if you're going through the trouble, you could at least do some testing.
May 18 18:10:26 <robatino>	say i wanted to get an email anytime some posts a comment on https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-538a7a0e36 (for example), but without posting a comment myself
May 18 18:10:37 <robatino>	s/some/someone
May 18 18:11:57 <robatino>	i might not be in a position to do testing on the update, but want to follow its progress
May 18 18:26:38 <robatino>	basically the same as subscribing to a thread in a discussion forum, without posting a comment in it. that ability is pretty standard
May 18 19:46:36 <tibbs>	Ugh, I forgot about the authconfig->authselect migration.
May 18 19:47:07 <tibbs>	Sadly the compatibility stuff generates an invalid kerberos configuration.
May 18 20:43:15 <Son_Goku>	I wonder if we have an equivalent to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1 ?
May 18 20:43:31 <Son_Goku>	it's kind of silly, but I kind of hoped that we did... :/
May 18 20:48:57 <tibbs>	RHBZ is all business.
May 18 20:49:41 <tibbs>	But Red Hat predates RHBZ, and of course Fedora didn't come along until later still.
May 18 20:50:00 <tibbs>	So I suspect the joke was there in some point, in some system that no longer exists.
May 18 20:50:20 <tibbs>	Then again, bug #1 is private, so....
May 18 20:53:04 <tibbs>	It's funny to see how the early bugs are hit by various random scripts and typos.
May 18 20:55:06 <tibbs>	And smooge filed bug #3.  Alan Cox filed #4.  Only 20 years ago.
May 18 21:33:42 <nirik>	amusingly, bug 1 is a test bug with tons of random people using it for testing and others telling them to use partner-bugzilla. ;) Not too exciting
May 18 21:37:26 <juhp>	f26 is not mentioned on https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases
May 18 21:40:24 <nirik>	perhaps it was all a dream. ;)
May 18 21:53:00 <Son_Goku>	nirik: heh
May 18 21:53:50 <Son_Goku>	wow, Alan Cox had a weird looking email address
May 18 21:54:27 <Son_Goku>	also, IBM Bug Proxy is hilarious :D
May 18 21:55:25 <Son_Goku>	and bug 8 was randomly associated with docker :D
May 18 21:55:34 <Son_Goku>	err bug 6

May 18 22:40:57 <juhp>	okay nirik must be right, lol
May 18 22:41:17 <juhp>	anyway I assume next month
May 18 22:43:21 <daMaestro>	@f25eol
May 18 22:43:21 <fedbot>	Fedora 25 went end of life and no longer supported on 2017-12-12 which was 22 weeks, 2 days, 19 hours, 43 minutes, and 21 seconds ago
May 18 22:43:24 <daMaestro>	@f26eol
May 18 22:43:25 <fedbot>	Fedora 26 will go end of life and no longer supporterd one month after fedora 28 is released (sometime around may 2018), so around june 2018
May 18 22:43:35 <juhp>	thanks

May 18 22:48:55 <tmz>	juhp: https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/f-28/f-28-all-tasks.html puts the f26 eol as 5/29.
May 18 22:49:42 <juhp>	aha thanks sounds too soon - I guess it should be 1 June or a little after that
May 18 22:49:54 <tmz>	Maybe someone with admin access to fedbot can teach it that date, so as the question is asked more often the answer is close at hand. :)
May 18 22:50:13 <juhp>	anyway I am not particularly worried :)  I was more pondering if I can delete my vm already or not ;-)
May 18 22:50:27 <tmz>	I think it was as close to 4 weeks after f28 that was picked.  I forget who was saying that, I think in this channel.
May 18 22:50:43 <juhp>	tmz: yeah I was trying to work out which plugin...
May 18 22:50:53 <nirik>	daMaestro: thanks. ;)

May 18 22:51:55 <tmz>	juhp: Yeah, that's what I always thought too.  Call it on February I guess. :)

May 18 22:53:22 <juhp>	so just 10 days away.... might be good to make an announcement too
May 18 22:53:37 <juhp>	or did I miss it?
May 18 22:54:19 <tmz>	I don't think anything went out.  Though perhaps it went out on 5/3 if the schedule was used.  If so, it was 2 weeks or so ago and I've forgotten already.
May 18 22:55:02 <juhp>	I couldn't find any announcement though I didn't look very hard
May 18 22:58:36 <tmz>	Looking at my fedora-announce list archives, I don't see announcement for previous releases until the day they are EOL.  I thought there had been announcements of the impending EOL's, but maybe I'm dreaming.
May 18 22:59:25 <tmz>	And thanks for updating fedbot nirik. :)

May 19 11:10:20 <RaphGro>	ignatenkobrain: please read about I3 with gpgme, is there any upstream bug about this? ^
May 19 11:36:09 <rdieter>	is fedpkg-1.33 working for anyone else?  most feedback on https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-02a72376d5 is negative, but is submitted for batched despite that.
May 19 11:38:05 <rdieter>	(if it's not working for anyone else and there are no objections, I may edit it to stop it going stable)
May 19 11:40:34 <tmz>	I think for critical packages the default of +3 karma is too low.  I tend to disabled autopush on most of my updates because there's often a lot of quick +1's which I know can't have tested many features.
May 19 11:41:19 <tmz>	(I know fedpkg isn't critpath, but it's fairly important for packagers, obviously.)
May 19 11:41:33 <tomhughes>	hmm so bodhi disabled autopush but didn't revoke the autopush that had already happened...
May 19 11:46:39 <tmz>	rdieter: Stopping the update seems sensible to me.  It's broken in the same way for me as it is for you and others.
May 19 11:49:43 <rdieter>	unfortunatel, I don't think recent bodhi versions have any simple "undo request to batched/stable" as far as I can tell.  The closest thing I've found so far is "unpush + requeue to -testing"
May 19 11:51:41 <rdieter>	(and thanks for all the quick feedback and extra testing so far)
May 19 11:52:49 <tmz>	I mistakenly added +1 instead of -1.  Nothing like a comment saying it doesn't work along with a +1. :/
May 19 11:53:10 <tmz>	Thanks for stopping it from getting to stable rdieter.
May 19 11:53:17 <tmz>	rdieter++
May 19 11:53:18 <zodbot>	tmz: Karma for rdieter changed to 2 (for the f28 release cycle):  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/tags/cookie/any
May 19 11:53:27 <rdieter>	tmz: ha
May 19 11:56:23 <AquaL1te>	hi, short question. when i build my srpm and sign it with my key (the gpg key which is also defined in my fas account) is there a check done by bodhi/koji that verifies this signature? or is signing by the package dev not really used?
May 19 11:57:23 <bowlofeggs>	AquaL1te: koji doesn't allow you to upload srpms to build
May 19 11:57:24 <rdieter>	AquaL1te: dnf checks
May 19 12:03:03 <tmz>	And the signatures dnf checks are made with the distribution signing keys.  Your local keys don't come into play at all there.
May 19 12:04:10 <tibbs>	Sadly the question itself doesn't make a lot of sense, so the answers vary.
May 19 12:04:34 <tibbs>	You can upload an srpm (and it can be signed, I guess) but you can only do a scratch build with it.
May 19 12:05:00 <tibbs>	Koji doesn't check any existing signature before it does a scratch build.
May 19 12:05:29 <tibbs>	The only builds which can get composed into the actual repositories are builds done from git.
May 19 12:07:23 <tibbs>	If you want to take some built packages from pretty much anywhere, sign them, put them in a local repository, and configure dnf to use that repository, then dnf would check the signatures unless configured not to do so.
May 19 12:09:03 <tibbs>	You still have to configure the location of the key as part of the repository definition (with the gpgkey directive).
May 19 12:24:00 <AquaL1te>	tibbs: okay, so signing the srpm's doesn't trigger any signature checks. i was expecting such a thing by the way, it does verify to a broader extent that the owner of the package sent it and during transit it wasn't altered.
May 19 12:26:48 <tmz>	AquaL1te: For any builds which will be distributed, the verification is done via kerberos when the packager pushes the changes to the git repo.  Then koji pulls and builds from git.
May 19 12:27:29 <tmz>	The tarballs that are uploaded are hashed with sha512 and pushed to a separate location, which is used to generate the srpm during tyhe koji build.
May 19 12:27:54 <tmz>	That upload is also verified using the packager's FAS credentials.
May 19 12:32:58 <AquaL1te>	tmz: i'm not putting that part in question, that seems very legit. although kerberos only creates a session ticket right? it doesn't create a signature. i'll check a bit further, just out of curiosity.
May 19 12:34:08 <AquaL1te>	and a check seems to be possible without much hassle, since a dev already has the gpg public key linked to his/her fas account. just my paranoid thoughts here, that's all :)
May 19 12:34:31 <tmz>	AquaL1te: You don't buy much, if anything with that.
May 19 12:35:18 <tmz>	If the account of the user pushing the update is compromised to the point that the kerberos ticket can be stolen/abused, then a gpg signature isn't trustworthy either.
May 19 12:36:12 <AquaL1te>	tmz: true, i'll have more in depth look at kerberos
May 19 12:36:24 <AquaL1te>	thanks for you feedback!
May 19 12:37:14 <tibbs>	I guess I just don't understand why you keep asking about signing srpms, since you don't send an srpm to do a real build.
May 19 12:37:33 <tibbs>	Where would you even get an opportunity to sign any srpm anywhere in the process?
May 19 12:37:55 <tmz>	Perhaps you're coming from a debian maintainer background AquaL1te?
May 19 12:43:01 <AquaL1te>	tibbs: yeah sorry to mention srpms, those are indeed not sent. fedpkg is used (which version controls a spec file), yeah i'm mixing things up here.
May 19 12:45:10 <tibbs>	fedpkg is just a convenience wrapper around a few things.

May 20 12:42:03 <superboum>	Hi, I'm developping a small game with mono+monodevelop on my free time. I am a bit surprised that mono and monodevelop versions shipped on fedora are so old. It appears that the progress of the new version of both packages is tracked on bugzilla (RHBZ 1313236 and RHBZ 1436896). It appears that maintainer enocountered some difficulties, but they don't look so active. Do you have more information on this topic?
May 20 12:45:42 <superboum>	*issues don't look so active, not maintainers, and I might miss some information exchanged on other channels. I don't want to criticize people work, excuse me if it sounded like that in my previous message.
May 20 12:48:46 <Son_Goku>	superboum, most of that work goes on with the .NET SIG
May 20 12:48:52 <Son_Goku>	superboum, they hang out in #fedora-dotnet
May 20 12:50:08 <superboum>	Ok, thank you very much for the pointer

May 21 06:22:06 <AquaL1te>	i have a question about how mirrors sync with each other. is it true that mirrors can use e.g. rsyncd for that? this is unencrypted and doesn't have for example ssh fingerprints. in theory this allows spoofing the address and allows the mirror to sync with (for fun) an ubuntu mirror. is this brain fart correct, or am i missing a detail here. of course mirrormanager crawls the content of a mirror
May 21 06:22:12 <AquaL1te>	from time to time and there is signature checking done. but clients are encouraged to use https to prevent mitm, so why don't the mirrors themselves follow the same practice?
May 21 06:34:27 <FranciscoD>	AquaL1te: probably a topic for #fedora-admin where the infra folks hang out
May 21 06:36:29 <AquaL1te>	FranciscoD: will do, thanks
May 21 07:31:49 <tomhughes>	AquaL1te: if clients follow the verification chain correctly a mirror with incorrect data is no thread - the metalink response (which comes from fedora directly over https) has checksums for the repomd.xml so a mirror that serves an incorrect repomd.xml is ignored
May 21 07:32:01 <tomhughes>	and repomd then has checksums for the other files
May 21 07:32:07 <tomhughes>	s/thread/threat/
May 21 07:34:06 <tomhughes>	and metalink will stop reporting the mirror altogether if it's repomd.xml doesn't match one of the last couple produced I believe
May 21 08:46:48 <jcline>	ignatenkobrain, when you have a chance can you bump https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/python-canonicaljson to 1.1.3 in rawhide and at least f28? 1.0.0->1.1.3 looks backwards-compatible for the changelog and I didn't notice matrix-synapse needs the newer one
May 21 09:23:33 <jwb>	bexelbie, mattdm: is flocktofedora.org going to be updated soon?  i was looking at flights to dresden and they are... expensive.
May 21 10:31:47 <bexelbie>	jwb, consider Berlin or Prague - I'm working on the alternate flight destination details
May 21 10:32:01 <bexelbie>	Prague, in particular, features a beautiful train ride
May 21 10:35:46 <jwb>	bexelbie, how long is the ride?
May 21 10:36:55 <bexelbie>	generally, 2-3 hours depending on the exact transit routing selected
May 21 10:37:08 <bexelbie>	trending closer to 2-2.5 for ones I'd recommend
May 21 10:37:14 <bexelbie>	for both cities, iirc
May 21 11:08:39 <AquaL1te>	 tomhughes: thanks, that info about the metalink really helps understanding the security chain. i got a similar response from fedora-admin
May 21 14:47:16 <radez>	torsava: ping, there are two repos for python-cherrypy and python3-cherrypy, I'm working on bringing the py2 version up to match the python3 version, would you be willing to merge these two repos back together and keep the py2 and 3 packages at the same version?
May 21 14:47:42 <radez>	I also plan to try and add the new deps for bringing them up the latest release eventually
May 21 14:50:15 <torsava>	radez, How about I add you as a maintainer of python3-cherrypy? :)

May 21 15:19:29 <wdna>	hey, I have question, when Cmake 3.12 is expected to be avaliable on fedora 28 ?
May 21 15:22:10 <ajax>	it's not even in rawhide yet.
May 21 15:22:19 <orionp>	wdna: fairly soon after it's released I would expect.
May 21 15:24:28 <wdna>	it has some features that are much needed... not too much of an issue. hwoever it seems stable?
May 21 15:26:02 <wdna>	oh, maybe I'm wrong and it's not? oh well.
May 21 16:33:04 <tibbs>	If I'm using %autosetup -S git so that my patches all get applied in separate git commits, what's the best way to go in and regenerate/modify one of the applied patches?
May 21 16:34:16 <tibbs>	I guess I can checkout the commit where the patch was applied, make my changes, and then git diff from the previous commit.
May 21 16:42:40 <ajax>	tibbs: cd into directory, edit, git commit -a, git rebase -i (uh, something, earliest commit in the history i guess), move your new patch to be a fixup after the one it fixes, git format-patch -1 (sha1)
May 21 16:42:54 <ajax>	is what i usually do anyway

May 22 05:50:30 <wtay>	rdieter: do you have a moment? there is something wrong with the script to extract the plugins from the packages after they build and now the Provides of the RPM doesn't contain the right info
May 22 05:50:59 <wtay>	rdieter, I have no idea how or where the script is triggered
May 22 07:19:39 <peter_lemenkov>	mlichvar: sure go on, I don't mind if anyone plays with any of packages I'm maintaining currently. And I strongly object the concept of "package owning". So please step in if you like - I can only appreciate this.
May 22 08:34:48 <jwendell>	hi folks! Is there a way to pass '--define' (to override a .spec variable like in rpmbuild) to fedpkg/rhpkg?
May 22 08:55:33 <rdieter>	wtay: pong, I can help now if you still want.  what's the context here?  gstreamer plugins?
May 22 09:15:05 <rdieter>	wtay: I think I see it, installing updates-testing today,  Problem 1: package libreoffice-gtk3-1:6.0.3.2-10.fc28.x86_64 requires gstreamer1(element-gtksink)()(64bit), but none of the providers can be installed
May 22 09:16:19 <rdieter>	wtay: what's supposed to handle that is /usr/lib/rpm/gstreamer1.prov , provided by gstreamer1
May 22 09:19:37 <rdieter>	I'll try to take a closer look here shortly
May 22 09:23:12 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: ping, hi, I put in a PR for python-pexpect yesterday, is that something that you'd be willing to review to revive the el7 branch if I maintain it?
May 22 09:24:08 <ignatenkobrain>	radez: can't you just merge it yourself?
May 22 09:24:21 <ignatenkobrain>	I really don't want to look at that outdated (el*) stuff
May 22 09:25:02 <radez>	I would have to be a maintainer to merge it wouldn't I?

May 22 11:22:02 <eclipseo>	ok thx
May 22 11:31:50 <mzabaluev>	pavlix: Hi. Do you maintain the strongswan packages?
May 22 11:41:55 <mzabaluev>	I'd like to try my hand at maintenance of those. The situation does not look very dynamic, with unfixed CVEs and all: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&classification=Fedora&component=strongswan&component=NetworkManager-strongswan&list_id=8864822&product=Fedora&query_format=advanced
May 22 11:58:52 <tibbs>	mzabaluev: I see you have even submitted a pull request.  Thanks for doing that.  Note that there is another maintainer for that package, and interestingly enough it has been touched by provenpackagers more than the listed maintainers.
May 22 12:01:07 <tibbs>	So you might try directly emailing strongswan-owner@fedoraproject.org to reach both maintainers directly.
May 22 12:02:19 <tibbs>	You might also contact pwouters or lkundrak since they have updated the package recently.
May 22 12:02:48 <tibbs>	They're both in this channel (as LetoTo and lubko).
May 22 12:05:30 <mzabaluev>	tibbs: Thank you, will do
May 22 12:12:49 <tibbs>	Hmm, why is dnf-yum still part of the base install?
May 22 12:16:46 <tibbs>	Technically it's a mandatory member of the "core" group.
May 22 12:44:10 <jwb>	tibbs, why shouldn't it be?
May 22 12:59:31 <tibbs>	What, why shouldn't yum-dnf be in the core group?  Because it's unnecessary?
May 22 13:02:20 <tibbs>	Sure, it's easy enough to exclude it.  I'm just surprised that I have to, in a release where we don't even include cron by default.
May 22 13:04:51 <jwb>	tibbs, hm.  i missed your follow up of it being in the core group.  that's different than being in the base install
May 22 13:05:03 <jwb>	tibbs, anyway, i think there's a lot of cleanup to do overall with our groups
May 22 13:12:19 <tibbs>	I think there are various different meanings of "base" as well.  There's %packages -nobase, and "base-system" and critical-path-base.
May 22 13:47:49 <yetoo>	.spec files define the rules for package installation correct?
May 22 13:48:09 <tibbs>	Maybe?
May 22 13:48:18 <tibbs>	Depends on what you mean by "rules for package installation".
May 22 13:49:02 <yetoo>	Like how does the rpm repository standard work for say a rpm file that isn't in the repository
May 22 13:49:18 <tibbs>	The spec file indicates which files will be contained in the package, as well as actions (in the form of scripts) which will run at package installation and removal time.
May 22 13:49:44 <tibbs>	If you just take an rpm file and do "rpm -i foo.rpm" then it will be installed (assuming there aren't dependency issues or the like).
May 22 13:50:08 <yetoo>	.spec files define actions for upgrading as well?
May 22 13:50:40 <tibbs>	Well, upgrading is just an installation.
May 22 13:51:06 <yetoo>	alright
May 22 13:51:22 <tibbs>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Scriptlets#Ordering shows how the various scriptlets are run.
May 22 13:51:35 <tibbs>	Doesn't include file triggers, though.  Honestly I don't know when those get run.
May 22 13:52:35 <yetoo>	So are they located in a rpm package? Because when I looked they aren't there.
May 22 13:53:01 <tibbs>	The scriptlets which are run?  Yes, they're in there.  rpm -qp --scriptlets foo.rpm
May 22 13:53:13 <tibbs>	Not all packages have them, of course.  We're working to get rid of them.
May 22 13:54:09 <tibbs>	Sorry, rpm -qp --scripts
May 22 13:54:52 <tibbs>	For example, here's a package in the F28 release: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/cZkHuIlm5Ll6DD-Un8g88w
May 22 13:55:17 <tibbs>	Shows the %pre and %post and %postun scriptlets that the package has.
May 22 13:56:06 <tibbs>	And here's the specfile, at the point where those three scripts are defined: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/cyrus-imapd/blob/master/f/cyrus-imapd.spec#_517
May 22 13:56:37 <yetoo>	So how are the install procedures defined implicitly (without the spec file)?
May 22 13:56:55 <tibbs>	I don't understand what you are asking.
May 22 13:57:34 <yetoo>	You said that the team was working on getting rid of scriptlets
May 22 13:58:00 <tibbs>	Yes, there is a general push towards simply not needing them.
May 22 13:58:04 <yetoo>	so how does it work without scriptlets
May 22 13:58:09 <tibbs>	How does what work?
May 22 13:58:26 <yetoo>	installation of a package
May 22 13:58:33 <otaylor>	yetoo: Sometimes, you can just engineer the system so you don't need scriptlets.
May 22 13:58:56 <tibbs>	Installation of a package involves putting the files in the right place, with the right permissions and selinux contexts and whatnot.
May 22 13:59:01 <otaylor>	yetoo: Without scriplets, the files still get put into place when the package is installed - and that's the *main* thing you want
May 22 13:59:29 <tibbs>	Most packages simply don't need any other actions to take place.  The files are put in place and everything is done.
May 22 13:59:30 <otaylor>	yetoo: in other cases, scriplets have been replaced with file triggers - http://rpm.org/user_doc/file_triggers.html - so the same thing doesn't need to be repeated in every package
May 22 14:00:32 <LetoTo>	unfixed CVEs?
May 22 14:00:38 <yetoo>	I'm trying to solve an issue with the glib2-devel package as it is having conflicts with the i686 and x86_64 architectures regarding conflicting files and there are no .spec files in each of the rpm
May 22 14:00:43 <tibbs>	LetoTo: Context?
May 22 14:01:01 <LetoTo>	checking my backlog now on those strongswan items
May 22 14:01:07 <tibbs>	The spec files are never in the binary RPMs.
May 22 14:01:32 <tibbs>	The glib2 specfile is at https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/glib2/blob/master/f/glib2.spec if you just want to peruse it.
May 22 14:01:53 <yetoo>	i forgot about dnf download --source
May 22 14:02:25 <tibbs>	The package has no scriptlets, though.  I think maybe you are confused as to what the scriptlets do.  They are not the way in which the package gets installed; rpm knows how to do that already.
May 22 14:02:58 <tibbs>	Scriptlets are just supplementary actions which some (but not nearly all) packages need to take.
May 22 14:03:07 <otaylor>	yetoo: what particular error do you get?
May 22 14:03:35 <LetoTo>	 mzabaluev: I have no problem for you to become the maintainer. I'm maintaining it because the previous maintainer stopped and I needed some new things enabled and newer version to do proper interop testing with libreswan
May 22 14:04:15 <LetoTo>	some of these bugs look old though
May 22 14:04:16 <otaylor>	yetoo: At a high level - if you want to do i686 development on x86_64 box, use a mock, a container, or a vm. multilib only goes so far
May 22 14:05:06 <yetoo>	I was thinking that
May 22 14:05:26 <tibbs>	LetoTo: One interesting issue is that you aren't listed as a maintainer; I assume you're using provenpackager privs.
May 22 14:05:30 <tibbs>	I can add you to the package if you want.
May 22 14:06:02 <yetoo>	The problem is, I have the package uninstalled, but there are conflicts with the feodra 28 i686 package and the x86_64 package regardless
May 22 14:06:34 <otaylor>	yetoo: What command are you running, and what error are you seeing? Use fpaste if it's long
May 22 14:08:39 <yetoo>	It's this bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1581067
May 22 14:17:42 <otaylor>	yetoo: It's a bug ... it doesn't look trivial to fix. Maybe just not ship the .pyc files, but then I'd worry about gdbus-codegen or whatever run as root dropping unowned-by-a-package pyc files onto the filesystem
May 22 14:18:28 <otaylor>	You can find background by searching for "pyc reproducible build" - apparently pyc files have a timestamp so they won't be the same between any two builds
May 22 14:20:30 <halfline>	maybe ship the .py files in libdir instead of datadir ...
May 22 14:21:38 <otaylor>	halfline: that probably would work
May 22 14:22:04 <halfline>	stlll using a chroot is better indeed
May 22 14:22:09 <halfline>	multilib is such a headache
May 22 14:24:35 <otaylor>	halfline: it would be pretty messy, since /usr/bin/glib-codegen would have to be identical - so it would need to find the architecture, and then import from the right directory (we've done such things before...)
May 22 14:28:01 <halfline>	well $libdir/python/site-packages or whatever should already be in the default import path i think
May 22 14:29:23 <RaphGro>	is gdm still default display manager in the xfce spin?
May 22 14:29:42 <nirik>	no, it hasn't been for many many years.
May 22 14:30:38 <tachoknight>	hey all, is this a good place to ask about bodhi?
May 22 14:30:54 <halfline>	#fedora-apps is a better place i think
May 22 14:30:57 <tachoknight>	ok
May 22 14:31:58 <RaphGro>	nirik: what then? lightdm?
May 22 14:32:15 <RaphGro>	.bug 1580984
May 22 14:32:18 <zodbot>	RaphGro: Bug 1580984 – xfce-polkit crashes directly - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1580984
May 22 14:32:51 <nirik>	yes, lightdm
May 22 14:33:41 <RaphGro>	asked in #xfce, wayland is not officially supported (yet).
May 22 14:34:31 <nirik>	right. They aren't even fully on gtk3 yet
May 22 14:38:03 <RaphGro>	nirik: upstream won't release 4.14 before not full gtk3 support :P
May 22 14:38:37 *	nirik nods
May 22 14:38:40 <RaphGro>	someone promised something for chemnitz linux days but he lost the bet.
May 22 20:29:09 <mschorm|online>	Uhm, guys, do you get a 403: forbidden too?
May 22 20:29:10 <mschorm|online>	https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/95/27040095/community-mysql-devel-8.0.11-1.fc29.x86_64.rpm
May 22 20:32:46 <smooge>	mschorm|online, there is nothing in that directory
May 22 20:33:43 <mschorm|online>	good point
May 22 20:35:59 <mschorm|online>	nevermind. I used different task
May 22 20:36:30 <smooge>	mschorm|online, ok cool
May 23 02:28:25 <fnux>	I have a pagure question: I merged a PR locally (= not on src.fp.org) due to conflicts, but pagure did not understand it and I now have an unmerged PR containing 0 commits/no changes. What can I do and what went wrong ? Thanks!
May 23 03:29:01 <Venemo>	I'm compiling a kernel with fedpkg and getting a lot of warnings, is this normal?
May 23 03:29:43 <tomhughes>	it certainly wouldn't surprise me
May 23 03:30:10 <Venemo>	all of them come from __builtin_strncpy
May 23 05:09:22 <RvdB1111>	Howdy all! Can I ask something about building a rpm? I want to to place an systemd override.conf file for a service. Do I have to systemctl daemon-reload after it's installed?
May 23 10:22:50 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: ping, you referenced the other day me merging changes for el7, wouldn't I need some sort of permissions to do that? I created the PR with the updates figuring that I don't have the access to merge changes in to update the el7 package
May 23 10:24:07 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: oh re: python-pexpect epel7 build in case context is helpful
May 23 10:34:52 <ignatenkobrain>	radez: I would need someone to maintain it officially
May 23 10:35:02 <ignatenkobrain>	I could sponsor you if you would like to do this job
May 23 10:35:50 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: I would be happy to, is there a process for me to complete for you to sponsor me?
**** BEGIN LOGGING AT Wed May 23 12:00:57 2018

May 23 12:00:57 *	Now talking on #fedora-devel
May 23 12:00:57 *	Topic for #fedora-devel is: Fedora developers channel | end users: please ask for help in #fedora | Infra status http://status.fedoraproject.org/ | s390x now in primary koji for rawhide
May 23 12:00:57 *	Topic for #fedora-devel set by dgilmore (Fri Apr 28 18:02:05 2017)
May 23 14:02:50 <sdgathman>	I get: DEPRECATION WARNING: python2 invoked with /usr/bin/python when building a package.
May 23 14:03:05 <sdgathman>	The error is clear, but it won't tell me *where*!
May 23 14:03:50 <sdgathman>	I'm grepping all the files in BUILDROOT, and I can't find that stray python default.
May 23 14:04:20 <sdgathman>	Any suggestions on pattern to grep for?
May 23 14:11:44 <sdgathman>	The string '/usr/bin/python' does not occur anywhere without a '2' following.
May 23 14:12:05 <sdgathman>	Or the string 'python', except in comments.
May 23 14:15:00 <sdgathman>	It is reported (twice) after listing /builddir/build/BUILDROOT/cjdns-20.2-1.fc28.x86_64/usr/libexec/cjdns/python/cjdnsadmin/__init__.py
May 23 14:15:12 <sdgathman>	That file is empty.  Could that confuse it?
May 23 14:20:11 <tomhughes>	sdgathman: it's probably one of the rpm provides/requires hooks
May 23 14:20:57 <tomhughes>	I think I fixed the nodejs ones but others may have the same problem
May 23 14:21:56 <sdgathman>	https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/Abis-HSFLlGkzWKDVsZs5A
May 23 14:22:14 <sdgathman>	It Requires: python2
May 23 14:23:25 <sdgathman>	Maybe I need to delete the Provides, and the python_provides macro does it invisibly?
May 23 14:24:19 <sdgathman>	Maybe the comment means to ignore the error until F30...
May 23 14:28:36 <sdgathman>	Do you mean the nodejs build code invokes default python?  That might break the build come F30, but this error is in %install
May 23 14:29:34 <sdgathman>	The build would be the gyp stuff.
May 23 14:30:05 <sdgathman>	And that can be "fixed" with a symlink in %build
May 23 14:30:49 <sdgathman>	I'm going to ignore the error and start testing f28
May 23 14:31:20 <sdgathman>	I wish I had time to study the crypto deep enough to patch in libsodium support again.
May 23 14:31:37 <sdgathman>	The issue is that Sign.c makes some internal nacl calls...
May 23 14:31:55 <sdgathman>	But I'm pretty sure libsodium offers equivalents
May 23 14:33:45 <rdieter>	is this extra work to be rid of or change what python and gpg means, is largely wasteful imho (ie, has a bad cost/benefit ratio)
May 23 14:36:23 <sdgathman>	The value of declaring python2 as officially obsolete is a subjective one.
May 23 14:48:19 <tmz>	sdgathman: I think the warning you're getting with cjdns is due to the byte-compilation of the py files in /usr/libexec/cjdns.
May 23 14:48:39 <tmz>	That falls back to %{__python} and produces the warning.
May 23 14:48:58 <tmz>	%global __python %{__python2} should fix that, per https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Avoid_usr_bin_python_in_RPM_Build#Python_bytecompilation
May 23 14:49:10 <sdgathman>	tmz: thanks!
May 23 14:50:13 <tmz>	Once byte-compilation outside of the python libdirs is in place, that shouldn't cause the warning.
May 23 14:51:06 <tmz>	That's https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/No_more_automagic_Python_bytecompilation
May 23 14:52:11 <sdgathman>	tmz: that fixed it
May 23 14:52:31 <tmz>	Excellent.  I hoped I wouldn't regret not actually testing that before mentioning it. :)
May 23 15:15:11 <sdgathman>	Well, master works, but merging with f28 results in a mess.
May 23 15:15:51 <sdgathman>	Need to find git command to "make this branch like master".
May 23 15:16:01 <sdgathman>	bbl
May 23 15:19:11 <tomhughes>	sdgathman: I meant /usr/lib/rpm/nodejs.prov and /usr/lib/rpm/nodejs.req but I ported those to python3
May 23 15:19:39 <tomhughes>	but I have known gyp trigger it as well when the .gypi shells out to python
May 23 15:25:11 <tmz>	sdgathman: git merge -X theirs master might be what you what.  '-X theirs' tells the merge machinery to resolve all conflicts in favor of the branch being merged.
May 23 17:18:08 <cousin_luigi>	Greetings.
May 23 17:57:57 <jsmith>	eclipseo: Thanks for the package reviews, and don't worry about the timing.  There's no rush.
May 23 17:58:13 <jsmith>	eclipseo: Next week will be fine :-)
May 23 20:49:45 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: I offered earlier to officially maintain the el7 stuff for python-pexpect, is that something that needs a BZ to document is happening?
May 23 20:56:16 <sgallagh>	labbott: I have a probably-unrealistic question: how unrealistically hard would it be to ask the kernel to treat a port above 1024 like the lower ones (insofar as requiring privilege to bind to it)? Yes, I realize this would be in violation of standards.
May 23 21:09:58 <smooge>	I would expect that it would require a lot of liquor to davem
May 23 21:10:04 <smooge>	A LOT
May 23 21:10:25 <labbott>	sgallagh: you nerd sniped me I'm trying to figure this out
May 23 21:11:07 <sgallagh>	labbott: I can never tell whether to apologize or say "you're welcome" in situations like that
May 23 21:11:40 <sgallagh>	smooge: I can work with that. I've been building my own distillery and thus far have not burned my house down.
May 23 21:12:14 <smooge>	I would expect that the answer would be "That is what selinux is for"
May 23 21:13:06 <sgallagh>	smooge: Hmm, that hadn't occurred to me. But the default policy probably wouldn't protect against unconfined_t
May 23 21:13:19 <labbott>	https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg412098.html so there's this
May 23 21:13:37 <labbott>	and it seems like you could adjust it higher?
May 23 21:14:42 <labbott>	I'll also give the caveat that my networking knowledge is spotty
May 23 21:15:00 <sgallagh>	labbott: Perhaps, but that would mean making all ports of this value or lower protected.
May 23 21:15:09 <sgallagh>	Which is probably overkill :-/
May 23 21:15:43 <smooge>	at one point there was a plan on making ports below '16384'? protected as the 1024 space was full
May 23 21:16:08 <smooge>	but I think that went to the graveyard of 'boil the seas first'
May 23 21:16:14 <sgallagh>	smooge: I suspect that would be killed in committee simply because of... yeah
May 23 21:16:36 <smooge>	even 2048 was looking doomed
May 23 21:17:09 <smooge>	since you are looking at 9090
May 23 21:17:17 *	sgallagh nods
May 23 21:17:39 <smooge>	I haven't looked at it since 2.4? kernels myself so have no idea
May 23 21:18:41 <sgallagh>	smooge: But the SELinux policy idea might have some legs; we'd just have to get permission to ship a default config that disallows even unconfined_t from binding it (possibly with a boolean to loosen that)
May 23 21:18:53 <sgallagh>	I'll raise that thought on the mailing thread.
May 23 21:19:14 <labbott>	ahhhhh you want to make a single port
May 23 21:19:51 <smooge>	sgallagh, I am expecting that the problem is that anything like that will break someone who is using 9090 for their own damn thing and now can't get their oracle software to work
May 23 21:20:16 <labbott>	yeah I don't think there's a nice way to do that without aforementioned davem bribery.
May 23 21:20:18 <sgallagh>	labbott: Right, the context is that we want to disallow a non-privileged user from taking over the Cockpit socket if someone stops cockpit.socket but the firewall is still open
May 23 21:20:24 <smooge>	I still think move it to port 660 :)
May 23 21:20:43 <sgallagh>	smooge: That ship has sailed; 9090 is now a well-known port
May 23 21:21:18 <sgallagh>	labbott: Because someone setting up a MITM attack on that port would be Really Bad (TM)
May 23 21:21:20 <smooge>	isn't a well known port for other things also?
May 23 21:21:49 <sgallagh>	smooge: It was reserved for an IBM Server Manager service that is long dead
May 23 21:21:59 <sgallagh>	There were no other known projects using it, IIRC
May 23 21:22:19 <smooge>	ah that was what I was thinking.. we used it on AIX boxes
May 23 21:24:09 <labbott>	selinux or some other lsm seems like the best approach although that's also a hard hammer
May 23 21:25:29 <sgallagh>	labbott: Yeah, it probably is. Well, thank you for the investigation anyway!
May 23 23:23:02 <sandeen>	dumb/basic question: Does fedora (or its default desktop environment) auto-mount USB sticks that get plugged in by default?
May 23 23:25:14 *	sandeen grovels around in dconf-editor
May 23 23:27:38 <drakonis>	gnome is the default
May 23 23:27:45 <drakonis>	the answer is possibly
May 23 23:27:47 <drakonis>	maybe
May 23 23:27:58 <dgilmore>	sandeen: by default gnome automounts them
May 23 23:28:56 <dgilmore>	it is a individual desktop thing
May 23 23:30:12 <sandeen>	yeah, I see that now, thanks.  in the never-ending debate about whether crafted filesystem images are security threats.  and if desktops helpfully blow up the threat model for on-disk filesystems ... :/
May 23 23:30:34 <sandeen>	seems like it'd be wise to at least expand the automounting configuration to say "mount fat, but not $RANDOM_FS_FOUND_IN_PARKING_LOT"
May 23 23:31:32 <sandeen>	and focus on hardening the common/simple usb formats, to keep the convenience and lessen the risks
May 23 23:36:48 <dgilmore>	indeed
May 24 00:57:23 <DrNick>	hot-plugging USB (or any other device) should be a privileged operation
May 24 00:57:30 <DrNick>	never mind mounting a filesystem
May 24 01:34:51 <ignatenkobrain>	radez: nope, it just needs a bit of my free time
May 24 01:34:56 <ignatenkobrain>	which is hard to find until weekend
May 24 02:03:25 <cousin_luigi>	Pharaoh_Atem: ping
May 24 02:03:26 <zodbot>	cousin_luigi: Ping with data, please: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/No_naked_pings
May 24 02:03:50 <cousin_luigi>	Pharaoh_Atem: Do you plan any new release of rpmdevtools anytime soon?
May 24 04:53:34 <kashyap>	puiterwijk++
May 24 05:30:21 <ingvarha>	pardon my ignorence, but what type of repositories are found under https://src.fedoraproject.org/modules/ ?
May 24 05:30:39 <tomhughes>	git repositories
May 24 05:31:11 <ingvarha>	Ah, yes. I meant what kind of sources. The package build sources are kept under https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/varnish/
May 24 05:31:18 <ingvarha>	so what are "modules" ?
May 24 05:31:23 <tomhughes>	module sources ;-)
May 24 05:31:30 <ingvarha>	what kind of modules?
May 24 05:31:36 <tomhughes>	well that's a big question and one I barely pretend to understand
May 24 05:31:51 <tomhughes>	try https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Modularity
May 24 05:32:38 <ingvarha>	aha
May 24 05:32:50 <ingvarha>	"Modularity provides an environment for packagers to maintain and build software in multiple versions which will be used as an input for automatic container rebuilds"
May 24 05:32:53 <ingvarha>	okay
May 24 06:04:45 <nils>	pingou, hey, I can't seem to assign someone/myself to a PR on Pagure where I'm one of the project admins, is there something I'm missing?
May 24 06:05:54 <nils>	ingvarha, feel free to pop over to #fedora-modularity. I can answer your questions here of course but over there the others can chime in, too.
May 24 06:14:54 <nils>	ingvarha, and just for the record :), containers are one way to package modular software content but you can also use them as regular packages
May 24 08:30:56 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: okey doke, I'll hang tight till you're able to do it :) thanks!
May 24 09:42:33 <sgallagh>	labbott: Congrats on making it on LWN's kernel quotes of the week :)
May 24 09:44:13 <labbott>	haha I saw :)
May 24 10:03:37 <smooge>	labbott, congrats. as one of your bot followers I appreciate the shout out :)
May 24 10:23:34 <jcline>	ignatenkobrain, hey, matrix-synapse is broken in F28 and is blocked by https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1563671, could you update that when you have a chance?
May 24 10:24:02 <jcline>	I also don't mind doing it if you want a co-maintainer on that package
May 24 10:28:04 <ignatenkobrain>	jcline: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/3zIFbeByqJQ9R6QmfedoPQ
May 24 10:28:09 <ignatenkobrain>	feel free to use this patch to avoid such problems in future
May 24 10:29:21 <jcline>	ignatenkobrain, ah nice, thanks
May 24 10:29:44 <ignatenkobrain>	anyway, I'm updating canonicaljson now
May 24 10:29:48 <ignatenkobrain>	also will add you as a maintainer
May 24 10:30:06 <jcline>	Thanks!
May 24 10:30:08 <jcline>	ignatenkobrain++
May 24 10:30:09 <zodbot>	jcline: Karma for ignatenkobrain changed to 2 (for the f28 release cycle):  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/tags/cookie/any

May 24 12:14:28 <indy>	nirik, ping hi, can you approve my membership in freecad group?
May 24 12:16:03 <nirik>	indy: please talk to przemof ? they are the group owner...
May 24 12:20:06 <indy>	nirik, i forgot process :)
May 24 13:13:28 <ignatenkobrain>	jcline: did you submit updates?
May 24 13:13:38 <jcline>	ignatenkobrain, yup
May 24 13:14:02 <jcline>	I found that python2-pysaml disappeared in rawhide so now I've got a different problem :(
May 24 13:19:35 <tibbs>	Why does rpmgrill complain about missing manpages for files like /etc/logrotate.d/foo or /etc/pam.d/foo?
May 24 13:21:05 <tibbs>	Ideally I'd clean my packages up to the point where there aren't any complaints but it seems like that's not possible.
May 24 13:27:42 <tibbs>	And rpmlint cleanliness is still just hopeless.  I mean, yes, a directory containing everybody's mail is supposed to be mode 700.  Why throw an error for that?
May 24 13:32:22 <adamw>	tibbs: i think you can actually ship an rpmlintrc in your package repo that will be used when the rpmlint test is run. i've never seen it but i've got that idea somewhere.
May 24 13:33:11 <adamw>	tibbs: is the file in /etc/logrotate.d executable?
May 24 13:33:18 <tibbs>	adamw: It is not.
May 24 13:33:24 <adamw>	hum. then i dunno.
May 24 13:34:23 <tibbs>	I do wonder how other distros actually make rpmlint passage a requirement for packages to build.
May 24 13:34:48 <adamw>	extremely permissive configuration, i'm guessing.
May 24 13:34:52 <adamw>	tibbs: can you link to the rpmgrill result?
May 24 13:35:27 <tibbs>	https://taskotron.fedoraproject.org/artifacts/all/ffe71fce-5b08-11e8-99a0-525400fc9f92/tests.yml/rpmgrill.json
May 24 13:35:44 <tibbs>	One complaint about clamscan; I don't think there's anything I can do about that.
May 24 13:36:04 <tibbs>	Some of the manpage complaints are valid, but some aren't.
May 24 13:36:52 <adamw>	yeah, the clamscan thing seems like a bug in the task
May 24 13:36:52 <tibbs>	And the one about using a non-numeric gid.... Yes, the specfile defines %gid to something and then uses %gid later.
May 24 13:37:31 <tibbs>	I understand what checks are good, but if I get the same "did you check this" warning every time, I'm just going to stop checking eventually.
May 24 13:38:58 <adamw>	https://pagure.io/taskotron/task-rpmgrill/issue/7
May 24 13:39:27 <tibbs>	I figured that was a well known problem; it must hit every package.
May 24 13:39:32 <adamw>	i just reported it. :P
May 24 13:39:39 <adamw>	so now it's known!
May 24 13:39:54 <adamw>	i suspect possibly if that's the only failure the test doesn't show as failed, or something...
May 24 13:42:57 <adamw>	tibbs: yeah, check https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-5d9f05fb6a
May 24 13:43:25 <adamw>	VirusCheck is 'failed' there, but the rpmgrill test shows as green in the Automated Tests tab
May 24 13:43:36 <adamw>	wow, and so does rpmlint, someone deserves a medal
May 24 13:43:49 <tibbs>	I have small packages which are rpmlint clean.
May 24 13:43:49 <adamw>	jcline: here, have a medal
May 24 13:43:53 <adamw>	jcline++
May 24 13:43:53 <zodbot>	adamw: Karma for jcline changed to 4 (for the f28 release cycle):  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/tags/cookie/any
May 24 13:44:05 <tibbs>	But anything even mildly complicated is bound to hit something.
May 24 13:44:16 <adamw>	tibbs: i don't think i've ever once yet managed to write a package summary which rpmlint didn't think had a spelling error in it. :P
May 24 13:44:25 <jcline>	I don't know what I did, but I'll take it
May 24 13:44:41 <tibbs>	The spelling thing is just painful.
May 24 13:45:01 <tibbs>	And since rpmlintrc is executable code, you can never actually use one that came from someone else.
May 24 13:45:27 <tibbs>	Well, unless you trust them or you only ever lint a specfile inside a container or something.
May 24 13:45:59 <jcline>	Oh that's my update
May 24 13:46:39 <adamw>	jcline: right. you created an update which passed all automated tests. you're some kind of monster from the future, aren't you?
May 24 13:46:40 <tibbs>	Personally I have a system where the specfile parsed for markers and an rpmlint config file is created from that.  But of course that only works for me.
May 24 13:47:22 <tibbs>	I really wish we could adopt such a system (and rpmlint would grow a non-executable config file).
May 24 13:47:37 <jcline>	adamw, ha, I just wrote a post-commit git hook to waive every test for all my packages just in case one fails
May 24 13:47:51 <adamw>	jcline--
May 24 13:47:56 <adamw>	.fire jcline
May 24 13:47:56 <zodbot>	adamw fires jcline
May 24 13:47:57 <jcline>	I am, of course, joking. I couldn't figure out how to waive an update at all.
May 24 13:48:12 <adamw>	hahah that's pathetic and certainly not the same thing that happened to me
May 24 13:48:25 <jcline>	Haha
May 24 13:51:37 <bowlofeggs>	adamw, tibbs: the bodhi package has an rpmlintrc if you want an example of how to get taskotron to use it
May 24 13:51:55 <bowlofeggs>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/bodhi/blob/master/f/bodhi.rpmlintrc
May 24 13:52:17 <bowlofeggs>	you just create a file called <src_pkgname>.rpmlintrc in git and off you go
May 24 13:52:23 <bowlofeggs>	it's python even though it doesn't end in .py
May 24 13:53:42 <bowlofeggs>	adamw: lol
May 24 13:54:49 *	adamw is going to keep quiet about how he's not entirely sure taskotron is running rpmlint in a disposable environment every time...
May 24 13:54:51 <adamw>	oh whoops.
May 24 13:55:21 <tflink>	adamw: how's that?
May 24 13:55:38 <adamw>	oh, just the thing about rpmlintrc being arbitrary code...
May 24 13:56:25 <adamw>	i mean, it probably can't really do much damage, and it's not like you could cover your tracks if you wanted to do something mean with one.
May 24 13:56:42 <tflink>	not sure I follow - how does that mean that rpmlint/rpmgrill isn't run in a disposable environment?
May 24 13:57:01 <adamw>	other way around
May 24 13:57:14 <adamw>	it means that it *should* be, and i wasn't 100% sure whether it is
May 24 13:57:24 <tflink>	all tasks are run in a fresh vm
May 24 13:57:45 <tibbs>	Does that VM have network access?
May 24 13:57:58 <adamw>	ah, okay. i knew we were making that *possible*, but didn't know we were making all tasks do it.
May 24 13:58:12 <tibbs>	If not there are some tests which really should be disabled by default.
May 24 13:58:36 <tibbs>	I noted that it logged a timeout trying to check BugURL:, for example.  I guess that will always fail.
May 24 13:58:40 <tflink>	yes, it does. there are a few restrictions on what the vm can access within fedora infra but it can access the internet
May 24 13:59:26 <tflink>	hrm ,the firewall rules I'm aware of shouldn't affect access to rhbz
May 24 14:00:39 <tflink>	adamw: we've been running everything in disposable VMs for a while now. it's an option to bypass that if you're running locally but it's not an option for tasks run in our production deployments
May 24 14:00:43 <tibbs>	And it was only within the path couple of months that we started adding BugURL to every package.
May 24 14:01:02 <tflink>	odd
May 24 14:01:36 <tflink>	is that rpmgrill?
May 24 14:03:59 <tibbs>	It's the rpmlint call.
May 24 14:04:03 <tibbs>	dist.rpmlint
May 24 14:04:14 <tibbs>	For example, https://taskotron.fedoraproject.org/artifacts/all/00128650-5b09-11e8-8c35-525400fc9f92/tests.yml/cyrus-imapd-3.0.7-2.fc29.log
May 24 14:04:24 <tibbs>	"cyrus-imapd.src: W: invalid-url BugURL: https://bugz.fedoraproject.org/cyrus-imapd The read operation timed out"
May 24 14:04:59 <tflink>	ah, that might run into firewall rules, I thought it was a direct link to RHBZ
May 24 14:06:54 <tflink>	hrm, I wonder if it's the redirect. i have no idea how rpmlint handles not-200 responses
May 24 14:07:18 <adamw>	hum, on the clamav thing, the rpmgrill package does try to pull it in...wonder if the deps somehow changed
May 24 14:07:23 <adamw>	# For the antivirus plugin
May 24 14:07:24 <adamw>	Requires: data(clamav)
May 24 14:07:24 <adamw>	Suggests: clamav-data
May 24 14:08:07 <adamw>	ah
May 24 14:08:07 <adamw>	no
May 24 14:08:10 <adamw>	it just got broken recently
May 24 14:08:20 *	adamw can fix that
May 24 14:08:34 <adamw>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/rpmgrill/c/d0dd3c6fbc9bdc6c309f176579e6b758ce0daa37?branch=master
May 24 14:08:36 <adamw>	spot the error. :P
May 24 14:12:21 *	adamw sends out updates
May 24 14:14:36 <adamw>	tibbs: aha
May 24 14:14:43 <adamw>	i can explain your manpage mystery
May 24 14:14:55 <adamw>	https://github.com/default-to-open/rpmgrill/blob/e38fd05232efff6f0cf316818b9ce7c0ed45a764/lib/RPM/Grill/Plugin/ManPages.pm#L246-L247
May 24 14:15:23 <adamw>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=647369
May 24 14:16:25 <adamw>	rpmgrill considers all files under /etc marked as config files in the rpm to require a manpage, because that bug asked for it. the rationale for the bug in the first place is...unclear.
May 24 14:17:03 <adamw>	it seems the code got from rpmdiff into rpmgrill and wasn't removed from rpmgrill when it was removed from rpmdiff...or something?
May 24 14:18:21 *	adamw sends rpmgrill PR
May 24 14:27:12 <tibbs>	adamw: Do note that bug is private.
May 24 14:27:25 <adamw>	tibbs: sigh. can you read it?
May 24 14:28:04 <adamw>	pet hates: private bugs referenced in public code
May 24 14:31:38 <DrNick>	pet hates: rdar URLs
May 24 14:39:10 <tibbs>	adamw: No, it's not exposed to me.  Looks like a relatively old bug, though.
May 24 14:39:28 <adamw>	tibbs: ok, so i'll summarize...
May 24 14:39:50 <adamw>	it's a bug against the old RPMDiff requesting that it check that all files under /etc marked as 'config' have a man page, without any clear justification as to why
May 24 14:40:32 <adamw>	it was filed in 2010
May 24 14:40:43 <adamw>	the check was pushed live for RHEL in 2012
May 24 14:41:15 <adamw>	in 2013, someone posts noting that there've been lots of triggers and some "complaints" about the check, and asks for some kind of justification for it
May 24 14:41:17 <tibbs>	you mean rpmgrill?
May 24 14:41:32 <adamw>	no. RPMDiff.
May 24 14:41:39 <adamw>	let me finish my story. :P
May 24 14:42:05 <adamw>	there's some back and forth about whether there's a guideline to justify the check, and whether it needs one
May 24 14:42:08 <adamw>	then the ticket sits for a bit
May 24 14:42:56 <adamw>	then later in 2013 there's another round of discussion and the check gets removed on the basis that there's no guideline to justify it and no-one wanted to push one. that happened in september.
May 24 14:44:11 <adamw>	it looks to me like someone added a similar check to rpmgrill (it's not actually the same, as it doesn't restrict the check to 'files under /etc') in mid-2013, on the basis of this bug...but then it didn't get taken *out* from rpmgrill when it was taken out from RPMDiff
May 24 14:47:25 <tibbs>	Is this RPMDiff tool something different than /usr/bin/rpmdiff that comes with rpmlint?
May 24 14:48:42 <tibbs>	Because the tool I'm used to doesn't care about manual pages and doesn't warn about anything.  It just lists changes between two packages.
May 24 14:49:50 <adamw>	yeah
May 24 14:50:00 <tibbs>	Explains my confusion, at least.
May 24 14:50:09 <adamw>	RPMDiff is/was an internal RH thing. i think rpmgrill is basically a public fork of it.
May 24 15:05:48 -tomaw-	[Global Notice] Hi all. We need to take services (NickServ, ChanServ and their friends) offline for a few minutes for maintenance. Downtime's expected to be less than 30 minutes.
May 24 15:13:26 -NickServ-	This nickname is registered. Please choose a different nickname, or identify via /msg NickServ identify <password>.
May 24 15:16:55 -tomaw-	[Global Notice] NickServ, ChanServ and their friends are back up and running as normal now!
May 24 15:25:26 -mquin-	:[Global Notice] Seems that was premature. There are ongoing issues with services that are being looked into - please bear with us
May 24 15:26:03 <adamw>	tibbs: https://github.com/default-to-open/rpmgrill/pull/23
May 24 15:27:01 <halfline>	arjan van de ven wrote it
May 24 15:27:08 <tibbs>	Thanks. That rule makes basically no sense.
May 24 15:27:09 <halfline>	back when he worked at red hat
May 24 15:27:40 <tibbs>	I mean, I could document the configuration settings in the manpage for the main program.  Or there could be one program with several configuration files.
May 24 15:33:15 -NickServ-	This nickname is registered. Please choose a different nickname, or identify via /msg NickServ identify <password>.
May 24 15:36:30 -mquin-	:[Global Notice] Services are back now but may be busy for the next few minutes. You may need to identify to NickServ again
May 24 15:39:06 -tomaw-	[Global Notice] As anyone who works with computers knows, they're out to get us. That turned out to be more complicated that it should've been and you may find you need to /msg NickServ IDENTIFY YOURPASSWORD to be able to access your account. Sorry for the noise!
May 24 15:43:37 -mquin-	[Global Notice] Note that if you are having difficulty changing nickname you can identify to NickServ using the format '/msg NickServ identify accountname password'
May 24 17:19:13 <adamw>	ajax: did you see https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/58705#comment169691 ?
May 24 17:19:20 <adamw>	i'm about to try with that patch
May 24 17:39:38 <jaroslav>	pvalena: Is there a chance to have vagrant 2.0.4 in F28?
May 24 21:04:09 <adamw>	tibbs: so, you successfully nerd-sniped me into spending all day fixing rpmgrill bugs :P
May 24 21:13:12 <tibbs>	My sincerest apologies.
May 24 21:14:07 <rdieter>	not sure how I missed that xkcd before, but learned something new (nerd sniping)
May 25 03:47:05 <pvalena>	jaroslav: possibly.. any specific reason? Could you file a bug for that? https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora
May 25 04:22:17 <jaroslav>	pvalena: in the meantime I've discovered that the bug that was supposed to be fixed in 2.0.4, actually is *not* fixed; I've created a pull request for that in Vagrant in the night
May 25 04:23:26 <jaroslav>	pvalena: the issue is with the network configuration for Debian *guest* -- the systemd-networkd configuration is created as 99-vagrant.network, so it ends up being *after* the default 99-default.network
May 25 04:24:06 <jaroslav>	pvalena: which makes it impossible to assign a static IP, because your static IP is in 99-vagrant.network, and the 99-default.network (which comes first) assigns DHCP for every interface matching "e*" :D
May 25 04:24:27 <jaroslav>	pvalena: there was a patch in 2.0.4, but it is wrong and it doesn't fix it
May 25 04:25:28 <pvalena>	jaroslav: hmm, interesting, do you have example Vagrantfile
May 25 04:25:59 <pvalena>	jaroslav: in that case you can file the bug anyway, at least we'll know about the issue and I can backport the patch
May 25 04:27:20 <jaroslav>	pvalena: yeah, basically the simplest you can imagine, where you define a static IP, you can see my PR here: https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/pull/9867
May 25 04:27:40 <jaroslav>	pvalena: and sure, I will create  a BZ for that; and I'll update the ticket if / when my PR is merged upstream
May 25 04:28:24 <jaroslav>	pvalena: I believe debian guest is not something 'exotic', so it would be nice to have that working ;)
May 25 04:30:43 <jaroslav>	pvalena: in the patch added for 2.0.4 they changed the priority of incorrect file, instead of fixing /etc/systemd/network/*-vagrant.network, they changed /etc/netplan/*-vagrant.yaml which of course doesn't work for systemd-networkd enabled systems... check out the original patch: https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/pull/9646/files
May 25 08:29:18 <lkeijser>	hi, I was wondering where I could find the srpm for firefox-56  , anyone?
May 25 08:31:33 <Guest96908>	two options - go back through koji until you find it, or checkout distgit and go back to an appropriate commit and "fedpkg srpm"
May 25 08:33:26 <lkeijser>	Tom, thanks!
May 25 08:36:14 <tomhughes>	that's better...
May 25 08:36:22 <tomhughes>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=980524 is the last build of 56 I think
May 25 09:20:04 <t0dd[m]>	anyone own the opensuse mock tree definitions? Any chance we can update them to include Leap 42.[123]?

May 25 09:22:42 <tomhughes>	wrong zodbot: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/mock-core-configs
May 25 09:23:53 <tomhughes>	but a PR for https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/tree/devel/mock-core-configs/etc/mock will probably be the best apparoach in any case
May 25 10:23:14 <xvitaly[m]>	Hello all. Trying to build libpurple plugin for rawhide but got this error: `nothing provides libidn.so.11()(64bit) needed by libpurple-2.13.0-1.fc29.x86_64`.
May 25 10:25:58 <t0dd[m]>	tomhughes: Thanks.
May 25 10:32:45 <tomhughes>	xvitaly[m]: you'll need libpurple rebuilt first then
May 25 10:33:53 <xvitaly[m]>	tomhughes: I'm not maintainer of libpurple package in Fedora.
May 25 10:34:28 <tomhughes>	I didn't say you were ;-)
May 25 10:34:40 <xvitaly[m]>	tomhughes: I'm building purple-skypeweb package in Koji.
May 25 10:34:57 <tomhughes>	sure, but there has been an soname bump
May 25 10:35:11 <tomhughes>	so libpurple needs rebuilding and can't be installed until that is done
May 25 10:35:24 <tomhughes>	so if your package needs it you need to get somebody to fix it before you can build your package
May 25 10:36:57 <tomhughes>	libidn was rebuilt on the 15th (https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1081901) and now provides so.12 not so.11
May 25 10:37:14 <tomhughes>	pidgin hasn't been rebuilt since
May 25 10:38:15 <tomhughes>	mlichvar said when he announced the bump that he would do the rebuilds but pidgin seems to have been missed
May 25 10:38:37 <tomhughes>	hmm actually he said "will need to be rebuilt"

May 25 11:34:06 <tmz>	It looks like zlib-1.2.11-8.fc28 reached stable and has some issues.  The same code is in git and built in koji for rawhide, but it's not in rawhide.
May 25 11:34:22 <tmz>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1582555
May 25 11:35:07 <tmz>	I was trying to find why it wasn't also in rawhide, but I don't know where that might be.
May 25 11:43:47 <tmz>	https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-f484bed78a was the zlib update.  It got +5 karma which is nice, but wasn't enough to detect the breakage.
May 25 11:49:23 <orionp>	Is there there any utility like who or w that doesn't truncate the username?
May 25 11:57:32 <adamw>	tmz: that...is actually a good question

May 25 11:58:26 <tmz>	adamw: Thanks.  I don't feel bad that I couldn't find it, if you don't see it offhand either. :)
May 25 11:59:34 <nirik>	looks like it was stuck in signing perhaps?
May 25 11:59:38 <tmz>	I ran into it while trying to build git and before I could track it down Pavel ran into it running git log and reported it.

May 25 12:00:01 <adamw>	btw, unfortunately arch-specific issues are just the sort of thing that tend to get through bodhi :/
May 25 12:00:08 <adamw>	five people on x86_64 have no problem, update's gonna go out
May 25 12:00:13 <tmz>	Yeah.
May 25 12:00:26 <adamw>	seems like zlib's test suite is missing something, though, clearly
May 25 12:00:36 <adamw>	(i just checked and it is run during package build)
May 25 12:00:41 <tmz>	Although it looked like some of the testers were using aarch.
May 25 12:01:07 <mboddu>	adamw: Yeah, it got stuck in signing, probably it will be picked up tonight's compose since it got tagged after last night compose started
May 25 12:01:12 <tmz>	Autopush was disabled there, which I thought would be so probinson could get feedback from aarch users, as the update really only applied to them.
May 25 12:01:30 <adamw>	hum, could be. we'd have to ask him
May 25 12:01:56 <adamw>	i guess if so, none of them happened to run into this issue before saying it was good :/
May 25 12:01:58 <tmz>	I'll add him to the Cc on the bug if he's not there already.

May 25 12:04:30 <pbrobinson>	mboddu: it was stuck in signing

May 25 12:05:51 <mboddu>	pbrobinson: Yup, which is what I said :)
May 25 12:05:59 <mboddu>	Anyway, I should stop looking at irc and pack
May 25 12:06:36 <mboddu>	adamw: I know this is a long shot, but I am visiting Quebec City this weekend, any plans like that for you?
May 25 12:06:45 <adamw>	nope! sorry
May 25 12:06:45 <tibbs>	Does anyone have a pointer to where I can read up on the various libva drivers we ship?
May 25 12:06:53 <adamw>	tibbs: -----> they all suck
May 25 12:06:55 <adamw>	there you go.
May 25 12:07:07 <mboddu>	adamw: Okay :)
May 25 12:07:19 <tibbs>	mboddu: I love Quebec City.
May 25 12:07:40 <pbrobinson>	tibbs: yes, what adamw says, and I think we mostly ship the libraries with the actual drivers being in rpmfusion
May 25 12:07:46 <mboddu>	tibbs: I have never been there, so I am very much excited
May 25 12:08:03 <tmz>	Oh, pbrobinson, I was mistyping your nick, so I didn't notice you were here.  If you're not on that bug, it's probably one you can help with. :)
May 25 12:08:13 <tmz>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1582555 -- that is.
May 25 12:09:16 <pbrobinson>	tmz: please give at least the summary here, i've got better things to do than wait for BZ to load
May 25 12:09:37 <tibbs>	mboddu: I was there in October.  One thing we did was a food tour.  I can certainly recommend our tour guide; can get info to you if you like.
May 25 12:09:44 <tmz>	pbrobinson: regression in zlib-1.2.11-8: ARM optimizations broke git log on aarch64
May 25 12:10:54 <pbrobinson>	which package? the one I saw about that was actually a problem with the tests in the package, fix was pulled from upstream
May 25 12:11:34 <pbrobinson>	tmz: the patches were from ARM themselves and the partner engineer is maintaining the patch set and is responsive, I merely pushed them for him
May 25 12:11:45 <tibbs>	mboddu: One interesting thing is that most of the visiting tourists were Korean when we were there. There was an extremely popular Korean television show ("Goblin") which is partially set in Quebec City and people were still streaming over to see the various locations.
May 25 12:12:40 <tmz>	pbrobinson: Okay.  They seem to be a bit broken.  The git test suite fails miserably with them, which makes me concerned that using git with that zlib on aarch could lead to corruption of data.
May 25 12:13:09 <tibbs>	pbrobinson, adamw: Ah, OK, so then that libva-intel-driver that rpmfusion has is important.
May 25 12:13:42 <tmz>	pbrobinson: Is the partner engineer someone that will be on the default Cc for zlib bugs or do we need add him so he can take a look?
May 25 12:13:56 <tibbs>	But we have libva-intel-hybrid-driver which also sounds like a driver.  I just wonder if there's a page or documentation or something on what should actually be installed.
May 25 12:14:26 <tibbs>	And then what on Earth you do if you have AMD graphics and not Intel.
May 25 12:15:26 <pbrobinson>	tmz: I've just assigned it to jlinton, these patches ship in ChromeOS and elsewhere, I very much doubt there bad, but I might be wrong, lets give ARM a chance to fix it
May 25 12:15:39 <pbrobinson>	tmz: he was already on it
May 25 12:15:59 <tmz>	pbrobinson: Thanks.
May 25 12:16:36 <pbrobinson>	tmz: no issue, he's generally on #fedora-arm too if you want a quicker response, Austin TX based from memory
May 25 12:18:34 <tmz>	pbrobinson: Cool.  Pavel did the detective work in tracking this down.  I just stumbled into it afterward while building a git update.  With luck it'll be obvious where the problem is and we can get it fixed in whatever compenent.
May 25 12:18:39 <Guest32548>	tibbs: Mesa has libva drivers for AMD and NV, IIRC.
May 25 12:19:26 <tibbs>	Hmm, OK.  So maybe... I should just install them all and hope the system will load whichever it needs when necessary.
May 25 12:20:06 <farnz>	tibbs: libva-intel-driver supports H.264, MPEG-2, VC-1 and JPEG with hardware assist; libva-intel-hybrid-driver reuses the hardware support for H.264 and VC-1 to also support VP8/VP9 on hardware that doesn't have "native" VPx support.
May 25 12:20:15 <pbrobinson>	tibbs: or crash, not tried for a while but the intel ones use to crash my laptop
May 25 12:20:41 <tibbs>	Yeah, that's the other outcome, I guess.
May 25 12:21:01 <tibbs>	famz: Thanks, that's useful.
May 25 12:21:09 <farnz>	tibbs: And assuming that all the software in the stack is bug-free, from kernel through libdrm through drivers through libva, you can just install the lot and let it load the drivers you need.
May 25 12:21:23 <farnz>	Note the *big* assumption there, though.
May 25 12:21:52 <tibbs>	Well, it's easy to roll them out and then see if machines start crashing.
May 25 12:22:23 <tibbs>	I have a reasonably good cross section of more recent Intel hardware around.
May 25 12:23:48 <tibbs>	Everything from i3-2100 up to i7-8700K with every generating in between (except for desktop Broadwell; I never did buy into that line).
May 25 12:26:46 <eclipseo>	farnz: libva-hybrid doesn't work anymore witf tfe new libva 2.0
May 25 12:27:05 <eclipseo>	and upstream is urresponsive
May 25 12:27:07 <farnz>	eclipseo: Ah. I haven't kept up to date on that one (no VP8/VP9 at home)
May 25 12:27:42 <tibbs>	Basically I guess my users would like it if youtube playback was accelerated.
May 25 12:32:39 <tibbs>	eclipseo: Interestingly, the intel-hybrid-driver requires libva 2.0.
May 25 12:34:26 <tibbs>	As of the commit they made in October, at least; that's not in any release.
May 25 12:35:01 <tibbs>	But it does look like that code is only very lightly maintained.
May 25 12:38:57 <eclipseo>	tibbs: yes they made a couple of commit regarding libva 2 upstream, but it still doesn't work
May 25 12:39:46 <eclipseo>	quick question, is there a guideline regarding which characters are allowed in a package name?
May 25 12:40:26 <eclipseo>	ah found it
May 25 12:40:46 <tibbs>	Yeah, it's at the top of Packaging:Naming
May 25 12:42:31 <eclipseo>	underscore are to be avoided right
May 25 12:43:19 <tibbs>	Underscores are where it gets overly complicated.
May 25 12:43:56 <tibbs>	The text in the guidelines there is just painful and I've been meaning to rewrite it for years.
May 25 12:44:03 <tibbs>	What's the upstream name of the software?
May 25 12:44:43 <eclipseo>	python-collectd_cvmfs
May 25 12:45:02 <eclipseo>	seems there's other python packages with underscore
May 25 12:45:11 <eclipseo>	and it's the Pypi nme
May 25 12:45:46 <tibbs>	Yeah, basically the issue is that we don't use an underscore as a "separator".  But then the guidelines don't really define what that means.
May 25 12:47:06 <tibbs>	But python-collectd_cvmfs is OK as a source package name as long as the underscore is there upstream.
May 25 12:47:24 <eclipseo>	okay thanks
May 25 12:47:37 <tibbs>	When we add a separator, like foo-devel or python-foo or whatever, that separator must be a dash.

May 25 18:27:20 <jcline>	orionp, if that's on rawhide it's possibly the change to how the crng gets initialized. It should eventually get initialized and continue. On VMs you can also use virtio-rng, assuming the platform you're running it on supports it.
May 25 18:27:56 <orionp>	jcline: Fedora 28 - and apparetnly F27 as well - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1561051
May 25 18:28:56 <orionp>	could be rng related as well - some steps related to that seem slow too.
May 25 18:29:31 <jcline>	Interesting. Well, the installation media for F27 and F28 didn't have that change so it isn't that.
May 25 18:35:01 <orionp>	I tried enabling a bunch of systemd/journald/kernel debug messages but never got anything useful to see why systemd-journald failed to start.
May 25 18:37:03 *	nirik knows of no one who tests that, so it's not surprising it's not working
May 25 18:45:22 <mschorm>	Guys, I need your help.   Please, take a look at mariadb SPECfile and tell me, why it won't pass the rpm parser.
May 25 18:45:53 <mschorm>	   fedpkg clone mariadb && cd mariadb && fedpkg sprm     -> parser error
May 25 18:50:58 <ajax>	mschorm: that's... remarkable.

May 28 19:31:12 <adamw>	huh.
May 28 19:31:15 <adamw>	this is weird.
May 28 19:31:20 <adamw>	why are git error messages in fedora the wrong case?
May 28 19:32:12 <adamw>	oh gah, just upstream changed it.
May 28 19:43:29 <tmz>	adamw: You meant upstream git or some other upstream?
May 28 19:43:37 <adamw>	upstream git.
May 28 19:43:57 <adamw>	for boring reasons, this now means i get to fiddle around with perl regexes, whee
May 28 19:44:01 <tmz>	Generally, the standard there is lower case
May 28 19:45:29 <adamw>	yes. which is why they changed this message that was upper case.
May 28 19:45:52 <adamw>	unfortunately, this test is still going to have to handle the message as printed by older git.
May 28 19:46:55 <tmz>	Gotcha.  I guess once you fix things to use /i for the regex's you'll be good for a while.
May 28 19:47:23 <adamw>	well, that would work if there *was* a regex before. :P
May 28 19:47:49 <tmz>	Obviously, using the plumbing commands is the best plan, as upstream tries to keep that consistent.
May 28 19:48:06 <tmz>	But depending on what you're testing, that might not be an option.
May 28 19:48:32 <adamw>	it's not my test.
May 28 19:49:19 <tmz>	Ah.  Well nudge whomever toward not screen scraping git porcelain commands, if possible. :)
May 28 19:52:18 <adamw>	they're not, exactly. just forwarding messages from the git command. just so happens the message they used to test that this works properly is one that got changed...
May 29 05:14:01 <jridky>	hi folks, how should I correctly obsolete python2 subpackage from packages I am maintaining? Is there some %python_obsolete macro or something similar?
May 29 06:37:25 <mcepl>	Could anybody point me to some decision or document declaring that Group tag in SPEC file should not be used anymore?
May 29 06:38:11 <mcepl>	some discussion on the topic or something?
May 29 06:38:24 <rsc>	mcepl: uhm, it's IIRC in the packaging guidelines
May 29 06:39:04 <mcepl>	rsc: I know https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Tags_and_Sections
May 29 06:39:09 <mcepl>	but how it got there?
May 29 06:39:27 <mcepl>	I am trying to persuade openSUSE people to drop it as well, and I would like some arguments
May 29 06:41:38 <rsc>	mcepl: I just recall that groups were not treated as useful or so.
May 29 06:41:41 <rsc>	*remember
May 29 06:57:36 <pjp>	After upgrade to F28, terminal has started blinking where it used to highlight text, has there been any changes to /usr/share/terminfo/l/linux ?
May 29 10:56:26 <gsgatlin>	Hi guys. I'm trying to update VirtualGL package in fedora and epel  today. I was able to run "fedpkg build" ok and I see it built correctly for master branch in koji. But when I run
May 29 10:56:26 <gsgatlin>	fedpkg update
May 29 10:56:26 <gsgatlin>	I get
May 29 10:56:26 <gsgatlin>	Unable to determine release from build: VirtualGL-2.5.2-1.fc29
May 29 10:56:26 <gsgatlin>	Cannot find release associated with build: VirtualGL-2.5.2-1.fc29, tags: ['f29']
May 29 10:56:26 <gsgatlin>	Any idea what I am doing wrong?
May 29 10:58:37 <ajax>	gsgatlin: you've done nothing wrong.
May 29 10:58:55 <ajax>	gsgatlin: f29 is rawhide atm, rawhide doesn't use bodhi, 'fedpkg update' simply isn't wired up for it.
May 29 10:59:09 <gsgatlin>	oic. ok.
May 29 10:59:22 <ajax>	this is, admittedly, a bad error message
May 29 12:14:51 <gsgatlin>	ajax: Thanks for your help.
May 29 12:45:03 <pgier>	eclipseo, jsmith, I need to update some of the existing prometheus libraries for the node exporter build, should I create bzs for these upgrades?
May 29 12:45:37 <pgier>	I ran scratch builds for two updates so far, and created PRs in pagure
May 29 12:45:45 <pgier>	for example here: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/golang-github-prometheus-client_model/pull-request/1
May 29 12:46:05 <jsmith>	pgier: Yeah, that's probably best, or at least email the current maintainer and point them at the PRs.
May 29 12:46:24 <jsmith>	pgier: Sometimes packagers don't notice that someone has filed a PR against one of their packages.
May 29 12:46:57 <pgier>	jsmith, ok, I'll email jchaloup and fpokorny
May 29 12:53:32 <RaphGro>	.any fale
May 29 12:53:33 <zodbot>	RaphGro: I have not seen fale.
May 29 13:18:54 <gnat42>	Hello, I have a package that is failing to build because of a new compile flag -Wunused-result, against some calls to write. Is it required to fix the software (as in does all software need to be compiled with that particular option in a package requirement?) or can I simply remove that flag?
May 29 13:27:39 <rdieter>	gnat42: pretty sure it's ok to just remove the problematic flag
May 29 13:28:22 <ajax>	i wish that warning understood the probably-older-than-i-am c idiom of casting to void
May 29 13:28:25 <rdieter>	gnat42: though, why exactly does a flag about warnings cause a  fatal error?
May 29 13:28:50 <rdieter>	hoping it's not something silly like -Werror
May 29 13:29:08 <gnat42>	../common/smtppass.c:557:13: warning: ignoring return value of 'write', declared with attribute warn_unused_result [-Wunused-result]
May 29 13:29:28 <gnat42>	oh.. hmm maybe that's not actually the issue
May 29 13:29:39 <rdieter>	gnat42: ok, that's not why it's failing indeed
May 29 13:31:51 <gnat42>	I will look deeper, I just looked at the last compile message and assumed it was the issue but forgot about parallel compilation etc
May 29 13:31:54 <gnat42>	thanks though
May 29 13:34:02 <rdieter>	gnat42: fwiw, if you're not already using %make_build (instead of manual: make %{?_smp_mflags}), I'd recommend you switch, it includes also -O, so that make output is better-ordered
May 29 13:47:40 <bowlofeggs>	bodhi-3.8.0 is deployed to production https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/docs/user/release_notes.html#v3-8-0
May 29 16:22:37 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: ping, hey, just wanted to check and see if you had a chance to add me to help maintain ppyton-pexpect this past weekend?
May 29 17:00:46 <gnat42>	rdieter: thanks, I wasn't so I've updated that
May 29 18:30:37 <eclipseo>	If a package is orphaned but still has an admin like this one https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/dnscrypt-proxy do I still need to follow the process of unretiring it?
May 29 18:33:46 <mizdebsk>	eclipseo, this package is not retired, so you can't unretire it
May 29 18:34:03 <eclipseo>	okay
May 29 18:34:28 <eclipseo>	thx
May 30 02:35:11 <juhp>	fidencio: hi
May 30 02:46:15 <fidencio>	juhp: hey, what's up?
May 30 02:49:36 <juhp>	fidencio: I am about to attach logs to the bug :)
May 30 02:53:51 <juhp>	fidencio: should I make them private? - I can see anything sensitive in the logs...
May 30 02:53:56 <juhp>	can't!
May 30 03:04:48 <fidencio>	juhp: please, make them private or send them via email to me
May 30 03:11:34 <fidencio>	juhp: sorry for the delay, I was on a meeting
May 30 03:11:58 <juhp>	fidencio: no worries - I already attached though
May 30 03:12:27 <juhp>	okay I make them private then
May 30 03:13:16 <juhp>	fidencio: okay done
May 30 04:34:25 <fidencio>	juhp: sorry, had to move to another meeting
May 30 04:34:45 <fidencio>	juhp: out of curiosity, do you have both sssd-kcm.socket and sssd-secrets.socket enabled?
May 30 04:34:52 <fidencio>	juhp: and started?
May 30 09:39:59 <halfline>	yselkowitz: hey i'm thinking about orphaning gnome-desktop
May 30 09:40:05 <halfline>	is that something you'd want to take ownership of ?
May 30 09:42:26 *	smooge wonders how much of the desktop would go away if that got retired
May 30 10:33:48 <kashyap>	puiterwijk++ Thanks for the Python unit test help elsewhere :-)

May 30 10:35:30 <luminoso>	rdieter: why is 18.04 kde apps so delayed ?
May 30 10:35:34 <luminoso>	any particular reason?
May 30 10:36:26 <rdieter>	luminoso: I believe they're all in rawhide.  delayed for f28 you mean?
May 30 10:37:05 <rdieter>	if so, lack of time mostly.
May 30 10:40:07 <luminoso>	upx wrong channel sorry
May 30 10:40:12 <luminoso>	rdieter: indeed. thank you
May 30 10:41:02 <luminoso>	i didn't saw it on bodhi

May 30 10:56:32 <Pharaoh_Atem>	wut
May 30 10:56:42 <pingou>	it happens
May 30 12:11:29 <fidencio>	juhp: btw, workaround provided by Lorenzo will work for you, but I'll be back to the point that I have no reproducer for the issue :-/
May 30 12:12:08 <juhp>	fidencio: do the logs help at all
May 30 12:13:19 <juhp>	fidencio: I probably should have waited then 😬
May 30 12:13:53 <juhp>	Maybe I should have backed up my files
May 30 12:39:17 <fidencio>	juhp: well, the logs told me that you had a credential in the cache that didn't match to the searched
May 30 12:39:25 <fidencio>	juhp: I fail to understand why :-(
May 30 12:39:36 <fidencio>	juhp: which version of SSSD you're using?
May 30 12:39:50 <juhp>	yeah - some kind of data corruption?
May 30 12:40:01 <fidencio>	juhp: did you get to that state after a fresh install?
May 30 12:40:12 <juhp>	sssd-1.16.1-8.fc28.x86_64
May 30 12:40:17 <juhp>	no
May 30 12:40:30 <juhp>	It happened "suddenly" the other night
May 30 12:40:34 <fidencio>	juhp: yep, seems so. not sure where though.
May 30 12:40:55 <fidencio>	juhp: one last test that I'd like to see is restarting secrets and kcm sockets
May 30 12:40:58 <juhp>	fidencio: is there an easy way to reset the cache?
May 30 12:41:07 <fidencio>	klist -A :-)
May 30 12:41:12 <juhp>	ah
May 30 12:41:40 <juhp>	didn't i restart them already?
May 30 12:41:48 <fidencio>	juhp: you restarted the services
May 30 12:41:52 <juhp>	ah
May 30 12:42:51 <juhp>	I am afraid someone helped me earlier to delete the fake ticket... I assumed wrongly perhaps they were working from your team
May 30 12:43:15 <juhp>	(using su and curl...)
May 30 12:43:33 <fidencio>	juhp: hmm. you can do that as well, that will remove it from the secrets database
May 30 12:43:39 <juhp>	I see
May 30 12:43:51 <fidencio>	juhp: and I meant kdestroy -A, sorry
May 30 12:43:55 <fidencio>	juhp: /me needs more coffee
May 30 12:44:02 <juhp>	ah okay - no worries
May 30 12:44:29 <juhp>	well if it happens again I can provide more details or even send you data if you want
May 30 12:44:41 <juhp>	though seems it is quite rare
May 30 12:45:00 <fidencio>	juhp: sure, if it happens again and you have the time to debug the issue ... please, let me know and we can do a live debug session
May 30 12:45:19 <fidencio>	juhp: and sorry that we blocked you for a while :-/
May 30 12:45:27 <juhp>	It is more I couldn't use krb for 2 days since I didn't know how to clear the problem
May 30 12:45:31 <juhp>	It's okay
May 30 12:45:35 <juhp>	appreciate you help
May 30 12:45:44 <juhp>	Sure, happy to
May 30 12:46:17 <juhp>	Sorry for losing the breakage :-|
May 30 12:52:29 <tibbs>	Hmm, some bit of environment-modules has gotten chatty:
May 30 12:52:35 <tibbs>	 /usr/share/Modules/init/sh:36: no such file or directory: eval LD_LIBRARY_PATH='' /usr/bin/tclsh
May 30 12:53:55 <tibbs>	Obviously I don't have tcl installed, but I'm not sure what actually triggers that code to actually be executed.
May 30 12:54:45 <tmz>	tibbs: Are you running a bash script with -x and seeing that?
May 30 12:54:48 <tibbs>	It doesn't happen at shell startup, but seems to happen when I run scripts.
May 30 12:55:32 <tibbs>	I'm seeing it on a simple zsh script, no -x in sight, but that script of course calls other things.
May 30 12:56:07 <tmz>	might be worth trying to set MODULES_SILENT_SHELL_DEBUG=1 and see if that changes it.
May 30 12:56:32 <tmz>	For bash, the output was only verbose when -x was in effect.  But the output is quite verbose.
May 30 12:57:36 <tmz>	It came up on the users list. I filed https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1578587 for RHEL since scl-utils pulls in environment-modules and the change in output was surprising.
May 30 12:58:14 <tibbs>	That doesn't change anything.
May 30 12:59:15 <tibbs>	The error is valid, actually, since I don't have tcl installed.  There's an eval there and I guess it either needs to check that /usr/bin/tclsh exists first, or redirect stderr.
May 30 12:59:23 <tmz>	You might be seeing the minimum output then.  Without MODULES_SILENT_SHELL_DEBUG it's absurdly verbose (as it hijacks -x as if you wanted to debug environment-modules)
May 30 13:00:03 <tibbs>	Note that line is the only extraneous output I get.
May 30 13:02:45 <tibbs>	Of course, when I run the script with zsh -x, I don't get that output at all.
May 30 13:04:34 <tibbs>	Sadly I only have environment-modules installed because Macaulay2 requires it.  This issue appears to be new with F28.
May 30 13:39:15 <nirik>	rdieter: qt5-qtwayland didn't get rebuilt? looks like it got a commit, but I don't see a build...
May 30 13:53:45 <RaphGro>	nirik: does it use private api?
May 30 13:54:02 <nirik>	no idea
May 30 13:54:51 <RaphGro>	hm, qt5-qtwayland is not listed in koschei, so I can't tell either.
May 30 14:15:25 <rdieter>	nirik: thx, I'll take a look
May 30 14:15:42 <nirik>	it looks like it needs a patch1 removed
May 30 14:15:53 <nirik>	so it likely never built src.rpm because of the error
May 30 14:19:04 <rdieter>	gotten into the habit of using %autosetup everywhere so I don't look for %patch statements
May 30 14:20:30 <rdieter>	found a couple other modules not built yet either (qt5-qt3d qt5-qtwebview)
May 30 14:22:39 <nirik>	yeah, autosetup is nice. ;)
May 30 14:34:41 *	RaphGro crosses fingers
May 30 14:48:17 <grift>	this looks interesting: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/JZBQRCFD6CYPLCYU23J5F424WLZAUF6X/

May 30 17:13:03 <tibbs>	Conveniently it has no bugs... because the EOL process closes them all.
May 30 17:52:40 <zaccanasta>	where to ask for this warning: readelf: Gap in build notes detected from 0x... to 0x...
May 30 18:12:25 <zaccanasta>	is it about annobin stuff in fedora? the offenfing library is LibRaw
May 30 18:14:21 <zaccanasta>	*offending
May 30 18:14:24 <smooge>	zaccanasta, I would probably gather the data on how and where you got it with a copy of where the error occurs and send it to the fedora devel list
May 30 18:15:06 <zaccanasta>	i found this: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1546608
May 30 18:16:33 <smooge>	zaccanasta, I am not sure who is 'around' who might be able to help as it after usual ajax hours
May 30 18:17:38 <zaccanasta>	smooge: it's a warning from cmake when building my package, compilation goes ok, I don't know what it is and if it can cause problems (a crash?)
May 30 18:45:30 <ajax>	my spidey sense says that message is harmless, but i don't honestly know neither am i probably the person to ask
May 30 18:46:24 <ajax>	but yes, pretty sure that's annobin-related
May 30 19:03:41 <smooge>	ajax, ok sorry I saw LibRaw and thought.. X
May 30 19:15:19 <zaccanasta>	thanks guys anyway
May 30 20:15:06 <sdgathman>	The f28 branch of cjdns is broken.  I want to make it just like master (I can build working f28 binaries from master branch).
May 30 20:16:20 <sdgathman>	I had reverted to v19.1 on f28 - but the branching for f28 had already picked up v20.1 and published it.
May 30 20:17:17 <sdgathman>	I now have v20.2 working on f28.  Should I try to ditch the history and lookup the git voodoo to just point f28 branch at HEAD of master?
May 30 20:17:33 <sdgathman>	Or do we want a big patch to "make it like master" and keep the history?
May 30 20:17:43 <tibbs>	You can't not keep the history.
May 30 20:17:44 <sdgathman>	(And how do I do that in git?)
May 30 20:18:59 <sdgathman>	I tried git merge, but it was a disaster.
May 30 20:19:11 <tibbs>	fedpkg switch-branch f27
May 30 20:19:17 <tibbs>	git checkout master -- cjdns.spec
May 30 20:19:31 <sdgathman>	f27 is fine, I presume you mean f28
May 30 20:19:32 <tibbs>	That gives you the specfile from rawhide in f27.
May 30 20:20:05 <sdgathman>	Why just cjdns.spec?  The patch files need to be like master also.
May 30 20:20:08 <tibbs>	Or, you know, just switch to master, copy the spec to /tmp, switch to f27, copy it from /tmp.  Same difference, except that the git method will stage the changes for you.
May 30 20:20:22 <tibbs>	Because I have no idea what patches you have.
May 30 20:20:29 <tibbs>	So, you know, check them out too if you want them.
May 30 20:20:44 <sdgathman>	I need to make everything in the branch like master.
May 30 20:21:07 <sdgathman>	So that would be: fedpkg switch-branch f28; git checkout master
May 30 20:21:16 <sdgathman>	And that would do all the files?
May 30 20:21:50 <sdgathman>	I guess I can try it and just not commit if it isn't what I want...
May 30 20:21:55 <tibbs>	I've no idea.  Nothing matters unless you push.
May 30 20:24:18 <tibbs>	Maybe git checkout master -- .
May 30 20:24:26 <tibbs>	Honestly I've never tried it.
May 30 20:24:56 <sdgathman>	I just did git checkout master
May 30 20:24:57 <sdgathman>	no args
May 30 20:25:11 <sdgathman>	git diff master now shows no diffs
May 30 20:25:19 <sdgathman>	Now doing a build for f28
May 30 20:25:30 <tibbs>	But that's the same as doing "fedpkg switch-branch master".
May 30 20:25:46 <sdgathman>	I see
May 30 20:26:22 <tibbs>	My shell prompt automatically shows me the status of any git repository I'm in, so it makes these things kind of obvious.
May 30 20:26:30 <sdgathman>	Your way seems to work.
May 30 20:27:02 <sdgathman>	I'm now still in f28, and git diff master shows no changes
May 30 20:27:06 <sdgathman>	Thanks
May 30 20:27:21 <sdgathman>	And that wierdness is logged?
May 30 20:27:42 <tibbs>	git status should show that it staged but did not commit all of the differences between f28 and master.
May 30 20:27:57 <tibbs>	Or just install tig, run tig, and see the staged changes.
May 30 20:28:13 <sdgathman>	I'm committing the changes locally - it shows that it updated everything I expected.
May 30 20:30:04 <sdgathman>	Yea, git log shows everything - even though the last entry is just HEAD -> f28
May 30 20:30:47 <sdgathman>	git is cool - I don't always understand it, but the more I learn, the more it just does the right thing.
May 30 20:30:57 <tibbs>	I basically never understand it.
May 30 20:31:32 <tibbs>	But having a proper shell prompt and and tig handy at least makes it possible to see what's happening.
May 30 20:36:35 <sdgathman>	As I understand it, it just pointed f28 at the same commit as master, no diffs needed, but that transaction is logged.  Efficient and perfect.
May 30 20:37:54 <sdgathman>	It builds locally (and runs self test in build).  I'm going to push and try building for all arches.  (Since it was so easy to just point at a commit)
May 30 20:38:32 <tibbs>	That's pretty much it, but of course there's as much of a diff as there ever is.
May 30 20:38:46 <sdgathman>	Yeah, but computed, not stored.
May 30 20:39:22 <juhp>	fidencio: well I got the error again!
May 30 20:39:57 <juhp>	So maybe won't be that hard for me to reproduce ;o)
May 30 20:40:08 <tibbs>	Whether it's computed or stored isn't really something you have control over.  And it can change over time anyway.
May 30 20:40:47 <sdgathman>	Imagining that it just stores a pointer helps my understanding in any case.
May 30 20:41:45 <tibbs>	But the nice thing is it now knows that master and f28 have the same actual commit.  I don't know if it would have figured that out from just committing the equivalent diff (though I suspect it would have).
May 30 20:44:06 <sdgathman>	By the way, I was forced to abandon libsodium for cjdns >= 20, as they started using internal nacl APIs.  Their embedded nacl does not support os390x.  So I excluded it.  How big a problem is that?
May 30 20:44:21 <sdgathman>	Are the os390x people going to be mad at me?
May 30 20:44:47 <tibbs>	Just file the appropriate ticket and block the arch tracker.
May 30 20:45:07 <sdgathman>	You mean, create a bugzilla?
May 30 20:45:36 <tibbs>	Yes, and when you do, add this bug to the "Blocks" field: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=F-ExcludeArch-s390x
May 30 20:46:41 <tibbs>	It's not expected that you will port software to a mainframe, but maybe someone with access to said mainframe will want to know about the issue and might want to fix it.
May 30 20:46:53 <sdgathman>	ok
May 30 20:47:21 <sdgathman>	I'm tempted to buy myself a ppc64 system ...
May 30 20:48:38 <tibbs>	You can easily get access to one if you want to try something out, of coruse.
May 30 20:49:14 *	airlied isn't sure they are that buyable either
May 30 20:50:16 <sdgathman>	They are, but want Apple prices.
May 30 20:51:52 <sdgathman>	How is it that bodhi shows cjdns-19.1 as the last release for f28, but the fedora repo has cjdns-20.1 (which doesn't work)?
May 30 20:52:26 <sdgathman>	Maybe bodhi shows only updates I've built?
May 30 21:01:08 <sdgathman>	tibbs: ppc is a cool arch - just not cool enough for me to fork over $3000+ for a desktop at the moment.
May 30 21:01:58 <sdgathman>	I'm used to buying used Intel at the retropc store...
May 30 21:07:52 <DrNick>	hey, that's unfair to Apple
May 30 21:08:06 <DrNick>	Macs cost lest and come with advanced features like a disk controller
May 30 23:26:04 <sdgathman>	tibbs: is this good?  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1584480
May 31 00:03:11 <juhp>	What does mailman mean by "Message contains administrivia"??
May 31 00:04:26 <juhp>	ah I see, means it mistook my post as a mailman command or something
May 31 04:52:15 <erAck>	I thought F26 EOL is *tomorrow*? already today I can't push an update to Batched
May 31 05:07:06 <tomhughes>	no, it was Tuesday

**** BEGIN LOGGING AT Thu May 31 12:02:14 2018

May 31 12:02:14 *	Now talking on #fedora-devel
May 31 12:02:14 *	Topic for #fedora-devel is: Fedora developers channel | end users: please ask for help in #fedora | Infra status http://status.fedoraproject.org/ | s390x now in primary koji for rawhide
May 31 12:02:14 *	Topic for #fedora-devel set by dgilmore (Fri Apr 28 18:02:05 2017)
May 31 12:24:21 <sdgathman>	So cjdns-20.2-1 is in Testing, and I now have cjdns-20.2-2 (with s390x support).  Do I go ahead and just add a new testing release?
May 31 12:25:05 <sdgathman>	Do I Unpush cjdns-20.2-1 first?
May 31 12:29:43 <tomhughes>	you can just edit the update and change the build and it that will cause the testing period to be reset
May 31 12:50:23 <tomhughes>	I think you just broke the nodejs world jsmith ;-)
May 31 12:50:52 <jsmith>	tomhughes: Doh!
May 31 12:50:59 <jsmith>	tomhughes: The nodejs-tape update?
May 31 12:51:07 <tomhughes>	actually I think it's mostly just tape that needs an update for resolve
May 31 12:51:28 <tomhughes>	but lots of things use tape for testing so koschei suddenly started screaming
May 31 12:51:29 <jsmith>	tomhughes: Yeah, waiting for resolve to hit the build repo to start the new build of nodejs-tape :-)
May 31 12:52:15 <jsmith>	tomhughes: Just hit the repo, new nodejs-tape is building now :-)
May 31 12:57:53 <jsmith>	tomhughes: New nodejs-tape just finished building in Rawhide... hopefully that makes Koschei happy :-)
May 31 13:00:53 <jsmith>	tomhughes: Please let me know if you're seeing additional breakage
May 31 13:14:03 <tomhughes>	well I just got 98 "back to normal emails" which is about the same number of fails that I got before...
May 31 15:41:01 <tibbs>	Is there any point in setting %_hardened_build these days?
May 31 15:41:16 <rdieter>	tibbs: no, it's set by default iirc
May 31 15:41:19 <tibbs>	Or at least setting it to 1?
May 31 15:41:51 <tibbs>	I still see packages setting it to 1 manually, which seems mostly pointless.
May 31 15:42:39 <tibbs>	Then again, so are plenty of other things which stick around in specfiles.
May 31 15:43:08 <axk4545>	tibbs: yes to that second point
May 31 15:43:20 <axk4545>	from the little I have seen.
May 31 15:45:13 <tibbs>	Crowning achievement for the day is getting a message from Reindl or whatever his name is telling me I'm "completely wrong".  I should hang it on my wall.
May 31 15:47:15 <rdieter>	tibbs++
May 31 15:47:17 <zodbot>	rdieter: Karma for tibbs changed to 5 (for the f28 release cycle):  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/tags/cookie/any
May 31 15:48:08 <tibbs>	Ugh, emacs still has a single-threaded build process.
May 31 15:48:08 <axk4545>	tibbs: who?
May 31 15:48:36 <tibbs>	axk4545: "Reindl or whatever his name is"
May 31 15:49:00 <axk4545>	tibbs: yes. are they part of Fedora?
May 31 15:49:17 *	nirik wonders if he will be at flock. I think he is in germany... 
May 31 15:49:58 <tibbs>	Not sure what you define as being a part of Fedora, but he must at least be subscribed to the devel list because he responded to a message sent there.
May 31 15:50:11 <axk4545>	ah.
May 31 15:51:42 <nirik>	he's subscribed/gets posts, but cannot himself post from his normal email at least.
May 31 15:52:32 <nirik>	often though he replies to people directly with the list cc'ed... and people reply back to the list.
May 31 15:54:23 <tibbs>	I just have him killfiled on the lists anyway.  But not my personal email, and he likes to yell at people on bugzilla as well.
May 31 15:54:54 <tibbs>	I may just write a greasemonkey extension for that.
May 31 15:54:55 <axk4545>	tibbs: killfiled?
May 31 15:55:02 <tibbs>	Yes, killfiled.
May 31 15:55:21 <axk4545>	tibbs: what is that?
May 31 15:55:33 <tibbs>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_file
May 31 16:02:50 <nirik>	I've actually resisted having one of those, but sometimes the temptation is high. :)
May 31 16:03:23 <tibbs>	I use Gnus so technically it just learns who I don't want to see.
May 31 16:06:41 <tibbs>	Hooray, only 21 minutes to build emacs on a machine with 10 CPUs.
May 31 16:08:02 <tibbs>	Now, I remember when it was 21 hours, so I guess I shouldn't be complaining.
May 31 16:14:00 <DrNick>	the end result is still emacs, though
May 31 16:14:21 <tibbs>	I have emacs and vim open right next to each other.
May 31 16:18:38 <tmz>	tibbs: That sort of does sound "completely wrong". ;)
May 31 16:19:09 <tmz>	Speaking of emacs, do any emacs users here use the git support which comes from the git package (git.el and git-blame.el)?
May 31 16:19:31 <tibbs>	I don't even have emacs in vim mode.  Switching back and forth between two completely different sets of key bindings.  Next level stuff here.
May 31 16:19:43 <tmz>	Those have long been rotting and most users seem to have moved to the builtin vc-git and vc-annotate or Magit.
May 31 16:20:11 <tmz>	Upstream is dropping those file, replacing them with stubs which just print a message to move to one of the alternatives.
May 31 16:20:36 <tibbs>	Probably a good idea.
May 31 16:20:49 <tibbs>	I don't really use emacs for anything besides email (which is probably even more wrong).
May 31 16:20:57 <tmz>	I'm not an emacs user, so I'm hoping that most users have already moved on and won't even notice the change.
May 31 16:21:28 <tibbs>	But I keep saying that I will try to set up a dev environment, or spacemacs or somesuch just to see how it compares with my vim setup.
May 31 16:21:57 <tmz>	tibbs: I've got a two-decade mutt habit under my belt, so I'm not one to comment on what's wrong for reading email. :)
May 31 16:23:15 <tibbs>	Knowing how most people set these things up and then forget about them, I would have to assume that people are still using those el files from the git package.
May 31 16:24:07 <tibbs>	But this is Fedora; drop them in rawhide now and you'll get the flames the day of the F29 release.
May 31 16:24:09 <tomhughes>	I use vc mostly because that's the default...
May 31 16:24:26 <tomhughes>	well that and it works with svn as well so I don't have to remember which I'm using
May 31 16:24:31 <tmz>	That's sort of why I asked when I saw chatter on emacs, as I'm building some git-2.18.0-rc0 packages for local testing.
May 31 16:25:07 <nirik>	 REMINDER: there will be an outage starting at 21UTC for Fedora Infrastructure production openshift. This will affect bodhi, greenwave and waiverdb.
May 31 16:28:30 <tmz>	tomhughes: It'll be a bit before this change hits rawhide (I won't push git release candidates, I'll wait until a final version is released in a few weeks).
May 31 16:28:34 <tmz>	But if it works out badly and you remember -- now you know who to yell at about it.
May 31 16:28:53 <tibbs>	Well I generally use tig so I won't be complaining.
May 31 16:31:17 <tibbs>	I tried what I thought was the recommend vim interface (fugitive) but I found it just bizarre.
May 31 17:01:01 <tibbs>	Hmm, the EOL bug closer removed a lot of the old merge reviews.
May 31 17:01:47 <tibbs>	Those things have been around since something like F7; I have no idea why it would be auto-closing them now.
May 31 17:02:47 <tibbs>	It actually closed a number of review requests, too.  The scripts used to avoid the package-review component completely.  I guess that got broken.
May 31 17:48:24 <maxamillion>	is there a aarch64 machine anywhere that I can test something on?
May 31 17:48:50 <maxamillion>	I know there's these but none are aarch64 https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Machine_Resources_For_Package_Maintainers
May 31 17:50:22 <nirik>	right, there aren't any. Hopefully someday very soon, but not now.

Jun 04 08:29:28 *	Topic for #fedora-devel set by dgilmore (Fri Apr 28 18:02:05 2017)
Jun 04 10:13:38 <hh47>	
Jun 04 12:36:32 <emaldona>	mt: ping, I'm following https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1434943 and trying out your patch
Jun 04 13:51:15 <sdgathman>	I created an api-key on pagure.io, and configured it in ~/.config/rpkg/fedpkg.conf per wiki instructions.
Jun 04 13:51:40 <sdgathman>	But fedpkg request-repo still complains:
Jun 04 13:51:45 <sdgathman>	Could not execute request_repo: The following error occurred while creating a new issue in Pagure: Invalid or expired token. Please visit https://pagure.io/settings#api-keys to get or renew your API token.
Jun 04 13:52:32 <sdgathman>	Maybe I need more ACLs on the key than "Create repo"?
Jun 04 13:55:16 <sdgathman>	That was it.  I created a new key with all acls.
Jun 04 13:55:50 <sdgathman>	Where is it documented what ACLs are required for things?
Jun 04 14:06:15 <sdgathman>	Now that github is Microsoft, where should I keep public repos (not necessarily Fedora related)?  Back to sourceforge?  My own server?  Something in fedoraproject?
Jun 04 14:07:15 <mizdebsk>	sdgathman, pagure.io could be an alternative
Jun 04 14:07:45 <sdgathman>	It is not just for Fedora stuff?
Jun 04 14:07:46 <otaylor>	sdgathman: I don't think Microsoft owning github changes a lot ... it was a proprietary service, it's still a proprietary service
Jun 04 14:07:58 <xvitaly[m]>	sdgathman: You need only access to issues ACL to use repo-req.
Jun 04 14:08:03 <xvitaly[m]>	sdgathman: You can use Pagure.
Jun 04 14:08:24 <mizdebsk>	sdgathman, no, it's for anything, like github
Jun 04 14:09:02 <sdgathman>	otaylor: the problem with capitalism is when there are too few capitalists (G. K. Chesterton)
Jun 04 14:09:08 <xvitaly[m]>	otaylor: They can add integration with Microsoft Accounts, change UI, add cutom proprietary features, etc.
Jun 04 14:10:48 <otaylor>	certainly diversity is good - I just don't see that consolidating everything onto github was great, now microsoft owns it, it's awful. They are probably more constrained via public pressure than github would be
Jun 04 14:13:53 <sdgathman>	I was fine with proprietary with public api.  It is the big jump in centralization that concerns me.  Although in terms of percentage of internet traffic, google, facebook, and amazon are the 3 worst.
Jun 04 14:15:32 <sdgathman>	I'm going to implement automated local backups of public repos (which I should have done a while ago).
Jun 04 14:16:07 <xvitaly[m]>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish
Jun 04 14:23:06 <sdgathman>	Pagure looks like a good alternative.  Is there a Best Practices for moving a project and documenting the move on the old public platform?
Jun 04 14:23:24 <sdgathman>	I didn't do a very good job with sourceforge projects.
Jun 04 14:24:08 <xvitaly[m]>	SourceForge is dead.
Jun 04 14:29:22 <sdgathman>	pagure doesn't have a license tutorial on the create new project screen.
Jun 04 14:35:46 <sdgathman>	A dropdown with common free licenses and a "I'll add one later" option would be nice.
Jun 04 14:37:25 <nirik>	https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/1179
Jun 04 14:38:09 <sdgathman>	Is pagure restricted to free licenses?  Github protects themselves by defaulting to a github license (unless you pay for premium).
Jun 04 14:51:15 <bmeneg>	hey guys, quick question here, is there a problem to grep a proc file (during
Jun 04 14:51:19 <bmeneg>	oops
Jun 04 14:52:07 <bmeneg>	is there a problem to a rpm scriptlet %posttrans grep a proc file (cpuinfo) during distro installation?
Jun 04 14:53:06 <tibbs>	I'm not sure /proc is mounted into the chroot at package install time.
Jun 04 14:53:43 <tibbs>	I guess it might be; as to whether you can assume that information is correct and represents the system after booting.... I don't know.  It seems like a risk assumption to make.
Jun 04 14:55:03 <tibbs>	Really, you should probably avoid assuming too much about that.  It's not terribly uncommon to move an OS installation between different machines.
Jun 04 14:55:24 <tibbs>	bmeneg: Does any of that answer your question?
Jun 04 14:56:06 <bmeneg>	tibbs: yea, for sure.. I'll investigate such assumption
Jun 04 14:56:16 <bmeneg>	tibbs: tyvm
Jun 04 14:57:04 <ajax>	another option might be doing that check (whatever it is) in a wrapper script at runtime instead
Jun 04 14:57:43 <thm>	sdgathman: self-hosting using gitea would also be an option. easy.
Jun 04 14:57:47 <tibbs>	Yes, or depending on what you really need, using the weird thing glibc can do to bring in subarch-specific libraries depending on the subarch.
Jun 04 14:58:35 <bmeneg>	ajax: was that comment to my question? :)
Jun 04 15:08:25 <ajax>	bmeneg: yees
Jun 04 15:16:42 <bmeneg>	ajax: ah, yeah, that's actually an option.
Jun 04 17:59:40 <sdgathman>	So fedpkg push on the new mp3fs repo is giving me 403.  I've done ssh-add and kinit.  Do I need something else now?
Jun 04 18:06:58 <tibbs>	sgallagh: .... 403 as in the HTTP error code?
Jun 04 18:07:28 <sgallagh>	sdgathman: ^^
Jun 04 18:07:31 <tibbs>	HTTP isn't currently involved in pushing.  Are you sure you have done a non-anonymous checkout of the newly-created repository?
Jun 04 18:07:34 <nirik>	how new is the repo? sometimes it takes a few to have the acls regenerated.
Jun 04 18:07:37 <tibbs>	sgallagh: Sorry.
Jun 04 18:07:45 <sgallagh>	No worries.
Jun 04 18:07:55 <tibbs>	Tab completion fail.
Jun 04 18:08:21 <nirik>	indeed, tibbs is right there
Jun 04 18:08:23 <tibbs>	Or actually, didn't hit the 'd' key and then hit tab and the result was unique.
Jun 04 18:09:13 <tibbs>	If you did check out the new mp3fs repo, cd to it and grep url .git/config
Jun 04 18:09:19 <sgallagh>	It’s true, I am one of a kind.
Jun 04 18:09:29 <sgallagh>	(For which the world should probably be grateful)
Jun 04 18:10:22 <nirik>	note that https pushing is coming, but not quite in place yet.
Jun 04 18:10:58 <tibbs>	Yeah, I was careful to say "currently".
Jun 04 19:25:46 <sdgathman>	looks like my znc buffer was exceeded
Jun 04 19:30:35 <tibbs>	sdgathman: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/DMGbYeLIQ0dcea4jWAraYg
Jun 04 19:30:36 <SDGathman_>	.help
Jun 04 19:30:36 <zodbot>	Please see https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Zodbot for general help and information about this Supybot - If you want information about a specific command, type .misc help <command>
Jun 04 19:31:20 <sdgathman>	tibbs: thanks
Jun 04 19:33:26 <sdgathman>	tibbs: I think I may have checked it out before doing ssh-add/kinit
Jun 04 19:33:45 <tibbs>	Then you wouldn't have been able to do so.
Jun 04 19:33:57 <tibbs>	(and kerberos is not involved with git, only koji).
Jun 04 19:34:15 <tibbs>	Without the ssh key loaded, you'd just get a failure.
Jun 04 19:34:34 <tibbs>	But if you did an anonymous checkout then that would explain things.  Looking at the git config would tell you.
Jun 04 19:34:51 <sdgathman>	Ah, I used git clone instead of fedpkg clone
Jun 04 19:35:09 <tibbs>	Then you must have used an https:// url.
Jun 04 19:35:18 <tibbs>	Which is the same thing as fedpkg clone -a
Jun 04 19:35:35 <sdgathman>	So I'll remove and start over
Jun 04 19:36:06 <tibbs>	Really you just need the proper .git/config, if you had made local commits you don't want to lose.
Jun 04 19:37:53 <tibbs>	You can probably just run one git command to set the remote "origin" URL, or just edit the file, and then push.
Jun 04 19:38:11 <tibbs>	SHould look like url = ssh://tibbs@pkgs.fedoraproject.org/rpms/mp3fs, except with your FAS ID instead of mine.
Jun 04 19:38:14 <sdgathman>	I edited config to match other projects.
Jun 04 19:38:20 <sdgathman>	Thanks, trying now.
Jun 04 19:40:17 <sdgathman>	I'm fine now.
Jun 04 19:40:30 <tibbs>	Yep, I see your commits.
Jun 04 19:44:51 <sdgathman>	Building for rawhide
Jun 04 19:46:46 <sdgathman>	Should I bump the release just to make Fedora version replace rpmfusion version?
Jun 04 19:47:19 <sdgathman>	And the comment could then mention moving from rpmfusion.
Jun 04 19:52:28 <tibbs>	Yes, that's a reasonable idea.
Jun 04 20:12:44 <sdgathman>	Am I doing it wrong issuing a fedpkg request-branch for each branch?  Does a person have to respond to each ticket?
Jun 04 20:13:55 <tibbs>	You just request each branch that you want.
Jun 04 20:14:28 <tibbs>	Yes, someone needs to process each one, but there's a tool for it so it's no big deal.
Jun 04 20:20:27 <sdgathman>	Maybe I can improve security.  Does a fuse filesystem have to run as root?
Jun 04 20:20:52 <sdgathman>	Is there a well secured fuse filesystem project I can look at as an example?
Jun 04 20:22:02 <tibbs>	My understanding was that running as root was kind of the point.
Jun 04 20:22:12 <tibbs>	Sorry, _NOT_ running as root was kind of the point.
Jun 04 20:24:06 <tibbs>	From the fuse(8) manpage:
Jun 04 20:24:08 <tibbs>	FUSE also aims to provide a secure method for non privileged users to create and mount their own filesystem implementations.
Jun 04 20:24:14 <sdgathman>	Looks like it is up to the admin.
Jun 04 20:24:57 <sdgathman>	I am running mine as root - but that is apparently a bad idea.
Jun 04 20:25:16 <sdgathman>	Maybe fstab has a way to specify the user to run a fuse filesystem as.
Jun 04 20:26:29 <sdgathman>	You do have to run as root to pass through access from an underlying unix filesystem.
Jun 04 20:27:23 <sdgathman>	Since mp3fs is read-only, it would probably be a good idea to run as a special user that has read access on the flac files being exported.
Jun 04 20:27:46 <sdgathman>	I'm not sure the package should do anything other than maybe mention it in a README
Jun 04 20:55:11 <sdgathman>	I've fixed my instance.
Jun 04 23:08:19 <sdgathman>	Do EPEL builds get automatic _hardened_build ?
Jun 04 23:15:02 <tibbs>	sdgathman: Not to my knowledge.  Technically we could force it for EPEL, but... that's more of a question for the EPEL folks.
Jun 05 00:28:15 <gnat42>	supposed I wanted the latest poppler library on C7. I started trying to get the poppler srpm but it needs cmake 3 and cmake 3 needs cmake-rpm-macros. Is there a better way?
Jun 05 08:13:43 <bkabrda>	puiterwijk: hi, if you have some time, could you please have a look at https://pagure.io/ipsilon/issue/302 ? it's a bug that I found in ipsilon and the second comment has a patch (I think) - I'd like to hear what you think about it
Jun 05 08:16:48 <puiterwijk>	bkabrda: will look in a fw
Jun 05 08:16:50 <puiterwijk>	few
Jun 05 08:17:13 <bkabrda>	puiterwijk: I'll probably go offline in couple of minutes, so let's keep discussing in that issue
Jun 05 08:17:18 <bkabrda>	thanks
Jun 05 08:19:57 <puiterwijk>	bkabrda: your patch looks really great, thanks for the debugging!
Jun 05 10:06:45 <mattdm>	I'm adding VARIANT_ID to os-release for labs, spins, and other deliverables beyond the editions....
Jun 05 10:06:48 <mattdm>	See https://pagure.io/fork/mattdm/fedora-release/blob/master/f/fedora-release.spec
Jun 05 10:07:15 <mattdm>	This means a lot of repetition for each spec file.
Jun 05 10:07:36 <mattdm>	Would it be better or worse to create a macro which expands to a whole subpackage?
Jun 05 10:07:50 <mattdm>	tibbs: sgallagh thought you might have an opinion here :)
Jun 05 10:10:13 <sgallagh>	mattdm: The glibc package basically does this with lua for creating langpacks
Jun 05 10:10:18 <sgallagh>	So that's kind of a precedent?
Jun 05 10:10:46 <mattdm>	oh yay more lua :)
Jun 05 10:11:53 <mattdm>	holy $deity. I didn't realize you could do that.
Jun 05 10:17:27 <mattdm>	Also, unrelated: Docker is amazing for testing something like this.
Jun 05 10:18:11 <mattdm>	sgallagh: Here's the semantics question. Are we sure we want it to stay non-variant the first time a variant subpackage is installed?
Jun 05 10:19:35 <ignatenkobrain>	mattdm: you don't have to use lua
Jun 05 10:19:52 <ignatenkobrain>	Just simple macro would do the job
Jun 05 10:21:49 <mattdm>	There are basically four parameters....
Jun 05 10:22:14 <mattdm>	name, Pretty Name, whether it's an edition ("product"), and whether it has presets
Jun 05 10:22:39 <mattdm>	It seems like maybe it gets complicated as a macro with that
Jun 05 10:23:00 <sgallagh>	mattdm: also possibly Requires:
Jun 05 10:23:22 <sgallagh>	(Server has some Requires: to indicate a minimum level of functionality to continue calling itself Server Edition)
Jun 05 10:23:32 <mattdm>	oh, yeah. I forgot we put that here too.
Jun 05 10:23:43 <sgallagh>	That's open to renegotiation
Jun 05 10:24:15 <sgallagh>	But I kind of liked how "dnf remove firewalld" would mean that it no longer reported as Server Edition
Jun 05 10:24:15 <tomhughes>	the lodash package does similar crazy lua...
Jun 05 10:24:38 <ignatenkobrain>	sgallagh: so like package based comps? Finally in 2018?
Jun 05 10:24:49 <mattdm>	sgallagh: yeah, I like that too. except....
Jun 05 10:24:56 <mattdm>	ignatenkobrain: yeah, except we also don't get rid of comps :)
Jun 05 10:26:07 <ignatenkobrain>	mattdm: facepalm
Jun 05 10:27:44 <sgallagh>	mattdm: I think we had opted to stay as non-edition to 1) make it clear that if you started as roll-your-own-distro, it remains that way and 2) To avoid situations where installing some comps group ends up changing how the system reports itself as a side-effect
Jun 05 10:28:29 <sgallagh>	It's probably negotiable, but I have a slight preference to not having unexpected side-effects.
Jun 05 10:37:35 <mattdm>	sgallagh: Hmmm. I feel like installing the subpackage and it *not* changing is *more* surprising.
Jun 05 10:38:01 <sgallagh>	mattdm: Except that it *must* occur that way when the variant is already set
Jun 05 10:38:28 <sgallagh>	(Representative example: someone installs Server and then does `dnf install @workstation` to get a GNOME environment.
Jun 05 10:38:46 <sgallagh>	That would pull in fedora-release-workstation but must *not* change the configuration of the system
Jun 05 10:39:14 <sgallagh>	So I'd prefer that it behave the same way for a non-Edition install
Jun 05 10:39:39 <sgallagh>	which is why we previously had the convert-to-edition.sh tool; so people could force it to change if they really intended it.
Jun 05 10:39:46 <sgallagh>	(As far as I know, it was never used)
Jun 05 10:40:21 <sgallagh>	mattdm: Remember that changing the installed variant may have other effects.
Jun 05 10:40:56 <mattdm>	in that case, you'd have two variant-definition subpackages, which gets into other questions. Maybe they should conflict?
Jun 05 10:41:12 <sgallagh>	For example, it would change the default firewall state of the system, which might be alarming if one switched from non-edition (which has a restrictive firewall default) to GNOME, which is very permissive
Jun 05 10:41:36 <sgallagh>	They can't conflict or else you end up being unable to install GNOME on Server Edition easily
Jun 05 10:41:51 <sgallagh>	Or at least without having to create new comps groups specifically for that case
Jun 05 10:41:54 <mattdm>	I feel like that's a *feature* not a bug, but I see the point
Jun 05 10:42:00 <sgallagh>	(which people would ignore)
Jun 05 10:42:37 <sgallagh>	mattdm: Unfortunately, there's plenty of third-party server software that *still* in 2018 requires a GUI installer.
Jun 05 10:44:20 <mattdm>	Isn't the fundamental problem there that we don't have a separate "gnome desktop" that isn't Workstation?
Jun 05 10:44:25 <sgallagh>	mattdm: FYI, https://sgallagh.wordpress.com/2016/03/18/sausage-factory-multiple-edition-handling-in-fedora/ may have some useful insights
Jun 05 10:44:51 <sgallagh>	mattdm: We intentionally scrubbed the former to reduce confusion on netinstall media (and with good reason)_
Jun 05 10:45:00 <mattdm>	anyway, I'm going to stick with keeping it how it is for now.
Jun 05 10:45:25 <mattdm>	ignatenkobrain: do you still think a regular macro is best or considering the Requires and etc. should I go with lua?
Jun 05 10:46:05 *	sgallagh needs to pay attention to the class now for a bit.
Jun 05 10:46:06 <sgallagh>	Back later
Jun 05 10:46:47 <mattdm>	hmmm also since there are blocks like this:
Jun 05 10:46:53 <mattdm>	%post workstation -p <lua>
Jun 05 10:46:55 <mattdm>	%include %{_sourcedir}/convert-to-variant.lua
Jun 05 10:46:57 <mattdm>	install_variant("workstation")
Jun 05 10:47:06 <mattdm>	doing it all in lua would simplify.
Jun 05 11:00:57 <ignatenkobrain>	mattdm: depends on you. I usually don't do lua
Jun 05 11:06:35 <sharkcz>	crobinso: hi, the virt-preview copr is the official place now, right? because https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Virtualization_Preview_Repository still points to the fedorapeople page
Jun 05 11:07:01 <crobinso>	sharkcz: yeah I've been lazy about announcing it, but it should be working
Jun 05 11:07:15 <sharkcz>	crobinso: it is, tested on f28 ppc64le :-)
Jun 05 11:07:27 <crobinso>	sharkcz: cool good to hear :)
Jun 05 11:19:43 <tibbs>	mattdm: Not entirely sure of the context.
Jun 05 11:20:20 <tibbs>	In general, though, excess repetition in specfiles just means "make a macro".  Lua or otherwise.
Jun 05 11:25:02 <tibbs>	And using %include kind of sucks.  The specfile itself can then no longer be parsed independently of the complete checkout.
Jun 05 12:00:40 <eclipseo>	.any   comzeradd
Jun 05 12:00:40 <zodbot>	eclipseo: I have not seen comzeradd.
Jun 05 13:59:56 <gagbo>	Hello, quick sanity check, is it possibly normal to require a *.so.0 file ? "nothing provides libnm.so.0(libnm_1_12_0)(64bit) needed by network-manager-applet-1.8.12-3.fc29.x86_64"
Jun 05 14:01:28 <DrNick>	yes
Jun 05 14:05:12 <gagbo>	thanks
Jun 05 14:11:20 <sdgathman>	How do you force python version for brp-python-bytecompile?
Jun 05 14:11:42 <tibbs>	You don't?
Jun 05 14:12:30 <sdgathman>	It wants to use system python, even if the python code is incompatible (e.g. 2 instead of 3 or 3 instead of 2)
Jun 05 14:13:13 <tibbs>	Try redefining %__python.
Jun 05 14:13:27 <tibbs>	%global __python %__python3
Jun 05 14:13:51 <tibbs>	Folks in #fedora-python would know better, probably.
Jun 05 14:14:25 <sdgathman>	That did it.  Thanks.
Jun 05 14:16:38 <tibbs>	Found by reading /usr/lib/rpm/brp-python-bytecompile and looking at rpm --showrc to see how it gets called.
Jun 05 14:17:05 <sdgathman>	thanks
Jun 05 14:17:19 <tibbs>	Note that soon (rawhide) it will stop bytecompiling anything outsideof the normal python library directories.
Jun 05 14:17:32 <tmz>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Avoid_usr_bin_python_in_RPM_Build#Quick_Opt-Out covers that.  I'm believe that will stop being needed when https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/No_more_automagic_Python_bytecompilation is done.
Jun 05 14:17:34 <sdgathman>	That will be fine with me.
Jun 05 14:17:44 <tmz>	Heh. I was too slow.
Jun 05 14:17:55 <tibbs>	I'm guessing your package isn't putting the python files in the proper place for python files.
Jun 05 14:18:25 <tibbs>	Otherwise they'd get compiled with the proper version of python for the location they're in.
Jun 05 14:18:27 <tmz>	If they're not meant to be shared libraries, it's not necessarily the wrong place.
Jun 05 14:18:28 <sdgathman>	It is a script, not a library.  It is going in %{_libexecdir}/textern
Jun 05 14:18:53 <sdgathman>	It has a #!/usr/bin/python3, which selects the needed python version.
Jun 05 14:18:54 <tibbs>	They you probably don't want it byte compiled at all.
Jun 05 14:18:58 <sdgathman>	Exactly.
Jun 05 14:19:06 <tibbs>	But it's probably named something.py.
Jun 05 14:19:26 <tibbs>	If was just named without .py it wouldn't be compiled at all.
Jun 05 14:19:29 <sdgathman>	Yeah, I could rename it - which requires more patching of upstream code.
Jun 05 14:19:53 <tibbs>	I've never understood why people name executables according to the language.
Jun 05 14:20:07 <tibbs>	Fortunately we don't have 'ls.c'.
Jun 05 14:21:04 <sdgathman>	Only script languages like bash,python,php,nodejs get such extensions.
Jun 05 14:21:08 <tibbs>	Interestingly, brp-python-bytecompile already ignores things under /bin or /sbin.
Jun 05 14:21:19 <tibbs>	sdgathman: Which is dumb.
Jun 05 14:21:32 <tibbs>	Why do I care what language something is in when I run it?
Jun 05 14:21:47 <sdgathman>	It makes it easier to tweak it with your editor.
Jun 05 14:21:54 <tibbs>	That's what #! is for.
Jun 05 14:22:01 <sdgathman>	Which is irrelevant when installed with a package, of course.
Jun 05 14:22:36 <tibbs>	Presumably I want the thing for its functionality and shouldn't be expected to care what language it's written in.
Jun 05 14:23:15 <sdgathman>	It believe it is a hack for development that doesn't get removed when packaging for general consumption.
Jun 05 14:23:23 <tibbs>	Anyway, obviously brp-python-bytecompile should be excluding libexec as well as bin and sbin.
Jun 05 14:24:58 <sdgathman>	tibbs: my python2-cjdns package actually puts a library used by the python tools there.  But it would be easy to convince me that was wrong, and move the library part to /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages
Jun 05 14:25:41 <sdgathman>	It doesn't hurt to byte compile *py script in libexec - saves a micro-second of startup time...
Jun 05 14:26:08 <cqs>	Hi, guys is there any chance that i successfully install obsolete ruby 1.9.3 on fedora 28 in rbenv? I'm getting some ssl errors even after patching from ruby-build git
Jun 05 14:27:43 <sdgathman>	I get: error: Empty %files file /home/stuart/rpm/BUILD/textern-b251d792a27814a486b0bf2d231caaa9a5d18c9f/debugfiles.list
Jun 05 14:27:53 <sdgathman>	There are no debugfiles.
Jun 05 14:28:05 <tibbs>	Are you sure your package is arch-dependent?
Jun 05 14:28:10 <sdgathman>	Yes
Jun 05 14:28:19 <sdgathman>	Oh, I forgot the noarch...
Jun 05 14:28:21 <sdgathman>	duh
Jun 05 14:28:31 <tibbs>	Then your package is most certainly not arch-dependent.
Jun 05 14:30:13 <sdgathman>	Do we package mozilla extensions?
Jun 05 14:30:47 <sdgathman>	With mozilla 57+, the javascript and native portions have to be installed separately.
Jun 05 14:31:07 <tibbs>	Probably no different than we package chrome extensions.
Jun 05 14:31:40 <sdgathman>	The javascript part can be installed from addons.mozilla.org - so no real need for the package.
Jun 05 14:32:16 <tibbs>	If you mean the native messaging host, you just put that in /usr/lib64/mozilla/native-messaging-hosts
Jun 05 14:32:35 <sgallagh>	sdgathman: Well, there's a trust question there: a user might trust content delivered by Fedora but not from addons.mozilla.org
Jun 05 14:32:36 <sdgathman>	Yes, but there is an extension as well.
Jun 05 14:32:38 <tibbs>	And in /etc/chromium/native-messaging-hosts, and in /etc/opt/chrome/native-messaging-hosts.
Jun 05 14:32:56 <tibbs>	Since generally extensions are rather cross-browser compatible these days.
Jun 05 14:33:24 <sdgathman>	sgallagh: so it might be worth offering a subpackage for the browser extension part.
Jun 05 14:33:45 <tibbs>	For an example, see chrome-gnome-shell or webextension-token-signing, I guess.
Jun 05 14:34:24 <sgallagh>	sdgathman: I'm not making a specific recommendation. Just pointing out that there are non-technical considerations
Jun 05 14:34:34 <tibbs>	The latter doesn't have any native messaging hosts.
Jun 05 14:34:42 <tibbs>	One package, three browsers, done.
Jun 05 14:35:03 <sdgathman>	sgallagh: well, I have to eat the dog food before inflicting on Fedora ...
Jun 05 14:35:04 <tibbs>	Well, technically the latter doesn't do the chrome thing, but it could.
Jun 05 14:35:24 <tibbs>	Wouldn't be a bad idea to have packaging guidelines for webextensions, I guess.
Jun 05 14:35:51 <tibbs>	Since there's already a specific exception to the 'don't use /opt' guideline in order to support Chrome.
Jun 05 14:41:45 <sdgathman>	A lot of web extension have to be rewritten to have a native part - so Fedora packages with the native part, and maybe the extension itself, would make things much easier for users.  (Other than they won't know to install the package ...)
Jun 05 14:42:25 <tibbs>	Nothing currently stops them from being packaged.
Jun 05 14:42:59 <tibbs>	So just do it if that's what you want to do.
Jun 05 14:43:18 <gnat42>	rdieter: you around by chance?
Jun 05 14:43:38 <sdgathman>	tibbs: I'm working on textern
Jun 05 14:43:58 <tibbs>	No idea what that is, but go for it.
Jun 05 14:43:59 <sdgathman>	that is the simplest, now that It's all text is defunct.
Jun 05 14:44:14 <sdgathman>	It lets you use an external editor in text fields.
Jun 05 14:44:41 <sdgathman>	I guess letting extensions run arbitrary native programs was too much of a security hazard . . .
Jun 05 14:44:54 <tibbs>	Well, uh, yeah.
Jun 05 14:45:17 <sdgathman>	So now you have to preconfigure the programs they run separately.
Jun 05 14:56:14 <tibbs>	When I do 'dnf repoquery -l foo', is there a way to tell it not to list the contents of every version of foo that exists in any repo?  Besides including the entire NEVR string?
Jun 05 14:56:53 <ajax>	--disablerepo=* --enablerepo=fedora ?
Jun 05 14:57:02 <sgallagh>	tibbs: --latest-limit=1 I think?
Jun 05 14:57:32 <tibbs>	ajax: I guess that would be good, except that it would show the oldest choice instead of the newest one.
Jun 05 14:57:52 <ajax>	then probably what sgallagh said
Jun 05 14:58:11 <tibbs>	sgallagh: Yeah, that does work.  But....
Jun 05 14:58:21 <sgallagh>	but?
Jun 05 14:58:43 <tibbs>	But the option is longer than the rest of the command.
Jun 05 14:58:48 <tibbs>	Just another "dnf thing".
Jun 05 14:59:57 <sgallagh>	🎻
Jun 05 15:01:01 <tibbs>	Another emoji that I don't have.
Jun 05 15:01:34 <tmz>	tibbs: You can take the lazy route and just use --latest (or even --lat, I think anything unique).
Jun 05 15:01:44 <sgallagh>	tibbs: I'm sure you can imagine it :)
Jun 05 15:10:41 <grift>	zoom in to see what it is... a guitar
Jun 05 15:14:19 <grift>	someone should sponsor termy-qt so that we can have emojii in irssi by default
Jun 05 15:15:12 <DrNick>	this is a guitar: 🎸, that's clearly a violin
Jun 05 15:15:40 <grift>	already solid: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/JZBQRCFD6CYPLCYU23J5F424WLZAUF6X/ just needs some blessing
Jun 05 16:02:55 <thm>	𝄞
Jun 05 16:30:42 <mattdm>	hey, so... how do lua scripts and rpm macros interact?
Jun 05 16:30:55 <mattdm>	There is an "rpm.expand()" call in the lua docs
Jun 05 16:31:06 <mattdm>	but looking in the %post scripts in https://pagure.io/fedora-release/blob/master/f/fedora-release.spec
Jun 05 16:31:19 <mattdm>	there is an %include, which clearly *works*
Jun 05 16:31:36 <mattdm>	does that mean *all* macros get expanded in the lua script? Do they need to be escaped?
Jun 05 16:44:09 <tomhughes>	mattdm: a lua post script is different to a %lua block as it runs at install time - a %lua block is evalated as part of spec expansion
Jun 05 16:44:34 <tomhughes>	a %lua block like https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/lodash/blob/master/f/lodash.spec#_110 needs to use rpm.expand to generate the spec file fragment
Jun 05 16:45:31 <mattdm>	tomhughes: hmmm.  the examples on http://rpm.org/user_doc/lua.html use "print"
Jun 05 16:45:36 <pjones>	you can use %{expand: ... } instead of using %lua for that
Jun 05 16:46:27 <mattdm>	I basically want to do a template for a bunch of subpackages, like the lodash example
Jun 05 16:46:34 <pjones>	mattdm: there is %include but "works" is... questionable.  it's easy to accidentally make "fedpkg mockbuild" and "fedpkg local" and "rpmbuild -ba foo.spec" wind up using different include paths.
Jun 05 16:46:36 <tomhughes>	mattdm: yes you print the text that will become part of the spec
Jun 05 16:46:47 <mattdm>	I see that example *does* escape "%%files"
Jun 05 16:47:00 <tomhughes>	what my bit does is expand a macro and then loop over it's value to generate the print output that will be the spec
Jun 05 16:47:19 <mattdm>	pjones: yeah, I'm going to try to get rid of the %include that's in the current fedora-release
Jun 05 16:47:39 <tomhughes>	I'm reading the file that %SOURCE5 points at and expanding the template for each line in that file and printing that expansion
Jun 05 16:48:23 <pjones>	mattdm: anyway look at https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/grub2/blob/master/f/grub.macros for another example
Jun 05 16:49:08 <pjones>	mattdm: specifically define_legacy_variant there
Jun 05 16:49:14 <mattdm>	pjones: thanks
Jun 05 16:50:30 <pjones>	mattdm: I don't know if it'll be relevant, but: don't use %ifarch inside one of those, it will mess you up.  aside from that, these days "rpmspec -P foo.spec" is really useful while trying to do this sort of thing.
Jun 05 16:50:59 <pjones>	and "--trace" (or adding %trace at any given point in the file to trace after that point) can help, but it's extraordinarily hard to read.
Jun 05 16:51:02 <mattdm>	okay, thanks :)
Jun 05 17:17:26 <mattdm>	sgallagh: hey, why doesn't the fedora-release-workstation package have "Requires(post): systemd"? Isn't that required for the presets?
Jun 05 17:18:15 <sgallagh>	Could be a bug.
Jun 05 17:19:09 <sgallagh>	Oh, I think they didn’t have any special presets initially. Probably it was overlooked later.
Jun 05 17:19:23 <mattdm>	I have an ... idea
Jun 05 17:19:44 <mattdm>	The presets, gschema override, and requires significantly complicate things
Jun 05 17:20:03 <mattdm>	What if those were in _separate_ packages?
Jun 05 17:21:32 <sgallagh>	The gschema stuff needs to be replaced with a trigger
Jun 05 17:21:50 <sgallagh>	I can’t talk now. Sorry.
Jun 05 17:21:56 <mattdm>	sgallagh: okay no problem :)
Jun 05 17:22:29 <mattdm>	can the systemd presets stuff *also* be replaced with a trigger?
Jun 05 17:27:27 <misc>	you mean a filetrigger ?
Jun 05 17:32:00 <mattdm>	misc: yes, I think so :)
Jun 05 17:45:23 <eclipseo>	nirik: when you hae some time: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/levien-inconsolata-fonts/pull-request/1
Jun 05 17:53:11 <nirik>	right, I was hoping to get them building, but it's been ages and I never had time, so I guess we can just update...
Jun 05 17:54:59 <Pharaoh_Atem>	mattdm: there's actually an implementation of a file trigger based one from OpenMandriva
Jun 05 17:55:41 <Pharaoh_Atem>	I've been meaning to rewrite it to be rpm.org rpm safe, since theirs relied on rpm5 specific functionality and they're migrating to rpm.org rpm and dnf for OpenMandriva Lx 4
Jun 05 17:55:41 <mattdm>	Pharaoh_Atem: that would reduce the level of insanity in the fedora-release-variant subpackages
Jun 05 17:55:52 <Pharaoh_Atem>	I mean, it would completely eliminate %systemd_post
Jun 05 17:55:55 <Pharaoh_Atem>	which would be _awesome_
Jun 05 17:57:04 <Pharaoh_Atem>	I already added a _ton_ of file triggers to kill off most of the macros/scriptlets we used before
Jun 05 17:58:37 <mattdm>	I have no actual idea how those work. I just know they exist. Would it be possible to replace the post scripts for changing the /usr/lib/os-release symlink to the proper file in /usr/lib/os.release.d?
Jun 05 17:58:48 <Pharaoh_Atem>	that would be complicated
Jun 05 17:58:57 <Pharaoh_Atem>	how would we divine the correct intent?
Jun 05 17:59:03 <Pharaoh_Atem>	are all the variants conflicting?
Jun 05 17:59:13 <Pharaoh_Atem>	that is, there can only be one that can be installed at a time?
Jun 05 17:59:54 <mattdm>	the current semantics are: multiple can be installed. first one installed "wins"
Jun 05 18:00:10 <mattdm>	I'm not... completely convinced on that. But there are reasonable people who are.
Jun 05 18:01:02 <gnat42>	I'm trying to build a package for el7, however the source needs a newer g++, I enabled scl and have a BR on devtoolset-6, but when it compiles it still uses the regular system one
Jun 05 18:02:30 <gnat42>	how should I make it compile? I was looking for RemiFedora since he has experience with this but I can't seem to get it working
Jun 05 18:08:42 <gnat42>	when I go into the mock shell and run the commands I can compile
Jun 05 18:09:15 <gnat42>	but I can't seem to get it in the spec file
Jun 05 18:25:01 <gnat42>	looks like I can set CXX to that path
Jun 05 18:37:05 <smooge>	gnat42, look at the chromium spec file.
Jun 05 18:37:17 <gnat42>	ok - thanks!

Jun 05 18:39:50 <gnat42>	thank you very much
Jun 05 18:44:49 <smooge>	no problem. if there are more problems let me know and I will update my docs
Jun 06 04:01:03 <Sagnik_chaudhuri>	 Hi. I am trying to build kdevelop from source and I am getting errors after I run "kdesrc-build kdevelop"
Jun 06 04:01:12 <Sagnik_chaudhuri>	I asked in the kde-devel channel.
Jun 06 04:01:34 <Sagnik_chaudhuri>	they said to install kf5 developer packages from Fedora
Jun 06 04:02:24 <Sagnik_chaudhuri>	They said that  maybe fedora has a meta package that pulls in all kf5-devel packages. I'll need to utilise my distro's package manager.
Jun 06 04:03:03 <Sagnik_chaudhuri>	How should I go about doing that?
Jun 06 04:58:40 <hannes|l>	I would like to confirm a suspicion I have. I am maintaining a package in fedora and upstream changed the name of the icon to a different one. The .desktop file was changed accordingly and basically all was good. Nevertheless, I noticed that after the update of the package the created shortcut in the xfce panel was not updated to the new icon, although in the menu all looked fine and after readding it to the panel it also
Jun 06 04:58:59 <hannes|l>	I am not sure if that's something I could address in the update or if this is an issue of xfce
Jun 06 05:27:26 <CustosLimen>	hi
Jun 06 05:27:32 <CustosLimen>	is this right place to ask about https://stratis-storage.github.io/ ?
Jun 06 05:27:52 <CustosLimen>	If so, will stratis implement object raid? It does not look like it
Jun 06 05:27:56 <CustosLimen>	but I'm not sure
Jun 06 05:28:34 <CustosLimen>	http://storagegaga.com/tag/object-raid/
Jun 06 06:09:45 <ignatenkobrain>	CustosLimen: better to ask on #stratis-storage
Jun 06 06:10:20 <CustosLimen>	thanks ignatenkobrain
Jun 06 06:10:29 <CustosLimen>	looked in alis but clearly did not look properly

Jun 06 10:49:14 <gnat42>	smooge: you around?
Jun 06 10:51:08 <smooge>	gnat42, I am sort of. Can you ask your question and I will try to answer when I get done with current fire?
Jun 06 10:51:32 <gnat42>	for sure - just looking for clarification on your blog post: https://smoogespace.blogspot.com/2018/03/using-red-hat-developer-toolset-dts-in.html
Jun 06 10:51:56 <smooge>	ok what kind of clarification?
Jun 06 10:52:13 <gnat42>	point #2 you say "If you are using mock/fedpkg, the scl.org repository should be available in the epel mock configs." however I can't get the devtoolset-6 installed without adding the following to my mock config
Jun 06 10:52:50 <gnat42>	https://pastebin.com/69MN0VY4
Jun 06 10:53:40 <gnat42>	so did I miss something?
Jun 06 10:59:09 <tmz>	gnat42: What version of mock-core-configs do you have?
Jun 06 10:59:14 <smooge>	http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/sclo/x86_64/rh/ shows a devtoolset-6 and devtoolset-7
Jun 06 11:00:46 <gnat42>	smooge: yeah when I add those configs it all works - but your blog post says that if using mock I don't need to do anything
Jun 06 11:00:55 <gnat42>	tmz: 28.4-1
Jun 06 11:01:37 <rdieter>	gnat42: smooge's blog is talking about epel-7 (koji), not mock
Jun 06 11:01:55 <tmz>	gnat42: The scl config should be in the epel-7 configs there, at least on x86_64.  Let me check the other arches -- they were added later.
Jun 06 11:02:26 <gnat42>	I'm using epel-7-x86_64 oh wait let me look
Jun 06 11:02:29 <tmz>	Yeah, that release includes them all.
Jun 06 11:02:34 <rdieter>	I guess it mentioned mock too
Jun 06 11:03:30 <smooge>	gnat42, you shouldn't need to do anything for it to build a package inside of mock
Jun 06 11:03:30 <tmz>	We added the scl repos to mock before they were in koji, so by now they should be available in both.
Jun 06 11:03:32 <gnat42>	ok here's the issue, I have copied the epel-7-x86_64.cfg because we had some other local repos to add
Jun 06 11:03:39 <gnat42>	I must have copied them before these were added
Jun 06 11:03:50 <gnat42>	when I look at the stock epel-7-x86_64 there are sclo repos
Jun 06 11:03:55 <tmz>	That would do it. :)
Jun 06 11:04:01 <gnat42>	definitely
Jun 06 11:04:07 <gnat42>	thanks a bunch everyone
Jun 06 11:04:28 <tmz>	Glad it was easy.

Jun 06 12:07:56 <tibbs>	With all of this work on happening on Grub and EFI magic, I wonder if there's any hope for getting a proper free EFI memtest program.
Jun 06 12:10:45 <tibbs>	I mean, there's the passmark one, but it's closed source.
Jun 06 12:12:03 <tibbs>	I guess porting the old memtest86+ to uefi is quite difficult, or else someone would have done it by now.
Jun 06 12:44:01 <pjones>	I think somebody has done it twice now and failed to publish the patches :/
Jun 06 12:44:04 <pjones>	but yeah, it's not trivial
Jun 06 12:44:26 <pjones>	probably take a week or two of just flat-out working on it, but there's definitely some tricky bits that you could get mired in
Jun 06 12:45:13 <pjones>	not least, making sure everything is quiescent enough to relocate EFI code and test that memory.
Jun 06 13:14:03 <tibbs>	pjones: I figured the simplest way would be to just get rid of EFI and own the machine, but it appears that the passmark stuff keeps EFI around somehow because it can still do filesystem access to write logs and such.
Jun 06 14:10:38 <tibbs>	Is there anyone here who runs firefox nightly and can confirm that is misrenders ansible documentation pages like https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/firewalld_module.html

Jun 06 15:37:19 <grift>	the fesco election articles
Jun 06 15:38:09 <grift>	you and till maas for packaging the others for modularity
Jun 06 15:41:01 <grift>	the way i see if modulatiry can wait, packaging needs some attention now

Jun 06 16:03:51 <jwb>	grift, i think they're complimentary and we don't need to pit them against each other
Jun 06 16:04:33 <grift>	yes but i am talking about the fesco articles and its one or the other there
Jun 06 16:07:21 <jwb>	grift, meaning candidates discuss one or the other?  that's fine.  it doesn't mean we can't do both or that they aren't complimentary.  it's just what the candidates focused on
Jun 06 16:07:41 <grift>	no candidates prioritize one or the other
Jun 06 16:08:21 <grift>	so in that regard i would vote for bowlofeggs/packaging
Jun 06 16:08:29 <jwb>	grift, i'm not seeing this in the articles i'm reading
Jun 06 16:08:35 <grift>	not saying one doesnt compilment the other
Jun 06 16:09:33 <jwb>	grift, the question is "what area needs to most improvement".  they picked one.  that doesn't mean both can't be done by different sets of people.  it's a weird way to look at the question and answer
Jun 06 16:09:37 <grift>	grep the 5 articles for "package" and "modul"
Jun 06 16:09:57 <jwb>	grift, right, but you're drawing a very bright line where one doesn't need to be drawn.
Jun 06 16:09:57 <grift>	"packag"
Jun 06 16:11:30 <grift>	well not quite but eventually only one can be the favority
Jun 06 16:11:31 <bowlofeggs>	yeah i don't think i am in disagreement with the other candidates around this point
Jun 06 16:11:45 <jwb>	grift, nope...
Jun 06 16:11:57 <grift>	me neither
Jun 06 16:12:03 <jwb>	grift, if everyone only worked on one thing, we'd never have new things.  and stuff like packaging is never "done".
Jun 06 16:12:10 *	jwb shrugs
Jun 06 16:12:58 <grift>	yes sure but i agree with bowlofeggs in that right now that could use some attention
Jun 06 16:14:05 <grift>	so what i am saying is yes modularity 25%/packaging 75%
Jun 06 16:14:16 <misc>	attention, e.g. ?
Jun 06 16:14:17 <grift>	and bowlofeggs arguments are most compelling to me
Jun 06 16:14:29 <jwb>	grift, ah.  ok.
Jun 06 16:14:52 <grift>	focus/resources
Jun 06 16:15:44 <jwb>	i guess the way i would interpret that answer is what the candidate would like to work on the most.  because fesco doesn't have resources to direct in a typical manner
Jun 06 16:17:07 <grift>	maybe not direct but indirectly if you vote for someone that would like to work the most on something that you think is a priority then that potentially translates to more "attention"
Jun 06 16:17:25 <grift>	besides this thing isnt personal to me
Jun 06 16:17:38 <grift>	i am just relating
Jun 06 16:18:01 <misc>	well, I kinda see packaging as something quite mature, so while I didn't do package since one or two years, I am wondering if I missed something
Jun 06 16:18:15 <misc>	(also, how much people would pay for my vote ?)
Jun 06 16:19:41 <grift>	dont want to get into the matter to deeply just wanted to show me support for bowlofeggs agenda
Jun 06 16:44:21 <tibbs>	I heard a rumor that someone was going to nominate me for FESCo, but I'm thinking that isn't going to happen.
Jun 06 16:47:27 <sgallagh>	tibbs: FESCo is self nominated, but I think I remember a meeting recently where we acknowledged we’d be happy to see you run.
Jun 06 16:47:53 <tibbs>	Yeah, it was the FESCo meeting on the 25th.

Jun 07 05:34:29 <FranciscoD>	Hello! We're planning the next round of Fedora classroom sessions. If you'd like to take a session, please ping me in #fedora-classroom or drop me an e-mail. Thanks! https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom
Jun 07 06:41:07 <xvitaly[m]>	Hello. I think that User path prioritization (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/UserPathPrioritization) is not good for Fedora. It will create potential vulnerability: every application can easily create files in user's home directory, so they can create `~/.local/bin/sudo` and steal user's password when it will run `sudo something`.
Jun 07 06:49:07 <michich>	xvitaly[m], the application could already modify ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc to achieve the same result.
Jun 07 08:50:29 <number80>	.whoowns python-cradox
Jun 07 08:50:29 <zodbot>	number80: jpena
Jun 07 09:18:58 <sdgathman>	Just read Fedora "Privacy Policy".  So refreshing compared to what the other corps have put out.  Congrats to RedHat on keeping their corp relatively healthy!
Jun 07 09:22:56 <bowlofeggs>	:)
Jun 07 09:54:59 <tachoknight>	tstellar_: might you happen to be around?
Jun 07 10:22:15 <grift>	xvitaly[m] i agree but not for the security reason. It just sets a bad precendent. What is next .local/lib? Going to be hard to figure out that a program behaves strangly because the user has some other code in a file with a name the conflicts with the system in .local/{bin,lib}
Jun 07 10:54:07 <tibbs>	So how do you handle making a number of changes to a package in rawhide over time.  Is it acceptable to push commits you've made even though you're not actually done with the work you're doing and don't intend for everything to actually build?
Jun 07 10:54:42 <tibbs>	The problem is that at any time anyone could randomly decide to build whatever is in git at that moment.
Jun 07 10:55:43 <sgallagh>	tibbs: Standard aproach would be to keep things in a branch or fork and merge them when they're ready.
Jun 07 10:55:46 <tibbs>	I guess if you really need to push (for coordination between maintainers, for example) you could use a branch.
Jun 07 10:56:10 <tibbs>	But since branches tend to have other meanings and are permanent, overuse of private branches have significant downsides.
Jun 07 10:56:36 <nirik>	use branches in a fork
Jun 07 10:56:36 <sgallagh>	tibbs: So a fork into pagure.io and a pull-request would be an approach
Jun 07 10:57:07 <sgallagh>	Most people will understand that a pull request with a leading "{WIP]" means "don't push this yet, but it's here so people know it's happening".
Jun 07 10:57:54 <tibbs>	Unfortunately that's all needless complication, when you have git HEAD.
Jun 07 10:57:56 <nirik>	some people use [DO NOT MERGE YET] or the like
Jun 07 10:58:11 <sgallagh>	nirik: Potato potahto
Jun 07 10:58:16 <nirik>	yep
Jun 07 10:59:13 <tibbs>	Sometimes I think the best solution for that is for every release you can build to actually have a branch, and that koji never builds anything from HEAD.
Jun 07 10:59:29 <tibbs>	So right now rawhide would just be the f29 branch.
Jun 07 10:59:45 <nirik>	yeah
Jun 07 10:59:50 <tibbs>	And when branch time comes, we just create f30 branches.
Jun 07 11:00:10 <tibbs>	That way, you pull into "rawhide" from HEAD when you actually want changes to be seen in rawhide.
Jun 07 11:01:03 <tibbs>	But that has implications for how packages are retired and such which might not be desirable.
Jun 07 11:01:50 <nirik>	releng has been talking about trying to switch rawhide to the number also... to make it easier/better to switch to it/use things from it, etc...
Jun 07 11:01:54 <nirik>	but it's hard to change things.
Jun 07 11:02:06 <tibbs>	Well, it's hard to change people, I think.
Jun 07 11:03:15 <sgallagh>	tibbs: Scientists are doing some remarkable things with retroviruses these days...
Jun 07 11:03:16 <tibbs>	Conceptually it's probably simpler for the branch to actually correspond to the dist tag, instead having this special exception for HEAD/rawhide/f29-at-the-moment.
Jun 07 11:03:23 <nirik>	rather it takes people work/effort to adjust to change.
Jun 07 11:03:24 <sgallagh>	(Or just plain viruses...)
Jun 07 11:04:59 <tstellar_>	tachoknight: I'm here.
Jun 07 11:13:12 <tachoknight>	hey, so, i couldn't find the bodhi info about clang 6.0.1
Jun 07 11:13:41 <tachoknight>	i did a search for clang and there's 6.0.0, but nothing about 6.0.1 that got updated on rawhide
Jun 07 11:15:08 <rdieter>	tachoknight: bodhi is for releases only (not rawhide)
Jun 07 11:15:22 <tachoknight>	oh, i see
Jun 07 11:16:08 <tachoknight>	i thought everything that goes into any version of fedora needed to be backed by a bodhi release
Jun 07 11:16:20 <rdieter>	tachoknight: everything... *except* rawhide :)
Jun 07 11:16:27 *	tachoknight is still trying to keep all the various projects straight :)
Jun 07 11:17:40 <tachoknight>	okay, so is it proper to file a bug ticket around a rawhide issue?
Jun 07 11:18:24 <rdieter>	tachoknight: see also https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_update_HOWTO#Rawhide_and_early_Branched
Jun 07 11:18:54 <rdieter>	tachoknight: if you see a bug, filing a formal bug/ticket is almost always a good idea
Jun 07 11:19:22 <tachoknight>	ok
Jun 07 11:19:46 <rdieter>	tachoknight: what is the rawhide issue you see?

Jun 07 11:20:32 <tachoknight>	clang 6.0.1 fails with an error
Jun 07 11:20:48 <tachoknight>	just running 'clang'
Jun 07 11:25:58 <tibbs>	tachoknight: Confirmed: clang: relocation error: clang: symbol LLVMInitializeAArch64Target version LLVM_6.0 not defined in file libLLVM-6.0.so with link time reference
Jun 07 11:26:36 <tachoknight>	i filed https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1588601
Jun 07 11:26:36 <tibbs>	Just did dnf install /usr/bin/clang on a rawhide VM and ran clang.  Can't say anything else about it as I don't use clang.
Jun 07 11:26:54 <tachoknight>	it breaks my swift-lang package on rawhide :)
Jun 07 11:27:23 <tachoknight>	my automated bots started failing for rawhide, so i dug into it
Jun 07 11:28:44 <tachoknight>	i went to bodhi thinking this was going to be released to 28 soon and was worried
Jun 07 11:29:08 <tachoknight>	"nooo, there's tens of people who rely on clang!"

Jun 07 12:49:56 <tibbs>	So, does anyone know about Chrome/Chromium webextensions?
Jun 07 12:50:22 <tibbs>	Trying to draft some packaging guidelines, an I know how they work for Firefox.  But Chrome seems... odd.
Jun 07 12:50:51 <tibbs>	The only examples I have seem to imply that Chrome can only be told to install an extension from the store.
Jun 07 12:51:36 <tibbs>	So our packaging can only drop in a pointer that tells it to do that.  Which seems to kind of violate the point of packaging.
Jun 07 12:52:33 <tibbs>	But I'm sure it can use an extension that doesn't come from the store, or else nobody could develop the things.
Jun 07 13:29:29 <DrNick>	Google disabled external extension installation because Windows programs kept installing browser malware
Jun 07 13:29:46 <DrNick>	you have to manually enable developer mode and then you can only load unpackaged extensions
Jun 07 13:30:25 <tibbs>	"Windows"
Jun 07 13:31:51 <tibbs>	It's funny, because you have put the native messaging host stuff in place outside of the browser, but you cannot put the extension itself in place outside of the browser.
Jun 07 13:32:06 <tibbs>	Well, not funny, really; it's actually something of a failure.
Jun 07 13:33:24 <DrNick>	capitalism and/or the internet ruins everything
Jun 07 13:35:29 <tibbs>	I don't see either of those as being the problem.
Jun 07 13:36:43 <tibbs>	Chrome is the problem, using the "big hammer" on Linux because Windows has a deficiency.
Jun 07 13:37:35 <tibbs>	I would assume there's no global config file which could be used to force chrome into developer mode, or to tell it to trust extensions in a particular directory.
Jun 07 13:37:36 <DrNick>	surveillance capitalism requires communication back to the malicious actor, that wasn't generally possible before pervasive internet access
Jun 07 13:38:07 <tibbs>	Well, I mean, I like the X-Files too, but....
Jun 07 14:28:18 <tibbs>	Am I supposed to be able to do, say, "fedpkg clone container/bcg729.git"?
Jun 07 14:28:57 <tibbs>	Or "fedpkg clone modules/cmake.git"?
Jun 07 14:29:12 <tibbs>	Basically, can you only clone things under rpms?
Jun 07 14:30:32 <tibbs>	Oh, durr, leave off the .git.
Jun 07 14:39:37 <tibbs>	I wonder if we need to obsolete yum now.  I couldn't update dnf on a rawhide VM until I removed yum and yum-utils.
Jun 07 14:43:06 <tibbs>	Yeah, yum and dnf yum conflict (explicitly) as of the 25th.
Jun 07 14:43:35 <tibbs>	That will break upgrades to F29 for anyone who still had yum installed.
Jun 07 14:57:16 <eclipseo>	.any daMaestro
Jun 07 14:57:16 <zodbot>	eclipseo: daMaestro was last seen in #fedora-devel 1 day, 14 hours, 39 minutes, and 19 seconds ago: *** daMaestro <daMaestro!~jon@fedora/damaestro> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
Jun 07 15:37:02 <tomhughes>	WTF a major version update for emacs mid release?!?
Jun 07 15:50:18 <tibbs>	What did someone push it?
Jun 07 15:50:20 <tibbs>	I mean, I saw that it came out and built the package myself, but I wouldn't figure that anyone would try to push it to a stable release>
Jun 07 15:52:08 <rdieter>	https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-7058f01d23  went pretty fast (autokarma?)
Jun 07 15:52:08 <tibbs>	Definitely autokarma.
Jun 07 15:52:10 <tibbs>	Went to batched, even.
Jun 07 15:52:12 <tomhughes>	well I noticed because has been broken big time in that it now requires an explicit method
Jun 07 15:52:16 <tomhughes>	tramp I mean

Jun 07 16:12:44 <nirik>	wtf? why is webkitgtk not blocked in epel7...
Jun 07 16:13:31 <nirik>	grrrr....
Jun 07 16:59:38 <tibbs>	Interestingly, if you check out fedpkg clone rpms/foo you get a somewhat different git config.  I'm just going to assume that you really only want to check out things under rpms/ and that you don't want to do it with the "rpms/" prepended.
Jun 07 17:01:21 <tibbs>	For the record, I'm trying to fix the broken zsh completion for fedpkg clone, and make it use https://src.fedoraproject.org/pkgs-git-repos-list instead of trying to do some broken repoquery call.
Jun 07 17:34:19 <tmz>	tibbs: That's interesting.  The config in that case is bad for the bugzilla and sendemail values.
Jun 07 17:38:07 <tibbs>	Yeah, it's odd.  I don't know if it's a bug or you're just not ever supposed to specify the "rpms/" manually.
Jun 07 17:38:17 <tibbs>	I'm assuming the latter.
Jun 07 17:40:41 <tmz>	Well, as far as I can tell, you should be able to provide a namespace as part of the module argument to fedpkg clone.
Jun 07 17:40:46 <tmz>	The default it rpms/.
Jun 07 17:41:23 <tmz>	It's a bug that it's not trimming the namespace prefix from the bz url and sendemail address.
Jun 07 17:42:11 <tmz>	It's probably worth filing, if you get a minute.

Jun 08 11:59:11 *	nirik sees bowlofeggs opened a bit of a pandoras box there. Oh well. 
Jun 08 12:10:27 <bowlofeggs>	nirik: which pandoras box?
Jun 08 12:11:20 <nirik>	telling folks they can build from ?master since we didn't want them to do that... but I guess since it's already been done it doesn't matter anymore.
Jun 08 12:11:40 <bowlofeggs>	nirik: ah i didn't know we don't want people to do that
Jun 08 12:11:47 <bowlofeggs>	i've def done it before
Jun 08 12:11:59 <bowlofeggs>	i guess there is a slight race condition there
Jun 08 12:12:06 <nirik>	well, as noted the other day it makes it hard to know what hash was actually used.
Jun 08 12:12:17 <bowlofeggs>	but most of the packages i work on have little chance of someone else making a commit before i hit enter
Jun 08 12:12:22 <nirik>	that too
Jun 08 12:13:16 <bowlofeggs>	ah yeah, but since we know that's already happened i see little point in worrying about it more
Jun 08 12:13:27 <nirik>	yeah
Jun 08 12:14:07 <bowlofeggs>	feel free to reply that it's a problem if you think people shouldn't do that
Jun 08 12:15:00 <nirik>	sure. Also one problem is that we don't know what workflow people are using... so if you need to go make a change you don't know what to do.
Jun 08 12:15:13 <bowlofeggs>	i did receive some PRs to add EPEL if statements into the master branch of some of my packages while i was away, and they got merged before i was able to return and object and that made me sad, because we have branches for that!
Jun 08 12:15:22 <nirik>	ie, if someone builds always from master, you might try and change f27 branch and ... it's all wrong
Jun 08 12:15:39 <bowlofeggs>	nirik: well that's why i think people should embrace SCM
Jun 08 12:15:49 <nirik>	yeah, I always do the conditionals and merge, but your argument is making me rethink that
Jun 08 12:16:28 <bowlofeggs>	i was really just noting that what seems to commonly happen is less sensible than both alternatives i mentioned
Jun 08 12:17:06 <bowlofeggs>	i think embracing SCM is the ideal way to go. but merging master back to old branches and having if statements seems like a bad blend of the two options
Jun 08 12:18:18 *	rdieter raises hand as one who generally prefers conditionals and keeping branched merged... where reasonably possible
Jun 08 12:30:15 <tmz>	If we get rid of %changelog and other parts of the spec file that cause frequent merge conflicts, it's more viable.
Jun 08 12:31:23 <tmz>	Single spec files just aren't as well-suited to clean merge resolutions as a larger code base.
Jun 08 12:32:49 <nirik>	well, if you do changelog changes as uniq commits you can just not cherry pick them?
Jun 08 12:34:39 <tmz>	You still get conflicts most of the time.  They're easy to resolve, but they waste time and introduce chances to bugger the resolution.
Jun 08 12:35:06 <tmz>	cherry-picking is something I try hard to avoid.  That's just a short-cut for dumping a patch and applying it on another branch.
Jun 08 12:35:32 <bowlofeggs>	nirik: looks like https://pagure.io/koji/issue/550 was closed ~6 months ago
Jun 08 12:35:45 <tmz>	Since it creates a new commit rather than merges an existing commit, you lose the ability to ask what branches contain a particular fix.
Jun 08 12:35:46 <bowlofeggs>	i assume that patch is deployed to prod by now?
Jun 08 12:35:48 <rdieter>	it all depends on your work-flow (ie, I rarely have conflicts, but I'm wary to avoid things that cause them)
Jun 08 12:36:32 <bowlofeggs>	rdieter: i'm curious - what benefits do you perceive with the combination of if statements and merged branches, that isn't achieved with just one or the other of those two?
Jun 08 12:37:14 <rdieter>	bowlofeggs: probably because I do updates on multiple branches.  Doing separate updates/commits on each would be much less efficient
Jun 08 12:37:57 <bowlofeggs>	tmz: technically cherry picking is actually not the same as dumping and applying a patch, it does take history into account, sometimes in spooky ways
Jun 08 12:38:18 <tmz>	bowlofeggs: The point though is that it creates a new commit.
Jun 08 12:38:20 <rdieter>	If I commit a fix, I do it once and I'm done.  that only works if you're ok pushing latest versions to release branches of course
Jun 08 12:38:36 <tmz>	That's where it differs importantly from merging.
Jun 08 12:38:38 <bowlofeggs>	tmz: true about the commit id changing, though you can reference BZs and see if the BZ is mentioned in the branch's changelog as a workaround
Jun 08 12:39:10 <bowlofeggs>	rdieter: why not only have a master branch then?
Jun 08 12:39:21 <tmz>	bowlofeggs: Sure, there are plenty of of ways to work around it.  I prefer to not have to work around it though.
Jun 08 12:39:36 <rdieter>	bowlofeggs: that's the idea generally, yes.
Jun 08 12:41:09 <bowlofeggs>	rdieter: so my argument is that it doesn't add anything (that i can think of) to keep the branches identical *and* use if statements - you'd have less work and achieve the same outcome if you just had a master branch with if statements
Jun 08 12:41:45 <bowlofeggs>	but my further argument is that i think using the branches and no if statements is most sensible, for the same reasons that the upstream code we package does this
Jun 08 12:41:45 <rdieter>	bowlofeggs: ok... though that's not currently possible (or is that the discussion, to make that possible?)
Jun 08 12:41:51 <bowlofeggs>	rdieter: it is possible
Jun 08 12:42:01 <bowlofeggs>	rdieter: i do it when i build bodhi for f27-infra :)
Jun 08 12:42:05 <rdieter>	I'm pretty sure I can only do f28 builds from f28 branch
Jun 08 12:42:17 <rdieter>	or at least, I'm *supposed* to
Jun 08 12:42:55 <bowlofeggs>	rdieter: if we are *supposed* to do that, i guess i wasn't aware of that policy - is that a formal policy?
Jun 08 12:43:08 <rdieter>	all the docs say to do it that way
Jun 08 12:43:14 <rdieter>	fedpkg switch-branch f28; fedpkg build
Jun 08 12:43:23 <bowlofeggs>	as policy, or just as a documented workflow though?
Jun 08 12:43:39 <bowlofeggs>	to me a suggested documented workflow isn't the same as a policy
Jun 08 12:44:03 <rdieter>	I think you're being ... pedantic a bit, but ok
Jun 08 12:44:09 <bowlofeggs>	well i don't think so
Jun 08 12:44:23 <rdieter>	I guess we can agree to disagree on that specific point then
Jun 08 12:44:30 <bowlofeggs>	i can document a way to do something to help someone, without communicate that they must not do it any other way
Jun 08 12:44:47 <bowlofeggs>	docs that teach you how to do something aren't the same thing as policy
Jun 08 12:44:57 <rdieter>	if you insist it should be made into policy, then so be it
Jun 08 12:45:10 <bowlofeggs>	no, i'm not insisting it should be policy
Jun 08 12:45:12 <rdieter>	it's still the general best-practice, and what is documented
Jun 08 12:45:14 <bowlofeggs>	quite the opposite
Jun 08 12:45:26 <bowlofeggs>	i'm trying to persuade others, that's all
Jun 08 12:45:37 <rdieter>	we're getting off into the weeds here methinks
Jun 08 12:45:42 <bowlofeggs>	i actualyl wrote about this on the devel list, including the bit about wanting to persuade and not enforce :)
Jun 08 12:46:19 <rdieter>	fine, do it your way... but if it breaks, you get to keep the pieces
Jun 08 12:46:35 <bowlofeggs>	it's not going to break
Jun 08 12:47:03 <bowlofeggs>	seems like a bit unfriendly tone there
Jun 08 12:47:05 <rdieter>	<shrug>, who's to say... I do know one thing: the documented best-practice is the thing that is most likely to not break.
Jun 08 12:47:16 <bowlofeggs>	though text is hard to read tone into
Jun 08 12:47:26 <rdieter>	if you go outside of that, all bets are off
Jun 08 12:47:45 <bowlofeggs>	well, i think a lot of if statements in a spec file could more easily lead to broken spec files actually
Jun 08 12:48:07 <bowlofeggs>	it's harder to tell what the final spec will look like if they get pretty complex
Jun 08 12:48:08 <rdieter>	that's altogether another topic
Jun 08 12:48:21 <rdieter>	but sure, complexity matters
Jun 08 12:48:35 <pingou>	bowlofeggs: I advocated at one point about dropping all non-necessary branches in git
Jun 08 12:48:47 <pingou>	ie: not enforce a f28 branch if it's identical to master
Jun 08 12:48:48 <rdieter>	but keeping separate branches are also increased complexity in it's own way
Jun 08 12:48:54 <pingou>	and I got push back from releng
Jun 08 12:48:55 <bowlofeggs>	pingou: yeah that would make sense to me
Jun 08 12:49:33 <pingou>	one of the issue was: you suddenly don't know which branch is supposed to go where and where to add a fix for a release
Jun 08 12:49:44 <pingou>	and w/ stream branching around the corner it gets even more messy
Jun 08 12:49:45 <rdieter>	my roundabout point is that it's fairly impossible to draw any broad conclusions what workflow is best
Jun 08 12:49:51 <pingou>	so I ended up not pushing this forward
Jun 08 12:49:55 <bowlofeggs>	rdieter: yeah, i think the combination of separate branches and if statements is particularly strange, since it doesn't really make use of the branches for any particular purpose that i can see
Jun 08 12:50:14 <rdieter>	bowlofeggs: I do not disagree
Jun 08 12:50:43 <bowlofeggs>	rdieter: well i think the workflow should be up to the packager - i'm not at all arguing for a policy for my workflow
Jun 08 12:50:53 <rdieter>	except only that branches is generally how release builds are done
Jun 08 12:50:56 <bowlofeggs>	i just wanted to present a persuasive argument and leave the decision to each packager
Jun 08 12:51:28 <rdieter>	ok, I perceived a push for non-merged branches
Jun 08 12:51:48 <pingou>	bowlofeggs: releng seemed pretty against the "build where you want" workflow
Jun 08 12:52:02 <bowlofeggs>	rdieter: i advocate for packagers to consider using non-merged branches of their own free will :)
Jun 08 12:52:03 <rdieter>	"i think embracing SCM is the ideal way to go." based on this and context
Jun 08 12:57:07 <grift>	there is this neat package called termysequence that i would like to see in the main repositories but it needs a sponsor: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ewalsh/termysequence/
Jun 08 12:59:30 <rdieter>	grift: is there a package submitted for review yet?
Jun 08 12:59:34 <grift>	yes
Jun 08 12:59:44 <grift>	and its even reviewed
Jun 08 12:59:45 <rdieter>	ok, that link would be more helpful then :)
Jun 08 12:59:50 <grift>	just needs a blessing
Jun 08 13:00:44 <grift>	rdieter: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/JZBQRCFD6CYPLCYU23J5F424WLZAUF6X/
Jun 08 13:01:00 <grift>	should be excelent for you as its qt
Jun 08 13:02:31 <rdieter>	ok, I'll try to hit it over the weekend
Jun 08 13:02:39 <grift>	thanks in advance
Jun 08 13:23:14 <tibbs>	grift: If your package has passed review (fedora-review flag set to '+') then note the last sentence of this section in the wiki: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_get_sponsored_into_the_packager_group#Submitting_quality_new_packages
Jun 08 13:24:17 <grift>	its not my package BTW, i am just very excited, and i "know" the authors work
Jun 08 14:12:41 <walters>	tmz, yep, item #1 on https://github.com/cgwalters/rpmdistro-gitoverlay/blob/master/doc/reworking-fedora-releng.md#remove-the-rpm-changelog-from-spec-files
Jun 08 14:21:09 <RaphGro>	for me, spec changelog is something else than git log with the commit messages
Jun 08 14:22:12 <RaphGro>	entries to %changelog are related to release tag
Jun 08 14:33:00 <tmz>	walters: Indeed, that's come up for years, even before git made it more obvious thanks to the ease of merging.  Thanks for working on that list.  No matter how things turn out, it's useful to have such a document.
Jun 08 14:34:05 <tmz>	RaphGro: No doubt there are differing ways of using the changelog.  Removing it from the spec file doesn't necessarily mean replacing it with the git log (some prefer that, some don't).
Jun 08 14:34:36 <RaphGro>	tmz: we've guidelines for %changelog
Jun 08 14:35:51 <tmz>	RaphGro: I know.  The only point I was making is that with the %changelog in the spec file it nearly always causes merge conflicts.  That was directly related to the idea of using more merging between branches instead of %if conditionals.
Jun 08 14:36:39 <RaphGro>	wah? build conditionals in %changelog section? do you have an example?
Jun 08 14:37:46 <tmz>	RaphGro: No, that's not what I'm talking about.
Jun 08 14:38:41 <tibbs>	Well, damn, someone just brought me a good old IBM Model M keyboard.
Jun 08 14:39:20 <tmz>	RaphGro: The conversation about the %changelog came up as one reason why merging changes between branches was more painful than it needed to be.  That was a longer conversation.
Jun 08 14:39:39 <tibbs>	One of the keys is dead, but there's no way I'm throwing it away.
Jun 08 14:46:09 <nirik>	bowlofeggs: yes, should be in. where is it storing that? db?
Jun 08 15:18:01 <bowlofeggs>	nirik: i have no idea
Jun 08 15:18:09 <bowlofeggs>	i don't see it in the web ui
Jun 08 15:18:24 <bowlofeggs>	hopefully it's available via the API
Jun 08 15:21:22 <rsc>	How to package in-line documentation best? I have a webbased software which has HTML documentation, but also links it from the public document root when using the software. Leave it in /usr/share/<foo> which is Alias in Apache...or move to %doc and symlink?
Jun 08 15:23:17 <RaphGro>	rsc: I'll vote for first option
Jun 08 15:23:30 <tibbs>	Unfortunately if you move it to docdir you will have to deal with selinux.
Jun 08 15:23:50 <tibbs>	You can still mark it as %doc if you like, so a nodocs installation won't have it.
Jun 08 15:26:43 <rsc>	tibbs: but a nodocs installation might have impact on user experience
Jun 08 15:27:33 <tibbs>	.... because the documentation isn't there?
Jun 08 15:27:39 <rsc>	Right.
Jun 08 15:27:53 <tibbs>	So why do a nodocs installation when you actually want the docs?
Jun 08 15:28:08 <rsc>	So why using %doc at all? :)
Jun 08 15:28:15 <RaphGro>	IMHO it is not doc as in the common sense
Jun 08 15:28:33 <tibbs>	I quite disagree, but the point is academic.
Jun 08 15:28:47 <RaphGro>	would you mark %doc the default apache page?
Jun 08 15:29:04 <rdieter>	no
Jun 08 15:29:06 <tibbs>	I wouldn't, because it's not documentation.
Jun 08 15:29:51 <tibbs>	Though I wish that whole default page setup were in a separate package so I could just not install it.
Jun 08 15:34:32 <rsc>	+1
Jun 08 22:17:03 <QuLogic>	mock seems to be broken on the ppc64 test machine
Jun 08 22:17:39 <QuLogic>	it asks for root password even with sudo, in sudo su as root
Jun 08 22:18:09 <QuLogic>	or after adding user to mock group
Jun 08 22:29:25 <QuLogic>	fortunately, it's been updated to f28 now, so I guess I can just do things outside mock
Jun 09 01:06:47 <mikedep333>	This package could use an epel7 release. https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gnome-calendar . It looks like there is no epel7 branch at all. I submitted https://pagure.io/releng/fedora-scm-requests/issue/2913 7 months ago and did not understand the comment.
Jun 09 01:07:43 <mikedep333>	"The branch in PDC already exists" I am trying to understand the product definition center and all right now, but I accidentally already submitted another one.
Jun 09 01:07:44 <mikedep333>	https://pagure.io/releng/fedora-scm-requests/issue/6966
Jun 09 01:08:26 <mikedep333>	Can someone advise me? Someone else had a similar experience: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/DTDJI7R2J2TRAPTYUPEBWLT5JRR2HFZY/
Jun 09 01:14:41 <rdieter>	mikedep333: I would have followed up the original request with a comment like: I'm not sure what you mean exactly, but I'm fairly certain the epel7 branch in fact does not exist, at least not according to the list of branches on https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gnome-calendar
Jun 09 01:15:29 <mikedep333>	OK, thank you, I'll do that.
Jun 09 01:15:51 <rdieter>	mikedep333: well, since you just opened a new one, mention it there, possibly with a link to the old request too
Jun 09 01:16:03 <mikedep333>	Thanks, I'll do that.
Jun 09 01:16:45 <rdieter>	if worse comes to worse, may need to ask for help from kind folks in #fedora-admin
Jun 09 01:16:52 <mikedep333>	Roger
Jun 09 01:17:53 <rdieter>	I vaugely recall that happening to me once, but I can't remember the details behind what it took to resolve
Jun 09 01:20:05 <mikedep333>	Yeah, maybe pagure and the PDC are usually in sync but sometimes are not? Maybe this only happens for epel7 branches?
Jun 09 14:30:24 <bowlofeggs>	rdieter: have you performed any koji chain builds lately? i'm seeing a problem when i try it, and nirik suggested asking you if you've had trouble or not
Jun 09 14:30:31 <bowlofeggs>	https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/bPOwDJ13jp0arF0UUOBYSg
Jun 09 14:37:06 <bowlofeggs>	i filed https://pagure.io/releng/issue/7559 about it
Jun 09 14:46:20 <bowlofeggs>	well, turns out that fedpkg chain-build works, so i guess my koji command was wrong in some way: https://pagure.io/releng/issue/7559#comment-516061
Jun 09 17:41:47 <sdgathman>	How do you handle a package where the git source has a subdir pointing at another git repo.
Jun 09 17:42:14 <sdgathman>	git clone gets the sub repos, but git archive only does the one you're in.
Jun 09 17:42:24 <sdgathman>	Do I make 2 source files?
Jun 09 17:45:01 <sdgathman>	archive on github does get the sub-module either.
Jun 09 17:45:03 <sdgathman>	doesn't
Jun 10 05:14:31 <jrobeson>	anybody else having a problem using dnf right now?
Jun 10 05:14:41 <jrobeson>	dnf update just hangs
Jun 10 05:24:03 <misc>	nope
Jun 10 05:24:16 <misc>	I would use strace to see on what it is blocked
Jun 11 06:15:31 <CustosLimen>	hi
Jun 11 06:19:04 <CustosLimen>	I logged a bug - but nobody responded on it
Jun 11 06:19:05 <CustosLimen>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1585639
Jun 11 06:19:08 <CustosLimen>	did I do something wrong
Jun 11 06:19:30 <CustosLimen>	or is it because it is low priority
Jun 11 06:55:28 <tswsl1989>	CustosLimen: Bug looks fine, so probably just a case of the maintainer(s) being busy with other issues/other work.
Jun 11 06:56:18 <CustosLimen>	okay cool
Jun 11 08:27:51 <misc>	so, someone added a downstream patch to a package, and based on that downstream patch, I sent a patch on ansible that got merged. Now the downstream patch is gone (on a stable release), and so it broke stuff in prod for me. is there a way to signal that we shouldn't 1) add custom patch downstream adding option 2) revert them on stable release ?
Jun 11 08:28:15 <misc>	(cause i was operating on the "upstream first" policy, but if packagers don't follow it, that's kinda useless)
Jun 11 08:31:07 <Son_Goku>	misc, what I usually do is annotate the patch listings in the spec so that people don't remove them early
Jun 11 08:31:40 <misc>	Son_Goku: that's not my package, the patch should never have been there in the first place
Jun 11 08:32:11 <Son_Goku>	well, if the patches are submitted upstream, then I see no harm in shipping the patch
Jun 11 08:32:23 <misc>	it wasn't submitted upstream
Jun 11 08:32:29 <misc>	it plainly did add a feature
Jun 11 08:32:36 <Son_Goku>	oh, you didn't author the patch...
Jun 11 08:32:42 <Son_Goku>	then I unno
Jun 11 08:32:55 <Son_Goku>	that's up to the ansible maint group
Jun 11 08:33:04 <Son_Goku>	:maint ansible
Jun 11 08:33:09 <Son_Goku>	erk
Jun 11 08:33:11 <Son_Goku>	wrong command
Jun 11 08:33:14 <Son_Goku>	.whoowns ansible
Jun 11 08:33:15 <zodbot>	Son_Goku: kevin
Jun 11 08:33:18 <Son_Goku>	meep
Jun 11 08:34:02 <misc>	Son_Goku: I think i wans't clear
Jun 11 08:34:08 <misc>	acme-tiny had a patch adding --chain
Jun 11 08:34:12 <misc>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/acme-tiny/blob/master/f/acme-tiny-chain2.patch
Jun 11 08:34:15 <Son_Goku>	oh
Jun 11 08:34:23 <misc>	based on this, believing this was upstream code, i sent a patch to ansible
Jun 11 08:34:36 <misc>	https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/35144
Jun 11 08:34:39 <misc>	it got accepted
Jun 11 08:34:49 <Son_Goku>	oh, crap
Jun 11 08:34:53 <tomhughes>	adding features downstream that aren't at least already in the piplien upstream seems like a very bad idea in general...
Jun 11 08:34:56 <Son_Goku>	you broke ansible by doing that, didn't you?
Jun 11 08:34:57 <misc>	then on the stable release, acme-tiny got upgraded from 0.x to 4.x, then the patch was removed
Jun 11 08:35:13 <tomhughes>	and if you do it I would suggest a clear comment in the spec explaining the situation
Jun 11 08:35:14 <misc>	and ti broke ansible
Jun 11 08:35:39 <misc>	Son_Goku: yeah, but it worked when we tested on RHEL/Fedora
Jun 11 08:35:48 <Son_Goku>	Works on my machine(TM)
Jun 11 08:35:49 <Son_Goku>	:D
Jun 11 08:35:59 <misc>	and it broke for a specific usecase that was already broken before (because I sent 3 others patchs the same day)
Jun 11 08:36:04 <Son_Goku>	ah
Jun 11 08:36:04 <tomhughes>	maybe sdgathman could comment on the history
Jun 11 08:36:21 <misc>	I see the intention was good
Jun 11 08:36:24 <tomhughes>	ah https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/acme-tiny/c/ecd867acdf5380ade6874c160e8a00ce14d3f8ba?branch=master says --chain is now the default
Jun 11 08:36:36 <misc>	yeah, but so --chain fail with a error
Jun 11 08:38:13 <Son_Goku>	unrelated... but could someone give karma for https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-af2158841f, https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=perl-BSSolv, and https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=perl-Diff-LibXDiff ?
Jun 11 08:45:35 <_val_>	Hi. While ago I reported a bug which was fixed here: https://pagure.io/fedora-release/pull-request/123  . Now on F28 I downloaded the source dnf download --source fedora-release && rpm2cpio fedora-release-28-2.src.rpm | cpio -civ 'convert-to-edition.lua'
Jun 11 08:46:20 <_val_>	The fix isn't there yet. This is the bug I reported: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1534531
Jun 11 08:53:08 <FranciscoD>	_val_: it really depends on whether a new release has been made since the fix was merged, or if they included the fix in the new build
Jun 11 08:53:55 <sgallagh>	_val_: Ugh, I think that's another victim of a bad timing issue we had in F28
Jun 11 08:53:58 <_val_>	FranciscoD: The latter, that's what I am wondering.
Jun 11 08:54:14 <sgallagh>	_val_: There were a bunch of changes that were merged to Rawhide after the branch instead of before it
Jun 11 08:54:27 <sgallagh>	And which were therefore missed in the F28 release and we didn't notice
Jun 11 08:54:38 <_val_>	sgallagh: Ah, Yeah I saw you did the merge ^.  I can fix it now locally but that's just uhm to much of a hassle.
Jun 11 08:55:01 <sgallagh>	_val_: FWIW, that code is getting heavily rewritten for F29 :-P
Jun 11 08:55:22 <_val_>	sgallagh: Ah Great! We'll wait another year  hehe.
Jun 11 08:55:54 <sgallagh>	_val_: I can merge it and get it rebuilt for F28, but that won't help anyone that installs from DVD media :(
Jun 11 08:55:56 <_val_>	Thanks!  I will just keep an eye on it and fix it locally deploy the package through our local repositories and deal with it
Jun 11 08:57:01 <_val_>	sgallagh: I agree. Well I just wanted to bring this to your attention. It isn't in a hurry except that our  rpm -V scripts are bomb-mailing us ^
Jun 11 08:58:15 <sgallagh>	Sorry about that. We had a bunch of issues with that.
Jun 11 08:59:08 <sgallagh>	_val_: FWIW, that fix *would* have been in F27
Jun 11 08:59:22 <sgallagh>	It was just that it got overlooked for F28 (and regressed)
Jun 11 08:59:29 <_val_>	sgallagh: Yes. I checked it there as well, it wasn't fixed there either
Jun 11 08:59:36 <sgallagh>	Hmm, that's odd
Jun 11 08:59:38 <sgallagh>	It should have been
Jun 11 09:00:27 <sgallagh>	Oh, maybe we didn't bother because it was unlikely to matter post-install.
Jun 11 09:00:31 *	sgallagh sighs
Jun 11 09:00:39 <sgallagh>	And F27 would already have been out at that point
Jun 11 09:02:24 <_val_>	sgallagh: I tested it first on f27 then f28 so that's why I concluded that it wasn't fixed. It isn't a big problem except that the verification of the packages will fail for us.
Jun 11 09:11:49 <sgallagh>	_val_: Huh... you're right. It was merged to F27 but releng never did a build with it
Jun 11 09:12:32 <sgallagh>	Same with F28; it's there in the source tree, but no associated build
Jun 11 09:12:39 *	sgallagh flips tables
Jun 11 09:16:28 <sgallagh>	_val_: Oh, crap. I think I just figured it out. There's some funny business with the way the lua is imported and the way that the fedora-release package gets releases.
Jun 11 09:17:39 <sgallagh>	The short version is that because RPM imports the LUA at SRPM creation time, the .lua file needs to be outside the tarball. When the change was merged upstream, it wasn't also copied to the downstream outside-the-tarball version.
Jun 11 09:17:59 <sgallagh>	This is yet another reason why this package should not have a separate upstream...
Jun 11 09:25:33 <_val_>	sgallagh: I noticed since it wasn't included in the .tar.gz (tarball). .. but I thought ah.. it must be me :-p
Jun 11 09:26:06 <_val_>	Thanks for your effort!
Jun 11 09:27:26 <sgallagh>	_val_: I appreciate that, but I will be working on making this *less* effort going forward :)
Jun 11 09:30:44 <_val_>	sgallagh: hah! Even better. Fixing the source problem is much more efficient indeed!
Jun 11 09:54:51 <sgallagh>	zbyszek: Is there a way to create two systemd units that are in conflict, but indicate that if both are enabled, one should be used in preference to the other?
Jun 11 09:55:42 <sgallagh>	Hmm, actually I think that's just how Conflicts= works in general.
Jun 11 09:55:53 <sgallagh>	I was thinking it would refuse to start the second one, but the docs disagree.
Jun 11 09:58:15 <tpopela>	hmm somethings doesn't work as it should be?
Jun 11 09:58:18 <tpopela>	130 $ fedpkg new-sources webkitgtk-2.20.3.tar.xz
Jun 11 09:58:20 <tpopela>	Could not execute new_sources: Error occurs inside the server.
Jun 11 10:00:57 <bexelbie>	Does anyone remember the name of the site where you can search fedmsg? /me is drawing a blank
Jun 11 10:01:35 <mizdebsk>	bexelbie, datagrepper
Jun 11 10:01:58 <bexelbie>	mizdebsk, thank you - I could not find it
Jun 11 10:33:23 <zbyszek>	sgallagh: what you wrote sounds plausible
Jun 11 10:33:46 <zbyszek>	I'm not sure about the details of Conflicts= handling from the top of my head
Jun 11 10:34:09 <zbyszek>	Generally I'd expect that if both units are started in the same transaction, one would be removed from the transaction.
Jun 11 10:34:27 <zbyszek>	If they are started separately, when the second one is started, the first one will be stopped.
Jun 11 10:34:35 <sgallagh>	zbyszek: Basically what I was thinking about doing was providing a reservedcockpit.socket unit file that would hold port 9090 until cockpit.socket starts (if enabled).
Jun 11 10:35:01 <sgallagh>	So I'd have Conflicts=cockpit.socket and Before=Cockpit.socket in the reservedcockpit.socket unit
Jun 11 10:35:42 <sgallagh>	The intention being that we would disallow anyone from binding port 9090 except Cockpit (unless they have sufficient privilege to stop reservedcockpit.socket)
Jun 11 10:37:19 <sgallagh>	zbyszek: On a scale of 1 to Hannibal Lector, how crazy an idea is that?
Jun 11 10:37:33 <tomhughes>	"If a unit has a Conflicts= setting on another unit, starting the former will stop the latter and vice versa. "
Jun 11 10:37:36 <tomhughes>	says the manual page
Jun 11 10:38:15 <tomhughes>	rsyncd does something similar - the .socket unit conflicts with the not-templated .service so that if you start the socket unit to have systemd listen it stops the service
Jun 11 10:40:53 <sgallagh>	tomhughes: Right, so I *think* my cockamamie scheme will work
Jun 11 11:09:52 <zbyszek>	sgallagh: sorry for the delay, I went on a bugzilla spelunking trip
Jun 11 11:10:03 <zbyszek>	So generally the right solution would be to make cockpit socket activated.
Jun 11 11:10:05 <sgallagh>	zbyszek: And lived to tell the tale!
Jun 11 11:10:15 <sgallagh>	zbyszek: It's already socket activated
Jun 11 11:10:43 <sgallagh>	The problem is that it's now become a well-known port, but if it's not currently running on a machine, that port is available for a malicious user to bind.
Jun 11 11:11:04 <sgallagh>	And an unaware admin could then punch credentials into a faked cockpit login screen
Jun 11 11:11:55 <zbyszek>	sgallagh: See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4580
Jun 11 11:11:56 <sgallagh>	So essentially, I want to have a fake socket-activated service that we can install by default on Fedora, ad that if cockpit is later installed/started, it will take over that port
Jun 11 11:12:48 <sgallagh>	zbyszek: That sounds like it would improve the situation (I wouldn't need a dummy service)
Jun 11 11:16:09 <sgallagh>	zbyszek: Do you understand the problem I'm trying to solve?
Jun 11 11:16:14 <zbyszek>	sgallagh: yes
Jun 11 11:16:17 <sgallagh>	ok
Jun 11 11:18:49 <sgallagh>	zbyszek: So, does that sound like a reasonable approach? Originally I wanted to solve this with SELinux, but the SELinux team balked at the idea of confining unconfined_u like that
Jun 11 11:20:45 <zbyszek>	sgallagh: yeah, it sounds reasonable
Jun 11 11:21:17 <zbyszek>	I'm not sure about all the details though, i.e. how to make sure that the UX when enabling and disabling cockpit is as expected.
Jun 11 11:22:09 <sgallagh>	zbyszek: I don't think the UX would need to change if the Conflicts= and ordering are in the reservedcockpit.socket
Jun 11 11:22:34 <sgallagh>	I'll certainly test it all out, but I figured I should check with you if there were any obvious disasters to watch out for :)
Jun 11 11:22:44 <zbyszek>	Cool, let me know how it goes ;)
Jun 11 11:25:15 <sgallagh>	Will do!
Jun 11 12:32:38 <erAck>	hum "funny".. for an external SSD /dev/sdb1 fdisk -l says HPFS/NTFS/exFAT, while gparted says File System "unknown" and in Nautilus it's not offered to be mounted
Jun 11 12:33:18 *	erAck is going to reformat anyway, but..
Jun 11 12:34:32 <erAck>	btw, why is zsh not in /etc/shells ...
Jun 11 12:37:02 <tmz>	erAck: It should be added to /etc/shells in the zsh %post: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/zsh/blob/master/f/zsh.spec#_121-130
Jun 11 12:37:34 <erAck>	tmz: probably messed up during upgrade to F28
Jun 11 12:38:35 <erAck>	maybe didn't merge the config or overwrote with maintainer's
Jun 11 13:27:38 <omajid>	hi! anyon eknow why mlock() would be failing in brew?
Jun 11 13:28:06 <omajid>	this code i am trying to run fails. strace shows:: mlock(0x7f14578ea000, 4096)       = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
Jun 11 13:36:31 <omajid>	uhm. s/brew/koji
Jun 11 13:36:44 <omajid>	and copr, to be more precise: https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/omajid/dotnet-2.1/fedora-28-x86_64/00765052-dotnet/build.log.gz
Jun 11 14:06:48 <DrNick>	blocking mlock() seems like the kind of thing you'd do on a build machine
Jun 11 14:09:34 <tomhughes>	I suspect it means that RLIMIT_MEMLOCK is zero though the manual page is a bit unclear
Jun 11 15:02:59 <redi>	how/where are DNF groups defined?

Jun 11 20:36:46 <scx>	Hello
Jun 11 20:37:06 <scx>	Can someone give me any example of such repo?: https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/user_documentation.html#scm
Jun 12 00:55:36 <QuLogic>	ignatenkobrain: tibbs: any idea what failed here? https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=23561 I ran a scratch build and nothing was wrong...
Jun 12 01:09:25 <QuLogic>	ah, found a more recent build on koschei
Jun 12 01:10:13 <QuLogic>	looks like an old lua-lgi bug
Jun 12 02:43:43 <ignatenkobrain>	QuLogic: yep, lgi bug
Jun 12 03:40:08 <superboum>	scx: I don't know if it's what you are searching, but I use this repository: https://github.com/superboum/rpm to build a copr package automatically from a .spec file (I am using the makefile approach)
Jun 12 07:14:27 <pac23>	hi
Jun 12 07:14:45 <pac23>	i am trying to package a different linux kernel for fedora
Jun 12 07:14:49 <pac23>	stuck at the patch step
Jun 12 07:14:54 <pac23>	could use some help
Jun 12 07:20:34 <Son_Goku>	pac23, check in #fedora-kernel
Jun 12 07:20:41 <pac23>	thanks
Jun 12 07:35:36 <AquaL1te>	hi, i have 2 questions. first one is, i made the mistake of doing `fedpkg build` instead of `fedpkg update`. the package is already in the branch, so by adding it as a 'new' candidate, will that be ignore? second one is; i have to fill in which type of update this is. https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_update_HOWTO#Update_attributes says it's "self-explanatory". buuuut, i don't really agree.
Jun 12 07:35:42 <AquaL1te>	this new update contains upstream bugfixes, and new features (major version bump). so which one would it be?
Jun 12 07:38:11 <mizdebsk>	AquaL1te, major version bumps should be avoided, except when fixing bugs that would otherwise difficult to backport patches for
Jun 12 07:38:26 <mizdebsk>	so "bugfixes", or don't update at all
Jun 12 07:38:56 <mizdebsk>	and re first question, i don't understand what you are really asking
Jun 12 08:30:45 <AquaL1te>	mizdebsk: `fedpkg build` creates e.g. a "f27-candidate" instead of an updates candidate. but the package i want to update is already included. so my question is, will this be ignored by the build system since it's already included? for the other answer you provided; i will upload it to rawhide as an update. but the question then remains. will this be a bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage?
Jun 12 08:30:51 <AquaL1te>	it's not security and newpackage for sure. it's an enhancement with bug fixes :)
Jun 12 08:36:57 <tomhughes>	rawhide doesn't have updates so you can't set an update type
Jun 12 08:37:50 <AquaL1te>	tomhughes: i indeed noticed the latest version is already in rawhide, due to my `fedpkg build` :) i guess it's all set then
Jun 12 09:46:56 <bowlofeggs>	mhroncok++ thanks for fixing bodhi to work with python 3.7
Jun 12 09:46:57 <zodbot>	bowlofeggs: Karma for churchyard changed to 2 (for the f28 release cycle):  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/tags/cookie/any
Jun 12 09:47:22 <mhroncok>	bowlofeggs: ;) will you do a release or shall I prepa a dist-git PR with patches?
Jun 12 09:47:51 <bowlofeggs>	mhroncok: i can do a release with these patches
Jun 12 09:51:58 <mhroncok>	bowlofeggs: ok, please do and update in Fedora rahide
Jun 12 09:52:00 <mhroncok>	w
Jun 12 09:52:12 <mhroncok>	bowlofeggs: the package builds ok with both the patches
Jun 12 09:54:02 <bowlofeggs>	mhroncok: will do
Jun 12 09:54:09 <mhroncok>	tibbs: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#File_and_Directory_Dependencies RPM gives you the ability to depend on files or directories instead of packages. Whenever possible you SHOULD avoid file and directory dependencies as they slow down dependency resolution and require the package manager to download file lists in addition to to regular dependency information. 
Jun 12 09:54:23 <mhroncok>	tibbs: is that true for /usr/bin/xxx requires?
Jun 12 09:56:11 <ignatenkobrain>	mhroncok: package manager part is not entirely true. There are certain paths which is part of primaryxml
Jun 12 09:56:25 <mhroncok>	ignatenkobrain: like /usr/bin/xxx, right?
Jun 12 09:56:38 <mhroncok>	ignatenkobrain: at least that's what i get from https://pagure.io/packaging-committee/issue/714
Jun 12 09:59:22 <rdieter>	mhroncok: I believe it still theoretically slows down resolution
Jun 12 09:59:31 <rdieter>	(even if extra downloads aren't required)
Jun 12 10:01:06 <rdieter>	it's a SHOULD, use your best judgement.  Is the use of file dependencies worth the price?
Jun 12 10:03:18 <ignatenkobrain>	rdieter: it doesn't slow down
Jun 12 10:11:04 <mhroncok>	rdieter: yes, I need /usr/bin/foo and it moved from python2-foo to python3-foo and I don't really care, becasue i just need the tool
Jun 12 10:11:29 <mhroncok>	the point is, i've been using this all time and now somebody say: wait, but it's slow
Jun 12 10:13:06 <walters>	dnf/libdnf always download the filelists and AFAIK have for a long time; the "dynamic filelist" behavior wasn't carried over from yum and would be fairly hard to implement on top of libsolv anyways
Jun 12 10:13:38 <walters>	even if the optimization was re-implemented, it only takes one commonly used package to trigger it, then it doesn't matter if no one else used it
Jun 12 10:14:13 <walters>	IMO the sane thing to do is "pre-optimize" the rpm-md, and filter the filelists - this has been covered extensively elsewhere
Jun 12 10:17:05 <walters>	https://pagure.io/packaging-committee/issue/714 for example
Jun 12 10:22:46 <mhroncok>	walters: I've seen thta one and it inrectly says that /usr/bin/... i fine
Jun 12 10:22:49 <mhroncok>	is
Jun 12 10:25:59 <rdieter>	ignatenkobrain: file dependencies are always searched whether they're used or not? :-P
Jun 12 10:26:42 <ignatenkobrain>	rdieter: it's same function in libsolv
Jun 12 10:26:47 <ignatenkobrain>	pool_whatprovides()
Jun 12 10:26:56 <ignatenkobrain>	the ones from primary.xml
Jun 12 10:27:16 <Son_Goku>	it is possible to selectively load files into the pool
Jun 12 10:27:25 <Son_Goku>	so we _could_ implement a variant of the optimization technique
Jun 12 10:27:43 <Son_Goku>	we just need a way to reset the sack without losing the proposed transaction in libdnf
Jun 12 10:28:01 <ignatenkobrain>	Son_Goku: it's irrelevant here
Jun 12 10:28:16 <ignatenkobrain>	dnf always loads primary.xml
Jun 12 10:28:20 <ignatenkobrain>	it's enough to cover 99% of packages in fedora
Jun 12 10:28:43 <ignatenkobrain>	Son_Goku: again, irrelevant
Jun 12 10:28:49 <ignatenkobrain>	libdnf should be teached to set callback for libsolv
Jun 12 10:28:50 <ignatenkobrain>	then you don't need to reset sack
Jun 12 10:30:00 <Son_Goku>	sure

Jun 12 11:43:02 <bowlofeggs>	mhroncok: excellent - will do!
Jun 12 11:43:05 <bowlofeggs>	and thanks again!

Jun 12 11:52:25 <raveit65>	mhroncok, rdieter i tested it local without isa tag and updateing failed, ignore versions, i use developer version of caja here https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/-7SsUQd3xvTNVG3dTWDe1g
Jun 12 11:52:53 <mhroncok>	raveit65: I said both isa and without isa

Jun 12 13:47:24 <dviola>	jcline: hi
Jun 12 13:48:08 <dviola>	jcline: I'm the guy who responded to your email: Regression: x86/tsc: Fix mark_tsc_unstable() -- let me know if I can help in any way with the issue
Jun 12 13:48:34 <jcline>	dviola, ah, hi!
Jun 12 13:49:31 <dviola>	I've got F28-WORK-x86_64-20180603-Live.iso from https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/live-respins/ today and I couldn't reproduce it on this machine either
Jun 12 13:49:38 <dviola>	so I'm curious if it's hardware related
Jun 12 13:49:53 <jcline>	Ohhh, interesting
Jun 12 13:49:55 <dviola>	although I didn't install it, just tested it from the thumb drive
Jun 12 13:50:21 <dviola>	it has kernel 4.16.13 iirc
Jun 12 13:50:59 <jcline>	Hmm. Well, if it is just race and a larger initramfs is enough to make it never happen I guess a thumb drive would be pretty slow
Jun 12 13:51:08 <jcline>	I'm grasping at straws a bit with that, though
Jun 12 13:51:36 <jcline>	I need to become in expert in initramfs generation, I think, but today's been busy :(
Jun 12 13:51:39 <dviola>	wish I had another HDD to install it, I'll see if I can find one
Jun 12 13:55:45 <jcline>	It'd be great if you could reproduce it - I was hoping mmarget would chime in, but maybe they're away
Jun 12 13:56:31 <dviola>	yep, I'll see about finding a new drive to install it
Jun 12 13:57:00 <dviola>	peterz wrote a series of commits including the one that is mentioned in the regression to address a suspend/resume with my machine, I remember experiencing a few hangs when testing the commits but it was fixed with other changes
Jun 12 13:57:25 <dviola>	you can find him on #kernelnewbies (irc.oftc.net)
Jun 12 13:57:40 <dviola>	I need to step back for a few mins, bbl
Jun 12 13:59:32 <jcline>	Cool, thanks again for looking at this
Jun 12 14:26:02 <CustosLimen>	hi
Jun 12 15:21:13 <dviola>	jcline: yw
Jun 12 15:21:15 <dviola>	I'm back
Jun 12 15:21:29 <dviola>	I'll install F28 on my T450, I wonder if I can be reproduced there
Jun 12 15:24:34 <dviola>	s/I/it/
Jun 12 15:26:58 <jcline>	Cool
Jun 12 15:36:30 <dviola>	it will take a while as I need to transfer some of my files, but I'll keep you posted :)
Jun 12 15:38:45 <rsc>	tibbs: I will try to have a look to the iftop thing at the weekend. No idea why I was credited, I just sent the link of the RHBZ to upstream and asked whether the patch there could be added upstream.
Jun 12 15:42:33 <jcline>	Great, no worries
Jun 12 15:51:00 <dviola>	jcline: I'm curious if this could be related? https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_F28_bugs#Certain_laptops_.28Lenovo.29_hang_randomly
Jun 12 15:51:39 <tibbs>	rsc: I'm perfectly happy to commit the patch and push out updates if you like.
Jun 12 15:54:53 <jcline>	dviola, it'd definitely be good to rule that out, but I think it can't be since that's been on since F28 was released. I'll comment on the bugzilla.
Jun 12 15:56:09 <jcline>	Plus I think *everything* freezes in that scenario, where-as here rcu_sched eventually gets upset and starts logging stuff
Jun 12 16:08:03 <dviola>	right, I'll keep that one in mind when testing
Jun 12 20:41:37 <tibbs>	I wonder what happened to https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/AnacondaLVMRAID
Jun 12 20:43:32 <tibbs>	Or whether it's possible to use lvmraid from the installer.  The logvol directive in pykickstart isn't documented to take a --type option.
Jun 13 04:56:25 <jubalh>	hi
Jun 13 04:56:37 <jubalh>	What is the right macro to use to have something run before %build phase?
Jun 13 04:56:39 <jubalh>	%pre ?
Jun 13 05:00:50 <tomhughes>	no, that defines a script to run before installation
Jun 13 05:01:29 <tomhughes>	the only thing that runs before %build is %setup but it doesn't really matter which of those you put something in - it's mostly just convention what counts as "setup" vs "build"
Jun 13 05:01:40 <tomhughes>	what are you actually trying to do?
Jun 13 05:25:16 <jubalh>	i have a configure script which checks whether a user certain user is present
Jun 13 05:25:35 <jubalh>	actually it doesnt seem to do anything with that info, just checking. so i guess i can patch this out and create the user in the %pre phase
Jun 13 05:26:30 <jubalh>	but in Makefile.in I also have $(INSTALL) -d -m 0755 -o $(RUNNING_USER) -g $(RUNNING_GROUP) $(DESTDIR)$(localstatedir)/run/piler
Jun 13 05:26:43 <jubalh>	and there it still fails because the user doesnt seem to exist
Jun 13 05:26:58 <jubalh>	if i understand %pre right the user should exist in %install phase?
Jun 13 05:30:23 <jubalh>	Or i need to patch this out too and in %files section set the attributes?
Jun 13 05:56:28 <tomhughes>	no %pre will never run during the build
Jun 13 05:56:55 <tomhughes>	and yes you need to patch that out and use %attr instead
Jun 13 06:04:49 <jubalh>	tomhughes: thanks
Jun 13 08:23:32 <mkrnstein>	petr123: ping
Jun 13 08:23:32 <zodbot>	mkrnstein: Ping with data, please: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/No_naked_pings
Jun 13 09:42:05 <tflink>	I'm looking at a review that has been silent for over 3 weeks now but the fedora-review flag is unset and the bug is not assigned to anyone https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1575601
Jun 13 09:42:37 <tflink>	are there any policy or etiquette issues with someone else taking the review in the interest of getting it done?
Jun 13 09:42:57 *	tflink can't think of any but figured he'd ask before doing anything about it
Jun 13 09:45:02 <rdieter>	tflink: if it's not assigned or flag set, imo to me, that means no one has formally taken it yet and is fair game
Jun 13 09:45:52 <tflink>	thanks for confirming
Jun 13 10:14:05 <bowlofeggs>	tflink: i agree with rex
Jun 13 11:13:02 <jubalh>	a question about binaries with suid bit set. is it possible that a upstream program ships with a coupe of binaries with suid bit set but actually when i remove it it still works?
Jun 13 11:13:12 <jubalh>	it depends on what the binary wants to access right?
Jun 13 11:13:40 <jubalh>	i'm looking at mailpiler (mailpiler.org) and it has like 5 binaries "needing" suid bit set
Jun 13 11:15:04 <tomhughes>	yes it will only need it if tries to do an operation that requries privilege
Jun 13 11:15:24 <tomhughes>	I find it hard to believe anything in that should need it... setgid mail maybe, but setuid?
Jun 13 14:24:17 <tibbs>	Freaking rpath.
Jun 13 14:25:39 <tibbs>	Interestingly, debian says that everything after libtool 1.5.2 shouldn't set RPATH but... that seems to not be trie.
Jun 13 14:25:45 <tibbs>	Or true, even.
Jun 13 14:26:09 <pjones>	"shouldn't" is a fun word.
Jun 13 14:26:29 <tibbs>	Well, "doesn't" is what they say, but....
Jun 13 14:28:05 <tibbs>	Heh, if I fix libtool to not use rpath then the test suite fails to run.
Jun 13 14:28:28 <tibbs>	Which doesn't make much sense to me, but....
Jun 13 14:32:21 <tibbs>	A quick LD_LIBRARY_PATH export fixes that.  I guess the test suite binaries need rpath set (to a nonstandard value) in order to find their libraries in the buildroot.
Jun 13 14:32:27 <pjones>	probably just means some test binary should have been run with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to wherever the libraries landed
Jun 13 14:32:32 <pjones>	yeah
Jun 13 14:32:47 <pjones>	so somebody just got that completely wrong is all
Jun 13 14:33:01 <tibbs>	I had it set for one of the test suites, but not the other.  Just moved it up a few lines and all seems to be well.
Jun 13 14:33:38 <tibbs>	Well that's at least a couple of rpmlint complaints done away with.
Jun 13 14:33:49 <tibbs>	W: crypto-policy-non-compliance-openssl /usr/lib64/libcyrus_imap.so.0.0.0 SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list
Jun 13 14:34:32 <tibbs>	I guess it's complaining about the default, though that's overridden in the default configuration files we ship.
Jun 13 14:35:35 <tibbs>	Or maybe it's not.  I'm not going to claim that I know anything about all what that's supposed to mean.
Jun 13 15:48:15 <adamw>	tibbs: on the face of it, it looks to me like the issue is that the software tries to explicitly set a list of accepted ciphers, when we intend to have a distro-wide policy on that.
Jun 13 15:48:47 <tibbs>	Basically, what it does is set the list of accepted ciphers to whatever the configuration file says to use.
Jun 13 15:49:42 <tibbs>	Assuming the configuration file says to use something other than the default.
Jun 13 15:49:44 <adamw>	i guess if it only does it if the user explicitly sets something in a config file it's probably okay.
Jun 13 15:50:17 <tibbs>	It would have to be OK; to have a server not able to set the acceptable ciphers would be bad.
Jun 13 15:50:38 <tibbs>	Pretty sure our mod_ssl packages still allow you to specify in the configuration file.
Jun 13 15:50:55 <adamw>	yeah, that's what i was thinking too.
Jun 13 15:51:11 <adamw>	note it's a warning, not an error.
Jun 13 15:51:30 <tibbs>	Now, I still need to check that there isn't some compiled-in default.
Jun 13 15:52:05 <adamw>	and that whatever config file we ship doesn't specify a list, i guess.
Jun 13 15:53:22 <tibbs>	Pretty sure it's acceptable if the config file specifies whatever magic gets you the system default.
Jun 13 15:53:45 <adamw>	sure. i mean, that it doesn't specify an explicit list, thus overriding the default.
Jun 13 15:54:01 <tibbs>	Not sure who to ask about this kind of thing, honestly.
Jun 13 16:41:21 <jcline>	Sorry for causing you extra work tibbs, this will teach me to be extra careful about which bugzilla account I'm using
Jun 13 16:41:31 <jcline>	tibbs++
Jun 13 16:41:31 <zodbot>	jcline: Karma for tibbs changed to 6 (for the f28 release cycle):  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/tags/cookie/any
Jun 13 16:42:01 <tibbs>	Not a big deal; it's just that unlike the old tool, the new one has no provision to ask about checks or let the person processing things override anything.
Jun 13 16:42:53 <jcline>	:(
Jun 13 16:46:22 <tibbs>	The tool right now is unfortunately really, really bad.
Jun 13 16:46:35 <tibbs>	If anything goes wrong it leaves everything in a half-completed state.
Jun 13 16:47:41 <tibbs>	And now zebob.m@gmail.com can't be mapped to a FAS user for some reason.
Jun 13 16:49:38 <tibbs>	I don't understand why it's failing now.
Jun 13 16:53:20 <tibbs>	jcline: OK, it should be done.
Jun 13 16:53:30 <jcline>	Awesome, thank you
Jun 13 16:56:25 <tibbs>	Now lets see if I can fix the one that got screwed up because I didn't have my ssh key loaded.

Jun 13 17:50:33 <sielicki>	I am trying to port an application to flatpak and get it on flathub.
Jun 13 17:52:07 <sielicki>	One of the things that requires is a valid appdata.xml file. I ripped it out of /usr/share/app-info/xmls/fedora.xml.gz, but it's failing a flathub test: you need to have a license stated in that appdata file, for the appdata file.
Jun 13 17:52:11 <sielicki>	I'm tempted to just throw a CC-SA in there, but that'd be wrong, because this is modified from the fedora project'
Jun 13 17:52:14 <sielicki>	and I can't just put my own license on something I stole.
Jun 13 17:52:15 <sielicki>	https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#spec-component-filespec
Jun 13 17:52:27 <sielicki>	That <metadata_license> tag is what I need to fill in, and it's even more complicated by the fact that they specifically say that copyleft licenses like the GPL are not allowed, possibly not even valid by the spec.
Jun 13 17:53:06 <sielicki>	But I am lead to believe that everything that is a part of the fedora project would be GPL, yeah? There is no <metadata_license> tag anywhere in the fedora.xml.gz file, for what it's worth.
Jun 13 17:54:17 <rdieter>	sielicki: if not otherwise specified, default fedora license is MIT
Jun 13 17:55:05 <sielicki>	That solves everything then. Thank you very much.
Jun 13 17:55:39 <rdieter>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement  from here
Jun 13 17:57:04 <rdieter>	sielicki: hrm, looks like MIT applies to code, this is likely considered closer to "content"
Jun 13 17:57:34 <rdieter>	so, CC-BY-SA supplemented by Moral Rights Clause Waiver and GPL Relicensing Permission
Jun 13 18:01:10 <sielicki>	Thanks for the help, I've pushed it.
Jun 13 19:22:05 <tibbs>	Oh, man, this package is rife with that old thing where a shell script is really a perl script.
Jun 13 19:25:20 <tibbs>	It just hurts my brain: exec perl -x -S $0 ${1+"$@"} # -*-perl-*-
Jun 13 19:26:26 <gholms>	Never really understood why those were a thing
Jun 13 19:26:30 <tibbs>	And then since the following line is #!perl -w, the -x switch does magic to start the script from that point.
Jun 13 19:26:58 <tibbs>	Of course, this is down after 50 lines of comments so I didn't notice it with a quick scan.
Jun 13 19:27:55 <tibbs>	gholms: I think it's just a much older equivalent of #!/usr/bin/env python
Jun 13 19:28:23 <tibbs>	From the days when people self-compiled perl and stuck it in some random location that isn't /usr/bin.
Jun 13 19:29:34 <gholms>	Did people not realize that "#!perl" works?
Jun 13 19:30:58 <tibbs>	I haven't a clue, honestly.  This old crufty method is still documented in perrun as if it is something that anyone should use.
Jun 13 19:32:10 <tibbs>	With even worse, deeper magic so that "#! -*-perl-*-" causes perl to think that a -p flag was passed (because "-*" is ignored for some reason).

Jun 14 12:57:18 <tibbs>	Then if I can figure out this bug, I'll fix it for you.  Though honestly I wish nobody here knew what ghostview even was.
Jun 14 12:57:46 <tibbs>	I should just symlink /usr/local/bin/gv to okular or something.
Jun 14 12:58:14 <tibbs>	OK, so it's one of the 326 packages I just installed....

Jun 14 13:49:53 <tibbs>	I'll fix it up for you and push an update.
Jun 14 13:52:50 <orionp>	thanks
Jun 14 14:16:34 <tibbs>	One thing I've always wondered about bodhi: is "Severity" relative to anything?  What would you set for a rather unimportant package which is completely nonfunctional without the update?  The severity of the fix is "high" or "urgent" for the two people who need the package, but rather low for the distro as a whole.
Jun 14 14:18:00 <tibbs>	The bodhi tooltip says only "How important is this update, really?" which could mean just about anything.
Jun 14 14:18:48 <lubko>	tibbs: my understanding was that it's only targetted at people who actually have the package installed, others are essentially not interested in that particular update anyway
Jun 14 14:19:19 <tibbs>	That's one way to look at it.
Jun 14 14:22:12 <tibbs>	On the other hand, if there's a releng person who might look at the list and think "this update is URGENT, I'd better do a push now" then, well, the one person who uses the package but didn't download the build from koji would appreciate it, I guess.
Jun 14 14:22:49 <tibbs>	orionp: I should have looked at the other bug before doing updates; it looks like a trivial fix as well.

Jun 28 15:31:27 <thm>	when I want to update a python package, where to do that? in the py37 side tag? in main rawhide?
Jun 28 15:36:48 <RaphGro>	thm: both.
Jun 28 15:37:27 <RaphGro>	it seems f29-python is currently the master for rawhide python
Jun 28 15:38:01 <RaphGro>	the super master *
Jun 28 15:39:33 <RaphGro>	thm: if that update is related to python 3.7 only, it's sufficient to build in the side tag only
Jun 28 15:40:06 <thm>	er, that does not make much sense
Jun 28 15:40:41 <RaphGro>	then please ask miro
Jun 28 15:41:23 <thm>	it's a package that sucessfully built for py3.7. now there is an update. making that in rawhide doesn't seem logical, does it?
Jun 28 15:43:05 <RaphGro>	maybe wait till the side tag got merged?
Jun 28 15:43:59 <thm>	probably the best, yes
Jun 28 18:02:23 <tibbs>	I think no phrase is more ignored in Fedora than "please test and give karma".
Jun 28 18:32:14 <netvor>	more than WHAT? can you finish the sentence?
Jun 28 18:35:59 <misc>	ah ah
Jun 28 19:19:36 <tibbs>	...
Jun 28 21:39:18 <DrNick>	it doesn't look like anything to me
Jun 29 08:26:44 <ndevos>	I think I followed https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_remove_a_package_at_end_of_life to remove a package from EPEL, but when is the package removed from the repo?
Jun 29 08:27:08 <ndevos>	it has been quite a while ago, ~3 months since https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/heketi/c/632c039cb07f6e1deb2f2bbebd51b14bbd6ba0a4?branch=epel7
Jun 29 08:44:22 <sgallagh>	dwalsh: I'd be happy to help walk you through modularizing CRI-O if you like.
Jun 29 08:48:44 <Son_Goku>	sgallagh, does modularity yet support co-installability?
Jun 29 08:50:08 <sgallagh>	Son_Goku: It does not support co-installability of streams of the same module. If you want that support, you would create a separate module.
Jun 29 08:50:22 <Son_Goku>	sgallagh, why?
Jun 29 08:50:37 <Son_Goku>	it should be reasonably easy to make that work
Jun 29 08:50:44 <sgallagh>	Son_Goku: No offense, but I really don't want to rehash 18 months worth of debate again.
Jun 29 08:51:01 *	Son_Goku sighs
Jun 29 08:51:13 <sgallagh>	The short answer is that there are so many edge-cases that break things that it's impractical to bother with. You may *think* it's easy, but it's not.
Jun 29 09:06:36 <dwalsh>	Son_Goku, THe way to support it is to run a container.  One container per different module.
Jun 29 09:06:46 <dwalsh>	sgallagh, Thanks could you point me to docs?
Jun 29 09:06:53 <Son_Goku>	dwalsh, containers are too fat
Jun 29 09:07:06 <Son_Goku>	and there a ton of other problems with it
Jun 29 09:07:06 <sgallagh>	dwalsh: I replied on the list, but I figured I'd ping you to offer direct help.
Jun 29 09:08:47 <sgallagh>	Son_Goku: parallel-installed modules can only work in a very limited subset of cases (e.g. python 2.6 and 2.7) where they have a completely disjoint set of resource requirements on the system. At which point, they're essentially an entirely separate project anyway.
Jun 29 09:09:47 <sgallagh>	Designing a mechanism to support this that only works on a very few modules is overkill and would lead to people misunderstanding and assuming they could do it for the general case... which would cause breakage and probably lead to people assuming that modules are bad tech.
Jun 29 09:10:24 <sgallagh>	The workaround for those limited cases is either to just create a new module for it or use a container... neither is terribly onerous.
Jun 29 09:12:09 <sgallagh>	Son_Goku: Remember that one of the goals of modules was to resolve the main problem with SCLs, which is that namespacing their filesystem locations meant that applications consuming them have to be modified to work with them. By dropping the namespacing, we commit ourselves to having everything in the default locations, which naturally limits our parallel-installability.
Jun 29 09:12:44 <Son_Goku>	so then why do we need separate metadata for them?
Jun 29 09:12:48 <sgallagh>	And it's not just limited to filesystems; what do you do if two streams of a module try to own the same socket file? The same well-known D-BUS name?
Jun 29 09:14:07 <sgallagh>	Son_Goku: I don't understand the question. Could you rephrase it?
Jun 29 09:14:43 <Son_Goku>	if they're only co-available, why do we need extra metadata sources and a whole extra set of tools for them?
Jun 29 09:14:54 <Son_Goku>	why not just make them versioned packages that just conflict with each other?
Jun 29 09:14:57 <sgallagh>	Because that's not the only thing modules do
Jun 29 09:16:01 <sgallagh>	1) They also indicate which of their components are "API" (meaning that if they're not on the list, the module maintainer is only committing to support that package as far as it's used with this module).
Jun 29 09:16:22 <sgallagh>	2) It provides the ability to indicate lifecycle which may differ from the OS itself
Jun 29 09:16:59 <sgallagh>	3) It gives us the ability to easily build the same content for multiple Fedora releases and provides us a way for people to upgrade without breaking their applications.
Jun 29 09:17:15 <sgallagh>	4) It does this with an approachable user experience.
Jun 29 09:18:44 <sgallagh>	This is just the set of things that immediately comes to mind. Over the last 18 months, a lot of people have worked on this design and we've come up with  something that works pretty well.
Jun 29 09:20:10 <sgallagh>	Also, based on Red Hat doing customer surveys, it was discovered that almost none of them actually cared about parallel-installability, because in most production setups, they have a dedicated container or VM for each purpose, rather than a monolithic system.
Jun 29 09:20:43 <sgallagh>	parallel-*availability* was far more desirable
Jun 29 09:48:28 <yaneti>	leigh123linux: hey, I've not check the irc window in a week. do you want me to add you to the vkmark package ?
Jun 29 09:49:13 <yaneti>	as a co-maintener
Jun 29 10:22:28 <aikidouke>	I'm packaging a mediawiki extension as my first package. The extension needs a configuration change in the main mediawiki config file, but should only be done if the mediawiki instance has been configured by an admin initially. Does that belong as info in the README or should the rpm attempt to make the config change?
Jun 29 10:40:38 <rdieter>	aikidouke: README

Jul 03 16:01:53 <tibbs>	I wonder how much I'd get laughed at if I asked for an rpm flag to parse specfiles but not expand $(...) calls that don't come from system macros.
Jul 03 16:02:56 <tibbs>	Would probably have to block lua, too.
Jul 03 16:04:51 <ajax>	%() surely, but that's not entirely insane
Jul 03 16:05:12 <ajax>	why would you need it?
Jul 03 16:06:01 <tibbs>	To attempt to make it safe to get source URLs out of a specfile.
Jul 03 16:08:22 <ajax>	yeah, that makes sense
Jul 03 16:08:43 <tibbs>	Obviously without %(...) (or lua) you can't parse some specs properly, but if we worked to make sure that most of the things you want it for were provided by the distro macro packages then that number could be pretty small.
Jul 03 16:09:15 <ajax>	especially if you only need enough of them to expand a URL line
Jul 03 16:09:37 <tibbs>	Yes.  Though it's still common to shell out to get a short commit hash.
Jul 03 16:10:00 <nirik>	I wonder how many specs use more than name and version in sourceurl...
Jul 03 16:10:03 <tibbs>	It just sucks to have to run everything that touches a specfile inside of a container.
Jul 03 16:10:22 <tibbs>	And it doesn't help that rpmlint's config file format is executable python.
Jul 03 16:10:37 <tibbs>	So you get a double hit.
Jul 03 16:10:40 <nirik>	really it should just be version... but I've seen a lot of name in there.
Jul 03 16:11:10 <ajax>	it's turing beartraps all the way down
Jul 03 16:12:07 <tibbs>	Pretty much, but I'm not looking to solve the halting problem here, just prevent a bit of arbitrary code execution.
Jul 03 16:14:16 <tibbs>	Then again, it's not that we can promise that system macros would be invulnerable to some kind of exploit.
Jul 03 16:14:37 <tibbs>	Anyway, loads of source URLs that use things other than %name and %version.
Jul 03 16:15:02 <tibbs>	%url is not uncommon, of course.
Jul 03 16:15:43 <tibbs>	Conditional things like %{?prerel}, sore, but there's plenty of arbitrary stuff.
Jul 03 16:18:02 <tibbs>	It's the specfiles that do Name: %name} that scare me.
Jul 03 16:19:04 <wwoods>	no self-referential structures. do you want a self-aware build system? because this is how you get skynet
Jul 03 16:29:00 <tibbs>	If someone can make a self-aware system in RPM macros then they deserve to take over the world.
Jul 03 16:30:21 <pjones>	if you can make a series of rpm macros that continues to be parsed correctly for more than 3 releases right now, you're probably in too deep.
Jul 03 16:31:02 *	nirik remembers back in the day looking at the towers of hanoi someone implemented in sendmail m4, understanding it and then backing away slowly. 
Jul 03 16:31:23 <pjones>	well, at least it was in sendmail m4, not sendmail.cf
Jul 03 16:31:41 <pjones>	so who wants to test https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/pull/1524
Jul 03 16:31:48 <tibbs>	I once wrote a set of rpm macros which reopened the FD that rpm had originally used to open the specfile, and then re-parsed the specfile and inserted data into the parse stream.
Jul 03 16:32:31 <tibbs>	I always found sendmail.cf easier to understand than the m4 stuff, honestly.
Jul 03 16:33:04 <ajax>	pjones: does the rawhide composes' netinst.iso not work for this
Jul 03 16:34:22 <pjones>	ajax: well, since it changes the code to make netinst.iso , no, not unless someone does a compose with a build of anaconda with that patch applied.
Jul 03 16:34:34 <pjones>	tibbs: same, really
Jul 03 16:34:42 <pjones>	tibbs: just both are horrible as well
Jul 03 16:35:18 <pjones>	ajax: you see, composes and anaconda builds is what I'm trying *not* to do :)
Jul 03 16:35:26 <ajax>	not willing to repack the iso yourself eh
Jul 03 16:35:35 <pjones>	I'm not as young as I once was.
Jul 03 16:35:35 <ajax>	(i do not in any way blame you)
Jul 03 16:36:27 <pjones>	I have put the days of doing distro composes in a hurry during a hackfest on my laptop behind me*.
Jul 03 16:36:31 <pjones>	(* I hope.)
Jul 03 16:36:44 <wwoods>	hey y'all guess what I suddenly find myself doing. figuring out how to reliably compose images that have anaconda in them (so they can install themselves)
Jul 03 16:37:06 <pjones>	wwoods: see above
Jul 03 16:37:16 <pjones>	wwoods: (particularly the PR)
Jul 03 16:37:59 <wwoods>	alas the answer is: "wow it sucks and somehow none of the tools that we use for this have gotten any better"
Jul 03 16:38:36 <ajax>	i see you've played knifey-software before
Jul 03 16:39:05 <pjones>	ajax: is that like seppuku?
Jul 03 16:40:15 <wwoods>	pjones: anyway it seems like it'd be sufficient to like. a) build an initramfs with the anaconda module, confirm the expected kernel drivers are inside
Jul 03 16:40:16 <ajax>	pjones: but without the rewards
Jul 03 16:41:08 <pjones>	ajax: ... okay so we taught the sand to do math by giving it the smallest bit of fire we can, and now we get to push it up a hill while committing seppuku forever.  got it.
Jul 03 16:41:33 <pjones>	wwoods: you see why I'm trying to farm this part out to others, yes?  What with I don't work on anaconda any more? ;)
Jul 03 16:41:45 <pjones>	anyway, also it's time for me to walk away from the keyboard.
Jul 03 16:41:46 <wwoods>	I mean, me neither
Jul 03 16:44:21 <ajax>	pjones: need to work an eagle eating your liver into that analogy
Jul 03 17:08:30 <tibbs>	I wonder if there's a dockerfile (or whatever it's called) for fedora packagers.
Jul 03 17:12:20 <smooge>	NOTICE: There will be a Fedora Infrastructure Outage today from 21:00 UTC - 01:00 UTC. (NOW) Central webservices and people/pagure will be updated and rebooted. https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issue/7065
Jul 03 17:15:21 <tmz>	tibbs: It's not really too much more than https://fedorapeople.org/~tmz/fedora-packager/Dockerfile.  That's a version of one I've used for various mock building and packaging work.
Jul 03 17:15:51 <tmz>	Maybe the container folks would be interested in helping to create and maintain images for packagers to use.
Jul 03 17:16:15 <tibbs>	Obviously I can just install what I need.
Jul 03 17:17:44 <tibbs>	But I haven't figured out how to make the container persist (if that's even possible) so it is annoying to continually reinstall fedora-packager.
Jul 03 17:18:35 <tmz>	tibbs: docker commit can save a container you created and built up manually.
Jul 03 17:19:16 <tmz>	It's preferable to build it from a Dockerfile though, as it's more easily rebuilt, edited, and version controlled -- of course.
Jul 03 17:19:43 <tibbs>	Don't really want to version control it, or rebuilt it or edit it.
Jul 03 17:20:15 <tmz>	Still, if you ever need to share it the Dockerfile method is much easier.
Jul 03 17:20:31 <tibbs>	I just want a way to safely test something, but not have to set it up all over again after I log out.
Jul 03 17:21:57 <tmz>	Then docker commit will do what you want.  Ideally you setup a container without doing work or pulling in unneeded bits before the commit, to keep the image leaner and quicker to start.
Jul 03 17:22:57 <tmz>	The defaults also set the max size relatively small if you try to build packages which take up a large amount of space.  For those, mounting a data volume where the building occurs is useful.
Jul 03 17:22:59 <tibbs>	I love how the docker commit manpage doesn't tell you how to actually use the thing after you've committed it.
Jul 03 17:23:33 <tibbs>	Then again, I guess manpages aren't really the way the docker people intended you to learn about things.
Jul 03 17:24:23 <tmz>	It's like git in a way.  If you opened a random git man page without having read any others, you likely would leave with more questions than answers.
Jul 03 17:25:00 <tmz>	When you commit, you're creating an image, so docker image would list it and docker run allows you to start a container from that image.
Jul 03 17:25:30 <tmz>	I have yet to look into the newer tools like podman and such.  I don't know if they're ready to replace the docker cli tools or not.
Jul 03 17:28:31 <misc>	podman is supposed to
Jul 03 17:30:28 <tmz>	Heh, yeah.  The question is how far along from 'supposed to' to 'does' is it? :)
Jul 03 18:09:38 <nirik>	halfline: was it you that mentioned stylish plugin to me? or am I misremembering? https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/02/stylish-browser-extension-steals-your-internet-history/
Jul 03 19:54:57 <smooge>	NOTICE: The planned Outage is over.
Jul 03 20:39:50 <smooge>	@f26eol
Jul 03 20:39:50 <fedbot>	Fedora 26 will go end of life and no longer supported on 2018-05-29 which is 4 weeks, 6 days, 4 hours, 39 minutes, and 50 seconds ago from now
Jul 03 21:29:07 <DrNick>	seconds ago from now is a unique time unit
Jul 03 22:08:38 <tmz>	Heh.  I thought at one point that past date issue was fixed in fedbot, but I guess not.  Maybe nirik knows if that's a regression or was never actually fixed.  I don't know where the fedbot source code lives, if it's available.

Jul 04 11:41:28 <smooge>	tmz, I don't know who runs fedbot
Jul 04 11:43:43 <tmz>	smooge: nirik is listed as the owner, that's why I mentioned his nick. :)
Jul 04 11:43:45 <tmz>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedbot
Jul 04 11:54:56 <smooge>	ah ok
Jul 04 11:55:41 <smooge>	I didn't see it coming from his domain so didn't put the 2 togehter
Jul 04 11:57:43 <tmz>	Thank you for taking a peak in any case.
Jul 04 11:59:07 <tmz>	I've casually looked for the source once or twice thinking I'd submit a patch for that issue, but never really chased it too far.
Jul 04 16:29:20 <nirik>	tmz: so, both zodbot and fedbot are supybot variants. Both are using the Limnoria package in Fedora/EPEL. The eol stuff are aliases, so not clear that there is something to fix in limnoria (But there might be)
Jul 04 16:29:30 <nirik>	fedbot: help f26eol
Jul 04 16:29:30 <fedbot>	nirik: (f26eol <an alias, 0 arguments>) -- Alias for "echo Fedora 26 will go end of life and no longer supported on 2018-05-29 which is [ elapsed [ until 2018-05-29 14:00 ]] from now".

Jul 04 18:37:14 <tmz>	nirik: Cool.  I knew they were supybot plugins but was not sure whether there was a bug in the code which produced the date.  It'd be nice if those could just set a date and have the plugin code do the right thing when it was future or past.  Thanks in any case though. :)
Jul 04 18:38:05 <tmz>	Being somehwat manual explains why I thought I'd seen it fixed for previous release eol aliases, at least.
Jul 05 05:21:19 <AquaL1te>	hi, would there be a reason against packaging gnome-games? it seems the licenses are nice, e.g. it's in the main repo of debian https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gnome-games-app. also some other distro's provide it: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Games/Documentation. but fedora seems to ignore this one since it got released with gnome 3.22. i could have a look next month to see if i can get it packaged.
Jul 05 05:21:25 <AquaL1te>	just checking here if that effort be worth it.
Jul 05 06:54:56 <Son_Goku>	jdieter, I guess this means I need to package zchunk for openSUSE now :P

Jul 05 07:49:51 <jdieter>	Son_Goku: looks good. You don't need the BR: gcc on openSUSE?
Jul 05 07:50:06 <Son_Goku>	jdieter, strictly speaking no
Jul 05 07:50:18 <Son_Goku>	they don't intend to rip gcc out of the buildroot
Jul 05 07:50:49 <Son_Goku>	also in Mageia Cauldron now: http://svnweb.mageia.org/packages/cauldron/zchunk/current/SPECS/zchunk.spec?view=markup&pathrev=1241850

Jul 05 12:25:50 <copart>	hi... rawhide is updated every night, right?  I been unable to see any updates on my Fedora 29 build for a few days now
Jul 05 12:27:12 <rdieter>	copart: in general yes, but the nightly compose does fail occasionally too
Jul 05 12:28:42 <copart>	rdieter: thank you, now I know the action is called compose.... #fedora-releng has a few compose failed messages the last few days
Jul 05 12:29:37 <copart>	pagure.issue.new -- dustymabe opened a new ticket dusty/failed-composes#498: "Fedora-Rawhide-20180705.n.0 DOOMED"
Jul 05 12:29:45 <copart>	I assume that is bad
Jul 05 12:47:06 <ajax>	of the 27000-some SourceN: lines with urls in fedora, over half are not https
Jul 05 12:58:58 <wwoods>	so hey, anyone know which kickstart actually gets used to make install images these days?
Jul 05 12:59:14 <wwoods>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_a_Fedora_install_ISO_for_testing sez "fedora-install-fedora.ks" but that no longer exists
Jul 05 13:06:25 <cverna>	wwoods: you should have a look here https://pagure.io/fedora-kickstarts/tree/master
Jul 05 13:06:52 <wwoods>	in https://pagure.io/fedora-kickstarts/c/2ab5ea67 ausil removed those kickstarts and says "install trees are now defined in pungi-fedora"
Jul 05 13:08:20 <cverna>	wwoods: did you check the pungi-fedora repo --> https://pagure.io/pungi-fedora/tree/master
Jul 05 13:09:08 <nirik>	note that the only install media we have left is netinstall/boot iso and the server dvd image.
Jul 05 13:10:26 <wwoods>	nirik: sure, and how does one build those for testing
Jul 05 13:10:54 <nirik>	pungi
Jul 05 13:15:24 <wwoods>	cverna: sure did, and that tells me how to build stuff inside the fedora infrastructure, but all I want to do is build a boot.iso. and do it outside the infrastructure.
Jul 05 13:16:36 <cverna>	yeah not very helpful
Jul 05 13:18:37 <FranciscoD>	The folks over at #fedora-respins may know. They produce updated ISOs every week or so
Jul 05 13:20:10 <nirik>	but all those are live I think.
Jul 05 13:21:00 <FranciscoD>	ah, yeh, probably are
Jul 05 15:11:37 <philipp64>	dumb question...  f28 is shipping libevent-2.1.8 but f27 is shipping 2.0.22... why such a discrepancy?
Jul 05 15:13:02 <smooge>	.whoowns libevent
Jul 05 15:13:03 <zodbot>	smooge: steved
Jul 05 15:13:22 <rdieter>	philipp64: possibly introducing a large version upgrade to f27 could be destabilizing
Jul 05 15:13:48 <philipp64>	that's what I thought, but it looks like the only real dependency is nfs-utils.
Jul 05 15:19:00 <smooge>	so steved did an update in January but it caused about 8 rebuilds which didn't work. He reverted it back and then waited until after f27 was done
Jul 05 15:19:17 <smooge>	no wrong set of releases..
Jul 05 15:20:32 <smooge>	so looking through the change logs... things listed needing rebuilds when libevent updates are 389-ds-base-1.4.0.5-1.fc28.5 nfs-utils and a couple other things
Jul 05 19:03:39 <gnat42>	hello, I have a quick question about spec files
Jul 05 19:03:53 <gnat42>	I started removing the %defattr macro that wasn't changing the defaults
Jul 05 19:04:13 <gnat42>	but I wasn't planning on rebuilding/releasing anything just committing and pushing to git
Jul 05 19:04:38 <gnat42>	but suddenly I wondered if I should be adding this change to the %changelog + bumping the release version. I presume not?
Jul 05 19:08:34 <nirik>	probibly you should. Or else they will all fail the mass rebuild next week...
Jul 05 19:09:51 <gholms>	Doesn't the mass rebuild already bump the release?
Jul 05 19:10:46 <nirik>	oh yeah, it does.
Jul 05 19:10:48 <nirik>	so you are fine.
Jul 05 19:11:11 *	nirik should get more coffee I guess. 
Jul 06 00:22:36 <tonyb>	I'm getting "Request is unauthorized." when tryign to upload new sources.  I haven't don that in $long_time.  Anyone able to help me debug what I've done wrong?
Jul 06 00:28:19 <airlied>	tonyb: kinit username@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG
Jul 06 00:30:19 <tonyb>	airlied: done, and kswitch -p no dice :(
Jul 06 00:31:23 <airlied>	tonyb: so just running fedpkg new-sources
Jul 06 00:31:35 <airlied>	tonyb: maybe run fedora-packager-setup
Jul 06 00:32:58 <tonyb>	airlied, just rm -rf'd ~/.fedora * and re ran fedora-packager-setup same deal
Jul 06 00:33:19 <tonyb>	airlied: it's on old packages as well as the up I adopted yesterday
Jul 06 00:34:41 <airlied>	tonyb: if I run fedpkg upload <file> without kinit, I get that error
Jul 06 00:34:56 <airlied>	when I kinit, I get "File already uploaded"
Jul 06 00:36:13 <airlied>	tonyb: make sure you have latest fedpkg
Jul 06 00:36:14 <tonyb>	airlied: strange. I'm kinda stumped
Jul 06 00:36:44 <tonyb>	airlied: nothhing in dnf update (fedpkg-1.33-2.fc28.noarch)
Jul 06 00:39:03 <airlied>	tonyb: it's not like a different username on fas vs local?
Jul 06 00:39:52 <tonyb>	airlied: I do have diffent username tony vs tbreeds
Jul 06 00:42:05 <tonyb>	airlied: adding --user tbreeds and I get the same thing
Jul 06 00:43:44 <tonyb>	Looks like my ssh config is wrong/invalid
Jul 06 00:43:59 <tonyb>	at least that's somethign to dig into
Jul 06 01:09:01 <tonyb>	airlied: It does seem to be krb related as that what's in the strace right before it fails
Jul 06 01:09:28 *	tonyb wonders if it's similar to the dns_canonicalise_hosts thingo from last year
Jul 06 05:28:32 <jim87>	Hello! I've created a spec file with a global variable (%global) named "srcdir". I can access it in the %prep section, but it's unset in the %build one... may you please explain me this behaviour?
Jul 06 06:30:18 <thm>	jim87: can you paste the spec file somewhere, e.g. to fpaste.org
Jul 06 06:30:45 <jim87>	thm: I've found a typo: used to bash I wrote ${srcdir} instead of %{srcdir} >.<

Jul 06 10:29:22 <redi>	oh good, the boost-python build is broken by upstream changes AGAIN
Jul 06 10:29:31 <redi>	I ****ing love boost
Jul 06 10:30:18 <redi>	especially their unique build system that keeps breaking things. love it.
Jul 06 10:30:29 <jim87>	Mmmm... I've built a binary which links to "libliteapp.so.1", which is in /usr/lib64/liteide/libliteapp.so.1, referencing libliteapp.so.1.0.0... but ldd says it's not found. Is there a way I can fix this?
Jul 06 10:30:44 <redi>	jim87: man ld.so
Jul 06 10:32:05 <jim87>	redi: being in /usr/lib64, I thought it'd be seen by ld
Jul 06 10:32:16 <redi>	it's not in usr/lib64
Jul 06 10:32:23 <redi>	it's in /usr/lib64/liteide
Jul 06 10:32:25 <jim87>	isn't it recursive?
Jul 06 10:33:00 <mizdebsk>	no
Jul 06 10:33:17 <mizdebsk>	libs in subdirectories of libdir are not searched by ld
Jul 06 10:33:35 <redi>	(this is not ld, it's ld.so)
Jul 06 10:33:46 <redi>	the dynamic loader, not the linker
Jul 06 10:34:37 <jim87>	mmm... in the directory I've built it, I can see the correct linkage (libliteapp.so.1 => /full/path/to/bin/./../lib/liteide/libliteapp.so.1)
Jul 06 10:34:48 <redi>	but ldconfig does not work recursively
Jul 06 10:34:57 <jim87>	does this mean that I should place it in /usr/lib/liteide, being the binary in /usr/bin?
Jul 06 10:35:18 <redi>	that suggests your binary has an RPATH using $ORIGIN
Jul 06 10:37:21 <jim87>	Awesome :)

Jul 06 11:12:18 <zbyszek>	What are you trying to do?
Jul 06 11:13:14 <redi>	zbyszek: local mock build -- so I need to tell it to use a local repo, whatever that command is
Jul 06 11:13:30 <kwizart>	gnat42, any issue not on existing bz ?
Jul 06 11:13:56 <redi>	--enablerepo local
Jul 06 11:13:56 <ignatenkobrain>	zbyszek: when is the next fesco meeting?
Jul 06 11:14:04 <sgallagh>	ignatenkobrain: Monday
Jul 06 11:15:04 <gnat42>	kwizart: just a question about opencv, any reason there's no el7 packages?
Jul 06 11:15:25 <gnat42>	like a technical one
Jul 06 11:29:21 <ignatenkobrain>	sgallagh: I wonder if https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/RemoveExcessiveLinking could be discussed there
Jul 06 11:29:29 <ignatenkobrain>	because I would like to get decision before mass rebuild
Jul 06 11:30:40 <sgallagh>	ignatenkobrain: If you didn't submit it before the "Changes requiring a mass rebuild" date, then it will probably be deferred to F30
Jul 06 11:30:55 <sgallagh>	Looks like it was only announced three days ago
Jul 06 11:31:22 <sgallagh>	Change Checkpoint: Proposal submission deadline (Changes requiring mass rebuild) was 2018-06-19
Jul 06 11:31:37 <ignatenkobrain>	sgallagh: well, it doesn't require mass rebuild... but desired
Jul 06 11:31:58 <sgallagh>	ignatenkobrain: It's not going to be part of the mass rebuild at this point
Jul 06 11:32:07 <sgallagh>	It's too late; they're starting the build today
Jul 06 11:32:43 <ignatenkobrain>	sgallagh: I think mass rebuild is planned for 11th, isn't it?
Jul 06 11:32:50 <ignatenkobrain>	we will start the mass rebuild on 2018-07-11
Jul 06 11:32:55 <ignatenkobrain>	from mboddu email
Jul 06 11:33:19 <sgallagh>	Ah, I misread that as today.
Jul 06 11:33:26 <mboddu>	sgallagh: Its on next Tur
Jul 06 11:33:32 <mboddu>	s/Tur/Tue/
Jul 06 11:34:10 <ignatenkobrain>	mboddu: 11th is Wed ;)
Jul 06 11:34:26 <sgallagh>	ignatenkobrain: Ask bcotton or jkurik to jump it ahead.
Jul 06 11:34:39 <sgallagh>	The process requires a week of public input before it gets to FESCo.
Jul 06 11:34:50 <mboddu>	ignatenkobrain: Right, my bad :(
Jul 06 11:35:03 <sgallagh>	But honestly, I'm -1 to short-cutting the process for a late submission.
Jul 06 11:35:28 <sgallagh>	I don't think the value exceeds the risk
Jul 06 11:35:46 <bcotton>	i'd defer to FESCo on this, but i'm inclined to agree with sgallagh
Jul 06 11:36:25 <sgallagh>	bcotton: I'm fine with asking FESCo to review it early, but I'm also noting that I'll be -1 on it if they do :)
Jul 06 11:37:41 <bcotton>	ignatenkobrain: what's the impact of implementing this after the mass rebuild?
Jul 06 11:38:30 <sgallagh>	bcotton: Only packages that manually rebuild will pick up the change.
Jul 06 11:38:45 <sgallagh>	Also, we don't resolve breakage caused by it at the same time as other changes.
Jul 06 11:39:39 <bcotton>	okay, that's what i figured. so it essentially becomes a partial implementation
Jul 06 11:40:42 <ignatenkobrain>	as far as I am aware, only very poorly designed libraries are affected by this and pascal ones... and given that most of other distributions use --as-needed I"m pretty sure it's not many packages which could break
Jul 06 11:40:55 <ignatenkobrain>	bcotton: yep
Jul 06 11:43:34 <bcotton>	i don't see a compelling reason to shortcut the process here, especially considering a lot of folks in .us and .cz are AFK part or most of this week. i think we should give it the week and then let fesco decide if it hits in f29 as a partial rollout or as part of a f30 mass rebuild
Jul 06 13:47:47 <rharwood>	what's the procedure for (friendly) change of package owner these days?
Jul 06 14:01:31 <labbott>	rharwood: maybe https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Orphaned_package_that_need_new_maintainers#Orphaning_Procedure except "give" to a person
Jul 06 14:29:24 <rharwood>	labbott: aha, thanks!
Jul 06 15:14:33 <sgallagh>	tomhughes: Can I pick your brain about an NPM 6.x packaging issue?
Jul 06 15:16:04 <tomhughes>	sgallagh: you can try ;-)
Jul 06 15:16:23 <sgallagh>	tomhughes: Context is https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1594647
Jul 06 15:16:28 <sgallagh>	.bug 1594647
Jul 06 15:16:29 <zodbot>	sgallagh: Bug 1594647 – npm Error: Cannot find module 'are-we-there-yet' - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1594647
Jul 06 15:17:50 <sgallagh>	I'm trying to figure out if there's a better way to resolve the issue I described in the last comment than replacing all of the symlinks with the original directories.
Jul 06 15:21:00 <tomhughes>	so why do the symlinks not work now the dependency is at the top level?
Jul 06 15:21:28 <sgallagh>	tomhughes: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_preserve_symlinks
Jul 06 15:21:40 <sgallagh>	That's the best explanation I can find
Jul 06 15:21:59 <sgallagh>	Some weird interaction with the module caching
Jul 06 15:26:56 <sgallagh>	tomhughes: I figure my two options are: "Remove all of the symlinks" and (just thought of this now) "add all the symlinks at all of the levels"
Jul 06 15:28:26 <tomhughes>	the odd thing is it is only supposed to affect peerdependencies but that's not what I'm seeing
Jul 06 15:28:39 <tomhughes>	though I'm seeing it on set-blocking not are-we-there-yet
Jul 06 15:30:17 <sgallagh>	tomhughes: 10.1 vs 10.5 in u-t
Jul 06 15:30:27 <sgallagh>	Same behavior, just whichever one gets reached first changes
Jul 06 15:30:31 <tomhughes>	ah
Jul 06 15:30:35 <tomhughes>	I'm on rawhide with 10.5
Jul 06 15:30:47 <tomhughes>	or at least that's where I'm looking at it
Jul 06 15:33:49 <sgallagh>	I'm trying to fix this up as part of updating to 10.6
Jul 06 15:34:41 <tomhughes>	I'm not clear how option 2 would work - for the modules that have nested modules you would create a dir instead of a link and then fill it with links?
Jul 06 15:34:58 <tomhughes>	but that would have to be all the contents not just child modules?
Jul 06 15:35:04 <tomhughes>	which seems horrendous
Jul 06 15:36:08 <sgallagh>	Well, I don't have a simple way of figuring out which ones it actually needs
Jul 06 15:36:51 <sgallagh>	But I was actually wondering if I could get away with just making the node_modules directory a symlink instead of individual subpackages
Jul 06 15:37:49 <tomhughes>	isn't that the same problem of having to swap between dir and link?
Jul 06 15:38:06 <tomhughes>	or it's easier in that direction?
Jul 06 15:38:19 <tomhughes>	but then if we ever wanted to unbundle you'd have to go back...
Jul 06 15:38:26 <tomhughes>	which is the whole point?
Jul 06 15:39:05 *	sgallagh sighs
Jul 06 15:39:24 <sgallagh>	Well, the nested ones shouldn't be an issue with debundling
Jul 06 15:39:45 <sgallagh>	Because they'd just stop existing in their current locations and appear in the global path anyhow
Jul 06 15:59:14 <tomhughes>	not sure I understand but frankly I'd say, why are pretending we are some day going to unbundle this again...
Jul 06 16:04:55 <sgallagh>	tomhughes: Yeah, I think I probably agree
Jul 06 16:09:11 <sgallagh>	tomhughes: Now I just need to figure out how to script that in lua :-/
Jul 06 16:09:24 <sgallagh>	... or maybe I'll just wait until after my vacation.

Jul 07 08:35:35 *	Topic for #fedora-devel set by dgilmore (Fri Apr 28 18:02:05 2017)
Jul 07 15:54:23 <WhizzWr>	hey there, I want to ask some question on how 3rd party library are build, do Fedora follows upstream default config, or what?
Jul 07 15:55:43 <WhizzWr>	I just found out when I install OpenCV-devel and VTK-devel from repo, then develop a program won't start.
Jul 07 15:56:42 <WhizzWr>	The cause is OpenCV is compiled against Qt5, and VTK is compile against Qt4, of course mixing them won't work, and executable will fail with "alloc pointer error" message..
Jul 07 16:01:19 <cstratak>	WhizzWr, I guess it depends on the package maintainer. Fedora tends to follow upstreams very closely but there might be differences of course. You best bet is to file a bugzilla against the component you are having trouble with, or contact the maintainer.
Jul 07 16:03:02 <WhizzWr>	@cstratak, I see, I mean the fix is simple, I just compile VTK from source and link against Qt5, but I imagine not everyone got the first idea to see ldd command to check if there are conflicting library getting linked..
Jul 07 16:04:27 <cstratak>	WhizzWr, it could be a case of the package being actually linked against qt5 in the development version of fedora and not on stable ones. That's speculation of course but it's something that happens from time to time.
Jul 07 16:16:45 <WhizzWr>	cstratak, I see I will see if I can fill bug report, because as I understand VTK latest stable default is linked with Qt5
Jul 07 18:42:25 <RaphGro>	is there any sense to commit+push a version 3.7.1 to rawhide if the 3.7.x series do not build in rawhide? but I would like to have 3.7.1 in f28 and f27 branches. currently all branches have 3.7.0
Jul 07 18:43:04 <RaphGro>	wondering how the changelog(s) should look
Jul 07 18:43:55 <RaphGro>	rawhide can get a version 3.8rc

Jul 09 10:56:39 <maxamillion>	nirik: +1 thanks
Jul 09 11:26:13 <nb>	tibbs, are you around?
Jul 09 11:26:58 *	nb is curious...... could i make a package that all it does is install some udev rules?
Jul 09 11:27:08 <tibbs>	Don't see why not.
Jul 09 11:27:22 *	nb wants to make a smartcard-udev-rules or something package
Jul 09 11:27:41 <tibbs>	Of course the question is why those rules don't just get sent upstream, but perhaps there's a good reason.
Jul 09 11:27:48 <nb>	tibbs, where should they get sent?
Jul 09 11:27:59 <nb>	yubikey rules are provided by ykpers
Jul 09 11:28:06 <tibbs>	Hmm.
Jul 09 11:28:07 <nb>	but the gemalto readers don't appear to be provided by anything
Jul 09 11:28:19 <tibbs>	I mean, we have 3dprinter-udev-rules and probably several others.
Jul 09 11:28:48 <tibbs>	Certainly putting them in a package doesn't hurt anything; it just seems that there must be some entity that would collect them all.
Jul 09 11:28:59 <nb>	yeah
Jul 09 11:29:16 <nb>	does it hurt if two udev rules files provide the same rule for the same idproduct?
Jul 09 11:29:22 <tibbs>	That I do not know.
Jul 09 11:29:37 <nb>	thanks
Jul 09 11:30:49 <nb>	tibbs++
Jul 09 11:30:50 <zodbot>	nb: Karma for tibbs changed to 10 (for the f28 release cycle):  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/tags/cookie/any
Jul 09 11:31:48 <tibbs>	As far as I can tell, it will run all matching rules.
Jul 09 11:32:08 <tibbs>	If ordering matters, note that files are processed in lexical order regardless of which directory they appear in.
Jul 09 11:34:15 <tibbs>	The only real caveat is that you probably want the name (not the full pathname) of the file containing the rules to be unique.  Identically named files result in one of the files being ignored; the precedence for that is based on the directory name (/etc first, then /run, then /usr/lib/).
Jul 09 11:34:58 <mhroncok>	nirik: I'll draft the comps proposal, however could you please answer https://pagure.io/fedora-comps/issue/290 so i knwo if tha one should be updated as well?
Jul 09 11:35:20 <tibbs>	mhroncok: The last of the python-rpm-macros updates should go out, so I can merge your PR today.
Jul 09 11:35:33 <mhroncok>	tibbs: ok, please do
Jul 09 11:35:48 <mhroncok>	does adding that to the macros chart require fpc vote?
Jul 09 11:36:40 <nirik>	mhroncok: yes, I meant to answer that. +1 to changing it...
Jul 09 11:37:05 <nirik>	well... I guess everything in there would already be installed.
Jul 09 11:41:18 <tibbs>	mhroncok: BTW, to which branches do you want that applied?
Jul 09 11:41:58 <mhroncok>	tibbs: well, for me new stuff has always been driven by rawhide
Jul 09 11:42:14 <mhroncok>	but having it available verywhere instantly, would be great
Jul 09 11:42:50 <tibbs>	Well, "instantly" is tough with a 2+ week delay for testing, but I can certainly push this out.
Jul 09 11:43:04 <tibbs>	Does "everywhere" include EPEL7?
Jul 09 11:43:56 <mhroncok>	and 6
Jul 09 11:44:12 <mhroncok>	if ti works there
Jul 09 11:48:49 <tibbs>	Well the "if" is what I was asking for you to tell me.
Jul 09 11:50:39 <tibbs>	We have macros.python3 there so I don't see why it wouldn't.
Jul 09 11:52:27 <sham1>	GNOME++
Jul 09 11:55:46 <mhroncok>	tibbs: it should work, maybe it also needs _other counterpart
Jul 09 11:56:02 <mhroncok>	tibbs: I can prep a PR for that as well
Jul 09 11:56:31 <tibbs>	There's no %py3_other on el6.
Jul 09 11:57:39 <mhroncok>	tibbs: but it might be needed on epel7
Jul 09 11:57:46 <mhroncok>	sorry for confusing the two
Jul 09 11:59:10 <tibbs>	Yeah, I do think it would be needed there.  Feel free to send a PR or I can take care of it.
Jul 09 12:02:35 <Pharaoh_Atem>	do we ever intend to transition python3 versions in EPEL7?
Jul 09 12:02:50 <Pharaoh_Atem>	it seems like we "planned" on it with python36, and then it didn't happen
Jul 09 12:06:09 <tibbs>	That's what the folks maintaining it in EPEL wanted.  I never saw a real need for it but it seems we're stuck with it now.
Jul 09 12:10:39 <nirik>	yes, it's not happened. we should do it.
Jul 09 12:16:13 <tibbs>	Though not to 3.6.
Jul 09 12:16:19 <tibbs>	At least I hope not.
Jul 09 12:24:02 <mhroncok>	Pharaoh_Atem, tibbs, nirik: the idea was to have python3_other packages built and later switch 34 to be the other
Jul 09 12:24:13 <mhroncok>	so far, there are no 36 packages, except maybe setuptools
Jul 09 12:24:34 <mhroncok>	once 34 is other, we could deprecate it and add 38 as the other in the future
Jul 09 12:24:39 <tibbs>	It seems foolish to put too much work into 3.6 at this point anyway.
Jul 09 12:25:03 <nirik>	sure, we could do 37 or 38 or whatever makes sense.
Jul 09 12:25:13 <mhroncok>	I'd focus on 36
Jul 09 12:25:28 <mhroncok>	it'll be a favorite one i guess
Jul 09 12:25:31 <tibbs>	So outdated at the start?
Jul 09 12:25:58 <mhroncok>	once we have everything set, we can talk about the cadency of updating the 3.N stacks
Jul 09 12:26:07 <mhroncok>	so far it seems very little people care
Jul 09 12:26:14 <tibbs>	I thought everything was set.
Jul 09 12:26:21 <mhroncok>	should be
Jul 09 12:26:31 <mhroncok>	how many 36 packages do we have?
Jul 09 12:26:35 <tibbs>	This whole mess of having the "other" things was to allow a slower transition.
Jul 09 12:26:41 <mhroncok>	yes
Jul 09 12:26:55 <tibbs>	I personally have zero interest in python3 for epel so I don't really know.
Jul 09 12:27:07 <mhroncok>	we obviously can say, ok since there has never been a real 36 stack, we are throwing it away and updating to 37
Jul 09 12:27:31 <mhroncok>	and than, in the middle of the transaction say let's throw it away and have 38
Jul 09 12:27:59 <mhroncok>	but I'd samohow rather stick to the original plan
Jul 09 12:28:25 <mhroncok>	my only concern for having python3 in EPEL is that people stop saying: but we need to use python2
Jul 09 12:28:44 <mhroncok>	and python36 is so much superior to 34 that it makes sense to try put it there
Jul 09 12:28:55 <mhroncok>	37 is not that much superior to 36 in my eyes
Jul 09 12:34:30 <carlwgeorge>	right now the biggest 36 roadblock for packagers is the lack of test things like pytest, coverage, nose, etc.  for example: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python3-coverage/pull-request/1
Jul 09 12:34:59 <mhroncok>	carlwgeorge: so the biggest roadblock is unresponsive maintainers
Jul 09 12:35:32 <mhroncok>	the procedure is tedious, but I say let's USE TI MORE
Jul 09 12:35:40 <mhroncok>	sorry, unintended capslock
Jul 09 12:35:45 <mhroncok>	use it more
Jul 09 12:35:54 <mhroncok>	tibbs: since you are here
Jul 09 12:36:08 <mhroncok>	tibbs: I wanted to discuss python guidelines for executables
Jul 09 12:36:11 <carlwgeorge>	right, unresponsive maintainers blocking maintainers that are trying to buy in to it more
Jul 09 12:36:39 <mhroncok>	tibbs: it bothers me that I ahve to have python2-virtualenv to have /usr/bin/virtualenv etc.
Jul 09 12:37:06 <mhroncok>	tibbs: the original idea was that this would change once /usr/bin/python is python3, but it looks like upstream wudn't allow theat after all (ever)
Jul 09 12:37:31 <mhroncok>	tibbs: would it make sesne to say python3 is the default executbale unless it would break user expecattions?
Jul 09 12:37:55 <mhroncok>	i.e. we would keep pip and python, but switch stuff like waf, virtualenv, whatnot...
Jul 09 12:38:06 <mhroncok>	note that many tools already do that, ingoring the rule
Jul 09 12:40:15 *	nirik was thinking we just do a mass rebuild when we want to switch in epel... but we would need to figure out the order. 
Jul 09 12:44:04 <mhroncok>	nirik: the think with other is that most specfiles don't have it at all
Jul 09 12:44:24 <mhroncok>	so if we say screw other, let's bump the python3 version at once, that'll work
Jul 09 12:44:37 <mhroncok>	it would involve a bit of bootstrapping, but definitivelty less than in Fedora now
Jul 09 13:02:36 <tibbs>	mhroncok: I think that should be taken on a case by case basis.
Jul 09 13:02:47 <mhroncok>	tibbs: exactly
Jul 09 13:02:50 <tibbs>	Right now the guidelines simply specify that the unversioned executable must be python2.
Jul 09 13:02:56 <mhroncok>	tibbs: yes
Jul 09 13:03:35 <tibbs>	That could certainly be relaxed, but in the case of virtualenv I would think that the unversioned executable should probably match the default python version.
Jul 09 13:03:47 <mhroncok>	tibbs: let's say it's up to the maintainer to decide how to make it, try following users' expecattions and fallback to python3 if you don't know
Jul 09 13:04:18 <tibbs>	Actually I think in basically any case I can think of where the version actually matters, you really would want it to match the system version.
Jul 09 13:04:45 <tibbs>	But you could do something with alternatives or wrapper scripts or something, I guess.
Jul 09 13:09:06 <mhroncok>	tibbs: that's the thing, what is "the system version"?
Jul 09 13:09:10 <mhroncok>	there is no system version
Jul 09 13:09:22 <tibbs>	 /usr/bin/python -V
Jul 09 13:09:25 <mhroncok>	there is just /usr/bin/python kept there for old farts to be happy :(
Jul 09 13:09:39 <mhroncok>	the whole "system" runs on python3
Jul 09 13:10:04 <mhroncok>	you don't even get /usr/bin/python when you install Fedora, since like F23
Jul 09 13:10:04 <tibbs>	The point is that you should be able to rely on what "unversioned python" means.
Jul 09 13:10:31 <tibbs>	Besides, I thought the existing guidelines were just following some PEP or another.
Jul 09 13:10:32 <mhroncok>	we are currently in a state that you have no idea
Jul 09 13:10:54 <mhroncok>	either you know what you are doing, an you run pythonX -m module
Jul 09 13:11:07 <mhroncok>	or you know Fedor a abit and run tool-3 or tool-2 expliclty
Jul 09 13:11:31 <mhroncok>	or you run tool and half the caseses you are confused that it is python2 based and the other half you are confused the other way around
Jul 09 13:12:39 <tibbs>	I don't think there's any good solution.
Jul 09 13:12:48 <tibbs>	But the stricture in the guidelines is probably outdated.
Jul 09 13:13:01 <mhroncok>	currently, if i follow the guidelines to the leterr a "tool" will run on Python 2 if it is also packaged for python 2, but it will run on Python 3 if the python 2 package is not there
Jul 09 13:13:39 <mhroncok>	I don't see a good solution
Jul 09 13:13:45 <mhroncok>	I just see that the current state is broken
Jul 09 13:14:22 <nirik>	rdieter: you around? I am trying to look at why calibre just quits for me... do you have any idea if  "QObject::disconnect: No such signal HeaderView::sortIndicatorChanged(int,SortOrder)" might be causing it? some change in qt5?
Jul 09 13:15:10 <mhroncok>	nirik: I've seen similar
Jul 09 13:15:30 *	mhroncok looks
Jul 09 13:16:12 <nirik>	mhroncok: not sure when it started, but it just starts up, I get the starting splash screen and then... it exits cleanly
Jul 09 13:16:22 <mhroncok>	nirik: here https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1597386
Jul 09 13:16:38 <mhroncok>	QObject::connect: No such signal SimplePythonEditor::marginClicked(int,int,KeyboardModifiers)
Jul 09 13:16:38 <mhroncok>	TypeError: connect() failed between (int,int,Qt::KeyboardModifiers) and unislot()
Jul 09 13:16:58 <mhroncok>	this is python3 tough
Jul 09 13:19:15 <nirik>	yeah, calibre is py2
Jul 09 14:24:16 <aikidouke>	I had my first package review, was asked to fix some things in the spec file. I've made those fixes and updated the original bugzilla ticket for the review. I dont need to open a new bugzilla ticket correct?
Jul 09 14:26:08 <mhroncok>	aikidouke: correct
Jul 09 14:26:44 <aikidouke>	ty
Jul 09 14:46:06 <rdieter>	nirik, mhroncok : have a PyQt5 update ready to push soon, I'm hoping that will help resolve it.  otherwise, we'll have to engage upstream (may not be a bad idea to do that earlier rather than later)
Jul 09 14:46:26 <nirik>	sure. happy to test.
Jul 09 14:46:39 <mhroncok>	I can test it as well
Jul 09 15:52:04 <thm>	ignatenkobrain: it would have been nice if you script had checked whether the spec file in question uses tabs or spaces.
Jul 09 15:53:11 <tibbs>	Hopefully nobody uses tabs anyway.
Jul 09 15:54:38 <thm>	there's no such rule afaik.
Jul 09 15:55:03 <tibbs>	Sure, but if you really want tabs, don't expect anyone to figure out how to work around that.
Jul 09 15:55:23 <thm>	ugh, that's an interesting position.
Jul 09 15:56:24 <tibbs>	There's one person who insists on five space tabs in his specfiles.  I'm certainly not ever going to care.  I will always use spaces regardless.
Jul 09 15:57:18 <nirik>	as long as folks avoid Zero width space. :) https://twitter.com/willkirkby/status/1016014401479041024
Jul 09 15:58:25 <tibbs>	Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
Jul 09 16:02:34 <thm>	nonetheless, it's not like we are in assembler ages. just teach your provenpackager script to respect such things. that's not rocket science.
Jul 09 17:02:07 <nirik>	Appologies to everyone on the failed s390x tasks. It should be fixed now. please resubmit.
Jul 09 17:08:34 <zbyszek>	ignatenkobrain: "Igor locuta, causa finita" — I like that

Jul 09 17:14:19 <ignatenkobrain>	tibbs: five space tabs? ;)
Jul 09 17:17:31 <ignatenkobrain>	yay, -12 packages from the buildroot! which means 134MB less to install in the buildroot
Jul 09 17:17:50 <tibbs>	How did you manage that?
Jul 09 17:18:11 <ignatenkobrain>	tibbs: just removed gcc and gcc-c++ ;)

Jul 09 17:20:21 <zbyszek>	ignatenkobrain: I just wrote a long mail on fedora-devel trying to argue why your change makes sense either way
Jul 09 17:20:39 <zbyszek>	but maybe I was too subtle
Jul 09 17:21:02 <zbyszek>	Anyway, good to see this done
Jul 09 17:21:25 <ignatenkobrain>	zbyszek++

Jul 09 17:21:38 <zbyszek>	ignatenkobrain: I'll want to talk to you about the packaging guidelines format change, but not today
Jul 09 17:22:06 <ignatenkobrain>	oh right, I should get to that at some point
Jul 09 17:22:17 <ignatenkobrain>	probably not this month
Jul 09 17:22:25 <ignatenkobrain>	I'm in process of changing job
Jul 09 17:22:47 <zbyszek>	oh
Jul 09 17:27:00 <ignatenkobrain>	zbyszek: btw, I don't see your mail in devel@
Jul 09 17:27:02 <ignatenkobrain>	did you send it?
Jul 09 17:27:10 *	ignatenkobrain shrugs
Jul 09 17:27:35 <tibbs>	zbyszek: If you want to talk about packaging guidelines, there are other folks around.
Jul 09 17:36:47 <ignatenkobrain>	tibbs: he wanted to talk about wiki→git transformation
Jul 09 17:36:53 <ignatenkobrain>	not about guidelines themselves
Jul 09 17:37:06 <ignatenkobrain>	mboddu++
Jul 09 17:37:38 <tibbs>	It's unfortunate that things didn't work out the first time that was tried.
Jul 09 17:39:48 <ignatenkobrain>	tibbs: we probably should convert it once more, push it and make wiki RO
Jul 09 17:39:53 <ignatenkobrain>	and do changes only in git
Jul 09 17:39:58 <ignatenkobrain>	and slowly get it nicer
Jul 09 17:40:06 <ignatenkobrain>	with restructuring and such
Jul 09 18:43:19 <ignatenkobrain>	nirik: https://pagure.io/fedora-comps/pull-request/293
Jul 09 18:43:39 <ignatenkobrain>	or mboddu ^
Jul 09 18:47:39 <tibbs>	Well shit, I got quoted in an LWN article.
Jul 09 18:48:17 <tibbs>	Now I just need to get some code in the kernel and I'll be set.

Jul 09 18:55:38 <mjg59>	ignatenkobrain: Well yes but you could also actually use IRC :p
Jul 09 18:59:50 <tibbs>	Finally catching up on fedora-devel mail.  Not surprised at all to see someone not actually reading my message and then complaining about the length of it.
Jul 09 19:09:56 <carlwgeorge>	I've got a legacy package I'm maintaining at my work that only contains rpm gpg keys.  Some of those are from my company, others from third parties like EPEL and Spacewalk.  It's currently marked as `License: GPL`, but that doesn't seem accurate to me.  epel-release is marked as GPL, but fedora-release is marked as MIT.  Anyone have any suggestions?
Jul 09 19:10:55 <tibbs>	A license for a string of random hex digits?
Jul 09 19:11:31 <carlwgeorge>	I know, right.  Just wondering what the best value for the license field should be.
Jul 09 19:13:16 <tibbs>	Well, assuming you can even place a license on a pubkey (which in any sane jurisdiction would not be possible) the Fedora licensing guidelines would say "GPLv2+ and  MIT and (whatever other licenses you have)".
Jul 09 19:13:50 <Pharaoh_Atem>	I think the assumption is that it counts as content
Jul 09 19:13:53 <Pharaoh_Atem>	so usually CC licenses
Jul 09 19:13:53 <tibbs>	And then document which files are under which license either in a specfile comment or a file included in the package.
Jul 09 19:14:18 <tibbs>	Pharaoh_Atem: The point is that he is taking files from other sources; he doesn't get to choose the license for them.
Jul 09 19:14:31 <carlwgeorge>	Ok so check the license of the corresponding release rpm from each project
Jul 09 19:14:43 <Pharaoh_Atem>	ah
Jul 09 19:15:04 <Pharaoh_Atem>	carlwgeorge: I believe distribution-gpg-keys vetted this already
Jul 09 19:15:28 <Pharaoh_Atem>	it lists all the key content it keeps as CC0
Jul 09 19:16:06 <Pharaoh_Atem>	though like tibbs says, I'm nto sure the string actually would be considered copyrightable
Jul 09 19:16:11 <Pharaoh_Atem>	it's almost exclusively functional
Jul 09 19:16:19 <tibbs>	CC0 is as close to "no license at all" as you can get globally.

Jul 10 08:19:02 <ignatenkobrain>	No packages are known to be affected by this downgrade.
Jul 10 08:19:04 <ignatenkobrain>	hmm
Jul 10 08:19:21 <ignatenkobrain>	then I'm giving up ;)
Jul 10 08:24:19 <lister86>	Hi, is kernel build support here or fedora channel?
Jul 10 09:31:28 <mcepl>	lister86: not sure, what do you need?
Jul 10 09:31:54 <mcepl>	pavlix: ping ... have a moment? PM
Jul 10 09:33:48 <amoralej>	sdasu user is trying to add a package to fedora in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1558683
Jul 10 09:34:24 <amoralej>	could he be sponsored to packager ?
Jul 10 09:34:40 <amoralej>	mrunge_, number80 ^
Jul 10 09:36:16 <mrunge_>	amoralej: wow
Jul 10 09:36:33 <mrunge_>	if the package is already in fedora, there is no need for additional review
Jul 10 09:36:43 <amoralej>	mmm, wdym ?
Jul 10 09:36:49 <amoralej>	no, it's not in fedora
Jul 10 09:36:53 <amoralej>	it's a new package
Jul 10 09:37:08 <mrunge_>	amoralej: the current maintainer needs to update the package. that's it
Jul 10 09:37:26 <amoralej>	there is no current package, it's a new one
Jul 10 09:37:36 <amoralej>	as cisco deprecated old module and create a new one
Jul 10 09:37:50 <amoralej>	or are we doing everything wrong :)
Jul 10 09:37:59 <mrunge_>	and the previous was not in fedora yet?
Jul 10 09:38:10 <amoralej>	yes, previous was in fedora
Jul 10 09:38:17 <amoralej>	but it's a diferent module
Jul 10 09:38:22 <amoralej>	not a new version of the same
Jul 10 09:38:29 <mrunge_>	with a different acronym, apparently
Jul 10 09:38:41 <amoralej>	yes, and different namespace and not compatible
Jul 10 09:38:41 <mrunge_>	err, name
Jul 10 09:38:50 <mrunge_>	got you
Jul 10 09:38:55 <amoralej>	new one will not provide or obsolete old one
Jul 10 09:39:41 <mrunge_>	amoralej: the question was more: is this a real new package and a new package review then including sponsorship and stuff
Jul 10 09:40:29 <amoralej>	i think this is a real new package, yes
Jul 10 09:40:41 <amoralej>	the problem is that the maintainer for old one seems not to be active anymore
Jul 10 09:40:47 <mrunge_>	yes
Jul 10 09:40:48 <amoralej>	so a new one is needed
Jul 10 09:41:09 <amoralej>	i added blocker FF-NEEDSPONSOR blocker
Jul 10 09:41:09 <mrunge_>	so: does the new package support python3?
Jul 10 09:41:24 <amoralej>	it will in next release, iirc
Jul 10 09:41:31 <amoralej>	i remember we discussed this
Jul 10 09:41:36 <amoralej>	let me check again
Jul 10 09:41:50 <mrunge_>	amoralej: the issue is: python2 is not supported anymore in fedora
Jul 10 09:41:54 <amoralej>	this is being a log process
Jul 10 09:42:12 <amoralej>	oh, i thought we could still use python2 :(
Jul 10 09:42:27 <mrunge_>	amoralej: while it is still there, I would not approve a python package without python3
Jul 10 09:42:54 <mrunge_>	amoralej: next issue: I'd really like to see checks passing
Jul 10 09:43:09 <amoralej>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1558683#c20
Jul 10 09:43:45 <amoralej>	let me check if a new release has been created since then
Jul 10 09:45:15 <amoralej>	i see fixes for python3 in master trunk
Jul 10 09:49:25 <amoralej>	thanks mrunge_ i'll work with the maintainer to get a python3 ready release
Jul 10 09:49:46 <mrunge_>	ack, thank you amoralej. I'll add my other nits to the ticket
Jul 10 09:50:05 <amoralej>	thanks a bunch mrunge_ !
Jul 10 10:06:55 <amoralej>	mrunge_, btw, i'm having issues building kubernetes in koji with f28 (not related to 3.7) but working in mockbuild
Jul 10 10:06:55 <amoralej>	https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/8198/27998198/build.log
Jul 10 10:07:05 <amoralej>	RuntimeError: can't start new thread
Jul 10 10:07:13 <amoralej>	does it rings you a bell?
Jul 10 10:07:25 <amoralej>	something specific to build environment?
Jul 10 10:08:22 <number80>	amoralej: compare what's installed in root.log
Jul 10 10:08:39 <number80>	could be an updated dependency
Jul 10 10:08:48 <amoralej>	i was thinking in something related to limits in the number of threads
Jul 10 10:08:50 <amoralej>	or something
Jul 10 10:08:51 <amoralej>	number80,
Jul 10 10:09:05 <amoralej>	do you know of some limits set in koji?
Jul 10 10:09:32 <mrunge_>	amoralej: there *are* limits
Jul 10 10:09:39 <amoralej>	it creates a bunch of threads
Jul 10 10:09:43 <mrunge_>	but you shouldn't really hit them
Jul 10 10:09:48 <number80>	very rare indeed
Jul 10 10:10:01 <number80>	usually, when it happens a lot of builds fail at the same time
Jul 10 10:10:02 <amoralej>	1656 as per my current local test
Jul 10 10:10:30 <amoralej>	threads for a the nosetests process
Jul 10 10:10:51 <mrunge_>	amoralej: you did not list all dependencies, as it seems
Jul 10 10:10:52 <amoralej>	ok, i'll try to compare buildroots
Jul 10 10:11:06 <mrunge_>	amoralej: NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0xf5e6a26c>: Failed to establish a new connection:
Jul 10 10:11:15 <mrunge_>	something liks this is always suspicious
Jul 10 10:11:41 <mrunge_>	koji is not allowed to pull stuff from the net
Jul 10 10:12:03 <amoralej>	mrunge_, i find similar messages for the passing build
Jul 10 10:13:03 <mrunge_>	amoralej: so it looks like the build finally fails, because of those 696 errors in the test suite
Jul 10 10:13:13 <amoralej>	yes
Jul 10 10:13:33 <mrunge_>	amoralej: two options: skip tests, or fix build
Jul 10 10:13:46 <amoralej>	yeah, i'm trying to fix the build
Jul 10 10:13:51 <amoralej>	but can't find root cause
Jul 10 10:13:54 <mrunge_>	amoralej: *sometimes*, tests require a network connection, or a running server
Jul 10 10:13:58 <amoralej>	and as i can't reproduce it locally
Jul 10 10:14:02 <amoralej>	makes it hard
Jul 10 10:14:16 <mrunge_>	probably your local mockbuild is allowed to connect to the network?
Jul 10 10:14:18 <amoralej>	in fact, the same spec and release worked
Jul 10 10:14:21 <amoralej>	mmmm
Jul 10 10:14:32 <amoralej>	i'm not sure
Jul 10 10:14:33 <number80>	can't start a new thread is misleading, actually it is multiprocessing, so no real threads but actual processes
Jul 10 10:14:58 <number80>	add --offline to your mock command
Jul 10 10:15:52 <amoralej>	i'm using fedpkg mockbuild
Jul 10 10:16:00 <number80>	ha no caching
Jul 10 10:23:40 <mrunge_>	amoralej: when running tests, that mostly requires to mirror runtime requirements for tests as well
Jul 10 10:24:15 <mrunge_>	amoralej: i.e. runtime requirements need to get listed as buildrequires again
Jul 10 10:25:11 <amoralej>	mrunge_, yeah, i know, but same spec works in a previous build in f28 https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1022778
Jul 10 10:25:18 <amoralej>	i thing BRs are correct
Jul 10 10:25:21 <amoralej>	but still checking
Jul 10 10:25:32 <mrunge_>	amoralej: and ftr, python-kubernetes fails for me on local mockbuild, it uses async
Jul 10 10:25:43 <amoralej>	mrunge_, that's f29
Jul 10 10:25:51 <mrunge_>	amoralej: I don't see python-dateutil for example as br
Jul 10 10:25:57 <amoralej>	yes, i've reported it and i'm trying to get a fix
Jul 10 10:25:58 <mrunge_>	or google-auth
Jul 10 10:26:06 <amoralej>	but in f28 it works
Jul 10 10:26:20 <amoralej>	i think that's unrelated to current failure, tbh
Jul 10 10:26:22 <mcepl>	pavlix: ping?
Jul 10 10:26:25 <zodbot>	mcepl: Ping with data, please: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/No_naked_pings
Jul 10 10:26:31 <amoralej>	mrunge_, see that it's failing in f28
Jul 10 10:26:45 <mcepl>	zodbot: shut up, I did couple of minutes ago
Jul 10 10:27:43 <amoralej>	error with missing BRs are usually very clear
Jul 10 10:41:35 <amoralej>	number80, the same spec works in x86_64 builder and always fails in i686
Jul 10 10:42:40 <amoralej>	mrunge_, ^ o_O
Jul 10 10:43:31 <mrunge_>	amoralej: well, the connection attempts *are* clear
Jul 10 10:43:46 <amoralej>	mrunge_, all those messages are not actual errors
Jul 10 10:43:48 <mrunge_>	but other than that, it's still noarch, no?
Jul 10 10:43:52 <amoralej>	jobs are passing with that
Jul 10 10:44:10 <amoralej>	yes, but i've checked that, if the build is done in a i686 machine it fails
Jul 10 10:44:17 <amoralej>	if it's in x86_64 it passes
Jul 10 10:44:45 <amoralej>	something arch specific in multithread
Jul 10 10:45:13 <mrunge_>	while you can hammer a nail into the wall using a drill machine, this is still not recommended and will crash your tool at some point
Jul 10 10:45:49 <amoralej>	opening wordreference :)
Jul 10 10:46:43 <amoralej>	sorry mrunge_ i'm not sure how to interpret that
Jul 10 10:47:27 <mrunge_>	amoralej: I was saying: it works is a hint, that something is ok, but it still can be scary
Jul 10 10:47:27 <number80>	amoralej, mrunge_ I've been testing builds and same connection error but it does not fail, tests are skipped
Jul 10 10:47:34 <mrunge_>	to some extent
Jul 10 10:47:53 <amoralej>	i think the connection errors must be tests that expect connections to fail
Jul 10 10:48:05 <amoralej>	i don't see skipped tests
Jul 10 10:48:09 <amoralej>	so expected failures
Jul 10 10:48:22 <number80>	amoralej: in reports, it says some tests are skipped
Jul 10 10:48:26 <amoralej>	mmm
Jul 10 10:48:32 <mrunge_>	right, same for me
Jul 10 10:48:37 <amoralej>	let me check it again, i probably missread it then
Jul 10 10:48:37 <mrunge_>	but more failures
Jul 10 10:48:39 <number80>	I'll test i686 builds
Jul 10 10:48:56 <amoralej>	3 sip
Jul 10 10:49:03 <amoralej>	3 skip, yeah
Jul 10 10:49:37 <amoralej>	in fact, errors are right before a "S" test, so yes, it must be siping it because of failed connection
Jul 10 10:51:19 <callkalpa>	I am trying to do fedpkg build and I get this error https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/HmUScXst0FRYDiWybpCbcQ
Jul 10 10:51:26 <callkalpa>	I have also logged in with kinit
Jul 10 11:00:49 <number80>	I have a reproducer on i386
Jul 10 11:03:00 <amoralej>	number80, yeah, me too using fedpkg mockbuild --root fedora-28-i386
Jul 10 11:03:01 <amoralej>	good
Jul 10 11:03:09 <amoralej>	that's a good starting point to investigate
Jul 10 11:03:32 <amoralej>	and it happens in both python2 and python3
Jul 10 11:09:55 <number80>	Damn, python-k8s is unreadable, a lot of stuff is generated
Jul 10 11:16:59 <number80>	I have a theory: code has changed and we have Pool objects leak so since limits are higher on x86_64, it only bites us on i386
Jul 10 11:17:28 <number80>	3.7 has some changes related to that so it can explain why it doesn't hit us on rawhide
Jul 10 11:18:16 <thm>	nirik: care to give karma here: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/python-jinja2-2.10-3.fc27 ?
Jul 10 11:26:49 <number80>	amoralej: I confirmed my theory, it only depends on the number of tests ran before
Jul 10 11:36:17 <number80>	I have an idea of how to solve it but since code is generated, I would simply add %ifarch i386 to disable test on i386 and create a ticket upstream
Jul 10 11:36:39 *	number80 hates generated code
Jul 10 11:38:45 <amoralej>	number80, did you check it's leaking threads?
Jul 10 11:39:13 <number80>	amoralej: it's leaking process pools
Jul 10 11:39:26 <amoralej>	ok
Jul 10 11:39:32 <number80>	so the fix should be deleting process pools in teardown in all test classes
Jul 10 11:39:54 <number80>	but there are a lot to fix and no guarantee it will be upstream as code is generated
Jul 10 12:01:05 <amoralej>	number80, ok, i'll add the conditional wit i386
Jul 10 12:01:13 <number80>	ack
Jul 10 12:01:23 <amoralej>	thanks for your help number80 mrunge_
Jul 10 12:01:32 <amoralej>	number80++ mrunge_++

Jul 10 14:02:10 <labbott>	sgallagh: is there an existing bugzilla tracking upgrade failure from stable -> rawhide due to a lack of modular repo? I get failure for "failed to synchronize cache" and have to change the module repos to skip if unavailble
Jul 10 14:12:54 <tachoknight__>	hi all, i remember this coming up and i've been looking for info, but if i'm trying to build a package in rawhide that invokes 'python', i get an error that 'python' can't be found
Jul 10 14:13:38 <tachoknight__>	using mock, i see python getting installed but i guess the symlink doesn't get created as part of it
Jul 10 14:14:06 <eclipseo>	should invoke pythor2 or python3 not python alone, no?
Jul 10 14:14:09 <tachoknight__>	i tried aliasing, but that doesn't seem to help
Jul 10 14:14:56 <tomhughes>	well you want to be fixing your package not to do that anyway
Jul 10 14:15:30 <tomhughes>	last I knew python was a script that warned when building under rpm to specify which pyhton you meant but maybe it has gone away completely now?
Jul 10 14:15:31 <tmz>	Indeed, ideally you'd use a specific python.  But the lack of /usr/bin/python is due to https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Move_usr_bin_python_into_separate_package
Jul 10 14:15:49 <tomhughes>	ah ok
Jul 10 14:16:08 <tachoknight__>	okay
Jul 10 14:16:31 <tachoknight__>	yes, i'm changing it, but there's a *lot* of python calls :)
Jul 10 14:17:03 <tachoknight__>	sed'ing and awk'ing isn't of much help here, so it's just grep'ing and doing it all by hand
Jul 10 14:17:41 <tmz>	The source doesn't allow setting the path to python via some make variable or configure flag?
Jul 10 14:18:35 <tachoknight__>	in some places it does
Jul 10 14:19:19 <tmz>	And others it does not?  So it's just half-assed upstream? :/
Jul 10 14:19:38 <tomhughes>	in other news the earth is spherical
Jul 10 14:19:43 <tomhughes>	ish
Jul 10 14:19:44 <tachoknight__>	more-or-less :)
Jul 10 14:20:05 <tmz>	tomhughes: Haha.  Yeah, I'm not even remotely surprised.
Jul 10 14:21:07 <eclipseo>	tachoknight__: have you tried adding %global __python %{__python3}
Jul 10 14:21:30 <tomhughes>	well that will only work for things in the spec, which are easy to fix
Jul 10 14:27:21 <tachoknight__>	as an aside, if i can do a one-liner search-n-replace in the spec, that's okay, right? (i.e. not have to create multiple patch files)
Jul 10 14:34:12 <eclipseo>	tachoknight__: you should probably manage it with a sed one liner

Jul 11 10:58:11 <jsmith>	sgallagh: Short version: npm in rawhide seems to fail to bring in some dependencies that it needs
Jul 11 11:03:36 <tomhughes>	see discussion from a few days ago...
Jul 11 11:05:10 <rdieter>	Anyone with python-fu riddle me (or help debug) this?  https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/3523/28133523/build.log    PyQt5 build is failing for python2, python2 -c 'from PyQt5 import sip' fails with "ImportError: No module named PyQt5", but /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/PyQt5/sip.so most definitely exists (and this works on f28)
Jul 11 11:05:22 <rdieter>	(the python3 build that does the same is ok)
Jul 11 11:07:41 <rdieter>	ok, nevermind, python2 fails on fc28 too, once I ensured usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/PyQt5/__init__.py (and friends) was no longer present
Jul 11 11:07:56 *	rdieter goes to poke upstream

Jul 11 11:28:51 <zbyszek>	larsks: open a ticket on the sponsors' pagure repo and say that you want him as a co-maintainer
Jul 11 11:29:03 <zbyszek>	needs to have a fas account of course
Jul 11 11:29:08 <larsks>	Yes, that's all set.
Jul 11 11:29:55 <larsks>	zbyszek: is https://pagure.io/packager-sponsors the appropriate repo for the request?

Jul 16 09:16:58 <bcotton>	rwmjones: i guess lady macbeth finally got rid of him
Jul 16 09:20:39 <jsmith>	I think he's on vacation, if I remember correctly
Jul 16 09:20:53 <jsmith>	I think I saw something to that effect on social media over the weekend, but I could be wrong
Jul 16 09:24:05 <rwmjones>	ok thx
Jul 16 10:21:48 <sgallagh>	Hmm, I have a golang package which builds fine on F28, but on Rawhide fails with "Missing build-id in /builddir/build/BUILDROOT/hub-2.5.0-1.fc29.x86_64/usr/bin/hub". Everything else works the same. Did something break with debugsource generation?
Jul 16 10:35:41 <sgallagh>	jcajka: ^^ ?
Jul 16 10:45:20 <eclipseo>	All my Go binary packages fail with Empty debugsourcefiles.list in F29
Jul 16 10:52:11 <tyll>	nirik: I will not make it for the meeting
Jul 16 10:56:22 <jcajka>	sgallagh: it should be related to changes in gdb debuginfo generation, there should be macro that disables that check(as Go is not generating GNU build-id by default), I can't recall it from top of my head, I'm looking for it but mjw should know it
Jul 16 10:57:30 <sgallagh>	jcajka: Was there a devel-announce message about this change? A Change Proposal?
Jul 16 10:58:06 <sgallagh>	If this is going to break all Golang packages... there needs to be some coordination done
Jul 16 10:58:29 <jcajka>	sgallagh: no idea IIRC it has been around since f28/27-ish
Jul 16 10:58:50 <sgallagh>	jcajka: The macro might have been, but builds weren't failing
Jul 16 10:59:09 <jcajka>	sgallagh: not all, just all that generat debuginfos and don't have gnu build id set via ldflags
Jul 16 10:59:09 <nirik>	tyll: ok. (although zbyszek was chair today I thought)
Jul 16 10:59:34 <jcajka>	sgallagh: IIRC they have been, or it might have been just rawhide.... hm...
Jul 16 11:00:09 <sgallagh>	jcajka: OK, so where are the guidelines saying "Here's how to generate build-id" or "Here's how you work around it if you can't modify ldflags"?
Jul 16 11:00:59 <sgallagh>	Hmm, actually: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingDrafts/Go#Build_ID
Jul 16 11:02:34 <sgallagh>	Ah, but it requires the %gobuild macro, which my package can't use because it has its own frankensteing build setup :-/
Jul 16 11:03:15 <sgallagh>	jcajka, mjw: I don't see the workaround macro on that page, though
Jul 16 11:04:23 <jcajka>	sgallagh: ah.. for got about it, jchaloupka wrote it, it should probably mention that there is macro to bypass that check(or I hope it is still there)
Jul 16 11:04:59 <jcajka>	sgallagh: you could probably try the LDFLAG approach or you can hack the scripts
Jul 16 11:05:25 <sgallagh>	_missing_build_ids_terminate_build maybe?
Jul 16 11:05:59 <jcajka>	sgallagh: yeah, just has been searching for it, asking around
Jul 16 11:09:20 <sgallagh>	jcajka: Oh, hmm. Looks like I discovered this at some time in the past, because this package already has "%undefine _missing_build_ids_terminate_build" specified... so it must have stopped working in F29 :-(
Jul 16 11:11:32 <jcajka>	sgallagh: hm... I will try to ask around if we can get it back
Jul 16 11:11:37 <sgallagh>	OK, thanks
Jul 16 11:11:44 <sgallagh>	I guess I'll see if I can hack the LDFLAGS
Jul 16 11:52:35 <sgallagh>	jcajka: I got the ldflags fixed (and it builds on F28 now without the workaround set). However, the same SRPM still won't build on F29, now with "Empty %files file /builddir/build/BUILD/hub-2.5.0/debugsourcefiles.list"
Jul 16 11:54:38 <maxamillion>	bexelbie: ping - any updates on this? https://pagure.io/flock/issue/71
Jul 16 11:54:47 <maxamillion>	it's been a couple weeks
Jul 16 11:56:53 <copart>	eclipseo: same here, I had to add "%global debug_package %{nil}" before prep until I figure out a better fix

Jul 16 12:13:24 <tibbs>	I will re-run the report but I certainly don't want to get into a revert war.
Jul 16 12:14:00 <tibbs>	If there aren't too many packages, I'll see if I somehow didn't fix them originally or if they were re-added.  If the latter, I should file bugs.
Jul 16 12:14:07 <mhroncok>	I just, there is not even a commit message
Jul 16 12:14:26 <tibbs>	Probably just passive aggression.
Jul 16 12:14:56 <mhroncok>	I just touched catfish, because it goes extraordinary efforst to ship catfish-py2 and catfish-py3
Jul 16 12:14:59 <mhroncok>	it's a desktop app
Jul 16 12:15:14 <tibbs>	Well if you're touching it, I guess you could take it back out.

Jul 16 12:15:31 <mhroncok>	but I'm curious how thta PR will be taken
Jul 16 12:16:00 <tibbs>	Like most PRs, it will probably be ignored.
Jul 16 12:17:41 <mhroncok>	well I tend to bump PRs and later merge them if nobody says no
Jul 16 12:18:03 <mhroncok>	that reminds me to go trough them :)
Jul 16 12:18:41 <tibbs>	Yeah, some easy reminder of your open PRs would be good to have.
Jul 16 12:18:58 <mhroncok>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/user/tibbs/requests
Jul 16 12:19:10 <tibbs>	Yeah, but I have to remember to go to a web page.
Jul 16 12:19:53 <mhroncok>	tibbs: I wonder whether we could extend the noresponsive policy for PRs
Jul 16 12:20:05 <mhroncok>	cc zbyszek: ^
Jul 16 12:20:07 <nirik>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/user/<yourfaslogin>/requests
Jul 16 12:46:42 <jcajka>	sgallagh: sorry, but really don't know much about he debuginfo scripts, the macro _missing_build_ids_terminate_build should be still working according to mjw, if not we should file a bug(I guess it might be good idea even for the issue that you are currently running in to)
Jul 16 12:47:35 <jcajka>	sgallagh: Go debug infos are "kind of broken" from regular C/C++ point of view so they might have missed some corner cases
Jul 16 12:52:01 <mhroncok>	tibbs: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#BuildRequires_and_.25.7B_isa.7D can i go and change that example to python3?
Jul 16 12:55:02 <tibbs>	Yeah, or use some other example or even a generic example like 'foo'.
Jul 16 12:56:00 <tibbs>	It's probably best if we avoid using some unrelated real-world example in a section like that since it runs the risk of becoming outdated.
Jul 16 12:57:21 <mhroncok>	Macro forms of system executables SHOULD NOT be used except when there is a need to allow the location of those executables to be configurable. For example, rm should be used in preference to %{__rm}, but %{__python} is acceptable.
Jul 16 12:58:11 <mhroncok>	that is atually ok
Jul 16 12:58:16 <mhroncok>	as __python is configurable :)
Jul 16 12:58:54 <mhroncok>	tibbs: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Scripting_inside_of_spec_files what about here?
Jul 16 13:30:38 <tibbs>	Not sure what you're asking.
Jul 16 13:30:47 <tibbs>	Python is still the name of a programming language, isn't it?
Jul 16 13:31:18 <tibbs>	I would think that changing that list would require a vote.
Jul 16 13:31:24 <mhroncok>	tibbs: yes, last sentence
Jul 16 13:31:36 <mhroncok>	you need to explicitly add a BuildRequires for perl or python.
Jul 16 13:31:44 <mhroncok>	you are not allowed to BR python
Jul 16 13:31:59 <mhroncok>	now is both python 2 and python 3 allowed?
Jul 16 13:32:21 <mhroncok>	in that case, it hsould say: you need to explicitly add a BuildRequires for perl, python2 or python3.
Jul 16 13:32:49 <mhroncok>	...or we say only Python 3 is allowed, and be done with iot
Jul 16 13:32:59 <mhroncok>	but that probably requires a vote
Jul 16 13:33:01 <mhroncok>	as said
Jul 16 13:33:02 <tibbs>	I would make the sentence generic.  If you all a language interpreter in your specfile, you MUST have a dependency on that interpreter.
Jul 16 13:33:23 <mhroncok>	or that
Jul 16 13:34:11 <tibbs>	Currently I would think that if anyone was calling /usr/bin/python directly in a specfile then those packages would have failed the rebuild.
Jul 16 13:34:31 <mhroncok>	should have
Jul 16 13:34:33 <tibbs>	But it certainly wouldn't hurt to clean up the guidelines.
Jul 16 13:36:42 <thm>	can someone give me a hint what to do with an error from itstool like this: Error: Could not merge translations: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 190: ordinal not in range(128)
Jul 16 13:39:56 <smooge>	clippy: it looks like you are trying to import a non-ascii character set into python2
Jul 16 13:40:42 <thm>	well, I suspect itstool is trying to output something non-ascii to a pipe, which is non-UTF
Jul 16 13:40:48 <thm>	but why, and what?
Jul 16 13:41:11 <mhroncok>	thm: does export LANG=C.utf-8 help?
Jul 16 13:41:20 <thm>	will try
Jul 16 13:51:05 <thm>	mhroncok: doesn't seem so. itstool is trying to print an error, quoting a missing translation, where the C string contains a unicode char. now, in mock, the output is not a terminal, but a pipe, so Python sets the output encoding to ascii.
Jul 16 13:51:43 <thm>	maybe I shoud set PYTHONIOENCODING
Jul 16 13:51:50 <mhroncok>	maybe
Jul 16 13:52:17 <mhroncok>	I remember that issues liek this should have been fixed in 3.7
Jul 16 13:52:35 <thm>	not sure if itstool is using python 3
Jul 16 13:52:53 <mhroncok>	well, that's part of the problem :(
Jul 16 13:55:20 <thm>	no, it isn't
Jul 16 13:56:45 <thm>	(it is not using py3, I meant)
Jul 16 13:57:54 <mhroncok>	https://github.com/itstool/itstool/pull/3
Jul 16 14:01:09 <tibbs>	Hmm, rpm2cpio seems to have broken at some point.
Jul 16 14:04:17 <tibbs>	No, it still works but somehow the script I have that calls it has stopped working.
Jul 16 14:07:09 <RaphGro>	python3-jep.armv7hl: E: script-without-shebang /usr/share/licenses/python3-jep/LICENSE
Jul 16 14:07:24 <RaphGro>	why is %license not able to fix that automagically?
Jul 16 14:07:26 <tibbs>	Why would the license file be executable?
Jul 16 14:08:00 <tibbs>	I think %license just copies; I don't think it explicitly removes executable permission.
Jul 16 14:08:07 <RaphGro>	I'm fed up with fixing tarball extracts
Jul 16 14:10:19 <RaphGro>	well, anything copied to %{_bindir} gets executable permission
Jul 16 14:10:37 <tibbs>	No, it doesn't.
Jul 16 14:11:35 <RaphGro>	wo why does upstream mark LiCENSE as executable …
Jul 16 14:12:58 <mhroncok>	RaphGro: by mistake I'd say
Jul 16 14:13:28 <RaphGro>	mhroncok: me too. how can this happen with github?
Jul 16 14:13:49 <mhroncok>	RaphGro: github (git actually) tracks file permissions
Jul 16 14:14:05 <mhroncok>	RaphGro: if you git add executable file, it is tracked as executable
Jul 16 14:14:13 <mhroncok>	thm: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/itstool/pull-request/3
Jul 16 14:14:22 <RaphGro>	interesting.
Jul 16 14:34:52 <tibbs>	Wow, somehow dnf uninstalled the running kernel on this machine.
Jul 16 14:34:58 <tibbs>	I thought it wasn't supposed to do that.
Jul 16 14:35:36 <tibbs>	Was having a problem with graphics corruption in 4.17.3, booted back to 4.16.16 which is fine, but now after an update 4.16.16 was uninstalled.
Jul 16 14:37:36 <tibbs>	Oh, hmm, just the metapackage is gone.  kernel-core and kernel-modules for that version are still around.  Still weird.
Jul 16 14:42:18 <mhroncok>	kernelless is the new serverless
Jul 16 14:51:13 <robatino>	tibbs: my experience has been that dnf will uninstall the version of kernel-devel corresponding to the running kernel, but has always left the others alone
Jul 16 14:51:52 <robatino>	so to keep them synced, i have to remove the correct version of kernel-devel manually
Jul 16 14:51:52 <tibbs>	The same for kernel-headers.  There's generally only one of those.
Jul 16 14:52:19 <tibbs>	In any case, I just bumped the installonly_limit to keep the old kernel around for a bit.
Jul 16 14:53:10 <robatino>	when i hit it, it's because i'm running the oldest installed kernel in rawhide (because that one is non-debug), so haven't seen the kernel-headers issue
Jul 16 14:54:13 <tibbs>	I think there's a repository for non-debug rawhide kernels if you want to have something newer.
Jul 16 14:54:32 <tibbs>	dnf config-manager --add-repo=http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/rawhide-kernel-nodebug/fedora-rawhide-kernel-nodebug.repo
Jul 16 14:55:16 <robatino>	i always install the new kernels, but normally only run the non-debug ones
Jul 16 14:55:17 <tibbs>	They aren't signed, though, so no secure boot.
Jul 16 14:56:25 <robatino>	you mean that repo has non-debug versions of every rawhide kernel?
Jul 16 14:56:53 <tibbs>	Only the latest one at any particular time.
Jul 16 14:56:56 <tibbs>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RawhideKernelNodebug
Jul 16 14:57:18 <tibbs>	You could perhaps ask them to not delete them; I don't think space on alt is that restrictive.
Jul 16 16:03:28 <smooge>	alt isn't any separate space from archive and other thigns
Jul 16 16:18:25 <gnat42>	hello, I seem to have a build failure for the lack of gcc but I'm not sure why
Jul 16 16:18:30 <gnat42>	https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/9257/28169257/build.log
Jul 16 16:18:36 <gnat42>	cc: Command not found
Jul 16 16:18:40 <gnat42>	however the spec has
Jul 16 16:18:46 <gnat42>	BuildRequires:  systemd gcc gcc-c++
Jul 16 16:19:04 <gnat42>	what am I missing?
Jul 16 16:19:55 <ignatenkobrain>	https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/9257/28169257/root.log
Jul 16 16:20:01 <ignatenkobrain>	there is no gcc in buildroot
Jul 16 16:20:22 <gnat42>	ignatenkobrain: but I have the BuildRequires?
Jul 16 16:21:00 <ignatenkobrain>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/beanstalkd/blob/0afa11e1b167a12d3c123700ea8e9072abc53954/f/beanstalkd.spec
Jul 16 16:21:04 <ignatenkobrain>	gnat42: you don't  :)
Jul 16 16:22:00 <gnat42>	ah hell, wrong branch
Jul 16 16:24:28 <gnat42>	ok so if I add and rebuild its done right? the mass rebuild isn't done in a side tag or anything like that right?
Jul 16 16:27:45 <ignatenkobrain>	gnat42: it's done in side tag, but it doesn't matter
Jul 16 16:28:03 <gnat42>	ok
Jul 16 18:30:33 <tibbs>	So now let's see how many packages added the %defattr back after I removed it....
Jul 16 18:30:46 <tibbs>	Looks like 37.
Jul 16 18:32:29 <tibbs>	Maybe I just missed them somehow, though.
Jul 16 18:34:55 <nirik>	mrunge: you happen to be around? you're listed as the maintainer for python-pbr in epel7. It's version 1.10.0. Is there any chance to update it to 2.0.0 or more ? can file a bug if you like...
Jul 16 18:35:40 <tibbs>	So it appears that one maintainer in particular decided to re-add the needless %defattr back to all of their packages, with an empty commit message.
Jul 16 18:35:44 <tibbs>	Nice.
Jul 16 18:35:57 <rsc>	tibbs: on the other hand it also does not hurt.
Jul 16 18:36:18 <tibbs>	Yes, it does hurt.
Jul 16 18:36:31 <rsc>	Nope, except for you?
Jul 16 18:36:39 <tibbs>	I wish people would stop claiming that having inexplicable cruft in specfiles has no negative effect.
Jul 16 18:37:59 <tibbs>	I've spent a lot of time trying to get new people into packaging.  It's difficult having to explain to them that there are things which have no use but which some people insist on having for reasons which can't be explained.
Jul 16 18:42:13 <tibbs>	If someone doesn't care enough to remove the crap from packages they maintain, that's fine, because I did it for them.
Jul 16 18:43:01 <tibbs>	To add it back is just bizarre, though.
Jul 16 18:44:17 <tmz>	It's also a little surprising that we allow empty commit messages.
Jul 16 18:44:40 <tibbs>	Still, I think there were a few packages I couldn't fix because either the ACLs are broken or because even provenpackagers can't commit.
Jul 16 18:44:58 <nirik>	It sounds like the didn't understand what was going on?
Jul 16 18:45:21 <tibbs>	It's possible.
Jul 16 18:46:21 <nirik>	might try a polite email to them? or if you like I can try...
Jul 16 18:48:32 <tibbs>	So it looks like I couldn't push to fedora-release, fedora-repos or thunderbird.
Jul 16 18:48:54 <rsc>	Thunderbird is due to Trademark stuff, I would guess
Jul 16 18:48:55 <tibbs>	Looking at the gitolite conf, that's intentional.
Jul 16 18:51:09 <tibbs>	Looks like at least eject, fuseiso, inetvis and pards simply have no acls at all in the gitolite config.
Jul 16 18:51:23 <tibbs>	Maybe they're blocked but not marked as dead package or something.
Jul 16 18:52:00 <tibbs>	That does look to be the case.  Interesting.
Jul 16 18:52:03 <nirik>	I can fix those
Jul 16 18:52:14 <nirik>	fedora-release has 'sign off required' set on it.
Jul 16 18:52:24 *	nirik hit that the other day and was confused for a while. 
Jul 16 18:52:34 <tibbs>	You can enforce that on a dist-git repo?  Seems rather odd.
Jul 16 18:53:04 <nirik>	yeah, you can apparently.
Jul 16 18:53:25 <tibbs>	Not sure if that would be considered a bug or not.
Jul 16 18:55:04 <tibbs>	Ah, one of the reversions does have a commit message.  "revert the previous change"
Jul 16 18:57:57 <nirik>	eject, fuseiso, inetvis and pards should now have regened acls
Jul 16 18:57:59 <tibbs>	And one had a commit message of "compiler", presumably because it added a gcc dependency.
Jul 16 18:59:59 <tibbs>	Looks like wacomexpresskeys and webattery also have no ACLs.
Jul 16 19:00:27 <tibbs>	But all of those packages with no ACLs are also blocked in koji.
Jul 16 19:01:08 <nirik>	ah, so likely it just didn't bother with acls for them.
Jul 16 19:01:18 <tibbs>	Yeah, though they should still be retired.
Jul 16 19:01:37 <tibbs>	Well, at least marked dead.package so nobody else runs into them.
Jul 16 19:02:22 <tibbs>	All have been blocked since about F21.
Jul 16 19:04:33 <nirik>	ok, I can tell it to gen acls on them then.
Jul 16 19:06:24 <tibbs>	I was able to retire all of them.
Jul 16 19:08:17 <nirik>	ok, done
Jul 16 19:08:21 <nirik>	cool
Jul 16 19:09:06 <tibbs>	So that's three packages I can't push to (fedora-release, fedora-repos and thunderbird), 27 packages where the change was summarily reverted, and one package which looks like the change got lost in a merge commit.
Jul 16 19:09:34 <tibbs>	Still, I'm up by something like 2650 packages so I'm OK with it.
Jul 16 19:24:25 <Rathann>	tibbs++
Jul 16 19:24:44 <Rathann>	tibbs: big kudos for doing these clean-ups
Jul 16 19:26:21 <tibbs>	Thanks.  Just another in a big line of them.
Jul 16 19:26:48 <Rathann>	I'm considering dropping two binaries from psad package to make it noarch
Jul 16 19:27:07 <Rathann>	one is long obsolete (at least on any modern Linux with a syslog daemon)
Jul 16 19:27:43 <Rathann>	and the other can easily be replaced with systemd service unit Restart= feature
Jul 16 19:27:56 <tibbs>	Well the package description says it contains only three things, so I guess that wouldn't leave it with much.
Jul 16 19:28:18 <Rathann>	hehe
Jul 16 19:28:29 <Rathann>	the description would be updated, of course
Jul 17 00:58:58 <mrunge>	nirik: you don't need to file a bug, iirc, there is already a bug I chose to ignore.
Jul 17 00:59:06 <mrunge>	nirik: will take a look
Jul 17 05:01:30 <bowlofeggs>	bodhi 3.9.0b0 is deployed to staging https://bodhi.stg.fedoraproject.org/docs/user/release_notes.html
Jul 17 05:04:45 <pingou>	\ó/
Jul 17 05:48:24 <Caterpillar>	tomhughes: concerning your message         [19:56] <tomhughes> there are umpteen upstream tickets about it with keepassxc                                              which upstream? Gnome? KeepassXC?
Jul 17 05:49:25 <tomhughes>	well https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/1175 was the one I was subscribed to and was trying to find
Jul 17 05:49:44 <tomhughes>	has now been closed a dupe of https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/795 which is only very loosely true
Jul 17 05:50:00 <tomhughes>	but there are a variety of others in the github tracker
Jul 17 07:14:33 <Caterpillar>	tomhughes: thank you
Jul 17 07:28:31 <ingvarha>	So, what do I do about this? https://taskotron.fedoraproject.org/artifacts/all/e61f4266-8681-11e8-8450-525400fc9f92/tests.yml/ebtree-6.0.8-10.fc29.log
Jul 17 07:29:51 <ingvarha>	and similar
Jul 17 07:29:52 <ingvarha>	https://taskotron.fedoraproject.org/artifacts/all/c281a958-877a-11e8-8450-525400fc9f92/tests.yml/jemalloc-5.1.0-2.fc29.log
Jul 17 07:35:34 <ignatenkobrain>	ingvarha: nothing ;)
Jul 17 07:40:49 <ingvarha>	ignatenkobrain: OK, easy :-)
Jul 17 07:55:50 <jcajka>	sgallagh: hello, have you been able to resolve yesterday issue?
Jul 17 07:56:37 <sgallagh>	No, not yet. Looks like it may be a golang problem. 1.11beta seems not to be producing DWARF output
Jul 17 08:18:40 <ingvarha>	rpm thing: I've never used a %bcond before; is it like a global boolean constant, or does it look for external or internal conditionals somewhere?
Jul 17 08:18:43 <ingvarha>	like
Jul 17 08:18:54 <ingvarha>	%bcond with_python3
Jul 17 08:18:59 <ingvarha>	%bcond without_pyhon2
Jul 17 08:19:15 <ingvarha>	%bcond without_python2
Jul 17 08:19:25 <ingvarha>	and then
Jul 17 08:20:30 <ingvarha>	does that mean that %{with python3} is true for the rest of the specfile, and that %{with python2} is false?
Jul 17 08:27:08 <tomhughes>	well the point is that it both sets a default value and enables the user of --with etc to rpmbuild to change that default
Jul 17 08:28:05 <tomhughes>	so %bcond_with creates a condition that will be false unless enabled on the command line
Jul 17 08:28:17 <tomhughes>	and %bcond_without creates one that will be true unless disabled
Jul 17 08:28:36 <ingvarha>	okay
Jul 17 08:31:49 <ingvarha>	tomhughes: So fo my example above, to force a with-python3 build I would need to do something like  rpmbuild -bp --with python3 --without python2 foo.spec
Jul 17 08:32:51 <ingvarha>	How do that translate to mock or even fedpkg build ?
Jul 17 08:33:00 <ingvarha>	*does
Jul 17 08:34:04 <tomhughes>	fedpkg local and fedpkg mockbuild both accept --with and --without
Jul 17 08:34:25 <tomhughes>	as does mock
Jul 17 08:35:46 <ingvarha>	excellent
Jul 17 08:35:53 <ingvarha>	ah, --with=cheese, yeah
Jul 17 08:36:51 <ingvarha>	tomhughes: And finally, if I want this on the builders? Do I have to change the default?
Jul 17 08:37:18 <tomhughes>	yes
Jul 17 08:48:40 <eclipseo>	sgallagh: jcajka: The problem seems to be caused by the compressing of debug info: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11799 Disabling the compression with -ldflags=-compressdwarf=false seems to solve the issue.
Jul 17 08:49:24 <sgallagh>	eclipseo: Hey, thanks for the tip!
Jul 17 08:53:26 <Son_Goku>	jdieter, submitted new release of zchunk for openSUSE: https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/623443
Jul 17 08:56:01 <jdieter>	Son_Goku: Nice!  I still need to wait until the week of testing has passed before pushing 0.7.6 to stable in F28, F27 and EPEL.
Jul 17 08:56:23 <sgallagh>	eclipseo, jcajka: Should we modify the %gobuild macro to include that by default?
Jul 17 08:56:41 <jcajka>	eclipseo: nice catch :), I haven't  yet looked at it more in depth, still investigating weird issue with pprof, Go and binutils
Jul 17 08:56:47 <Son_Goku>	and I just submitted zchunk to Mageia, too: https://pkgsubmit.mageia.org/
Jul 17 08:57:38 <ignatenkobrain>	jcajka: it sounds like a bug in elfutils or such if dwarf is there and compressed
Jul 17 08:57:53 <ignatenkobrain>	Isn't it?
Jul 17 08:58:00 <jcajka>	sgallaghpossibly
Jul 17 08:58:10 <jcajka>	sgallagh: possibly I will look at it tomorrow
Jul 17 08:58:13 <sgallagh>	Thanks
Jul 17 08:58:48 <jcajka>	ignatenkobrain: maybe not,  if Go is compressing them on it is own
Jul 17 08:59:01 <jcajka>	s/it is/its
Jul 17 08:59:55 <ignatenkobrain>	jcajka: in any case, talk to mjw
Jul 17 09:01:50 <jcajka>	ignatenkobrain: already talking :), he asked me if it is the case to open bug/RFE against rpm/debugedit
Jul 17 09:02:12 <sgallagh>	Ah, I just started a conversation about it in #rpm.org as well :-/
Jul 17 09:08:02 <sgallagh>	jcajka: Could you send a message to devel-announce informing people about the `-ldflags=-compressdwarf=false` option? I'm sure others are going to hit this if they haven't already.
Jul 17 09:09:32 <ignatenkobrain>	sgallagh: I think we should rather add that to gobuild than asking all people to add that manually
Jul 17 09:10:00 <sgallagh>	ignatenkobrain: Except that it only works if you can use %gobuild
Jul 17 09:10:12 <sgallagh>	My package, hub, for example can't
Jul 17 09:10:22 <jcajka>	sgallagh: hm.. I'm not sure that announce is right, but as zebob.m brought it up at fedora-devel i will respond there
Jul 17 09:10:25 <sgallagh>	Because it calls `go build` inside another buildsystem
Jul 17 09:10:47 <jcajka>	ignatenkobrain, sgallagh: yes I will add it to the macros, but it will not help in all cases
Jul 17 09:10:52 <ignatenkobrain>	sgallagh: oh God
Jul 17 09:11:21 <sgallagh>	ignatenkobrain: I didn't write it, I just have to maintain it -_-
Jul 17 09:22:35 <jcajka>	sgallagh: just sent it to the devel and golang MLs
Jul 17 09:22:44 <sgallagh>	jcajka: Thanks!
Jul 17 09:22:56 <jcajka>	np, I have... :)
Jul 17 09:23:28 <sgallagh>	jcajka: FYI, we have to be careful how we implement %gobuild, since I just confirmed that it errors out if that flag is passed to Go 1.10 or earlier :-(
Jul 17 09:24:30 <jcajka>	sgallagh: ok, thanks for info, I have been planing only on adding it for the rawhide/f29
Jul 17 09:25:19 *	sgallagh nods
Jul 17 09:29:30 <sgallagh>	jcajka: Hmm, actually I don't know if the prerelease of golang we have right now even has that ldflags option.
Jul 17 09:29:37 <sgallagh>	Using it is failing on Rawhide :-(
Jul 17 09:29:53 <sgallagh>	Is our current snapshot older than the fix?
Jul 17 09:30:24 <Raybih>	, nontrinitarian denominations comprise a minority of modern Christianity.
Jul 17 09:30:44 <sgallagh>	Oh wait
Jul 17 09:31:03 <sgallagh>	It's in the help output... maybe I have a copy-paste bug.
Jul 17 09:31:39 <sgallagh>	Yep, that was it.
Jul 17 09:31:42 *	sgallagh facepalms
Jul 17 10:02:47 <d9k>	do this, https://ptpb.pw/cfi_/diff, then use GO_DWARFCOMP=false
Jul 17 10:35:07 <tomhughes>	which sort of dwarf compression is that doing?
Jul 17 10:37:21 <d9k>	https://tip.golang.org/src/cmd/link/internal/ld/data.go#L2166
Jul 17 10:40:34 <tomhughes>	that's only half an answer, though enough of one to know we probably don't want it anyway ;-)
Jul 17 10:40:57 <tomhughes>	there are about three ways of doing it you see...
Jul 17 10:42:36 <tomhughes>	there's a non-standard gnu thing of zlibing it and adding a z to the start of the section name
Jul 17 10:42:47 <d9k>	https://tip.golang.org/src/cmd/link/internal/ld/dwarf.go#L1947
Jul 17 10:42:56 <tomhughes>	a standardised version of that which adds a flag to the section instead of chaning the name
Jul 17 10:43:03 <tomhughes>	and then there is dwz which is what fedora normally does
Jul 17 10:43:44 <tomhughes>	ok that's doing .zdebug which is the oldest and least standard
Jul 17 10:44:09 <tomhughes>	but zlibbing it is kind of horrid anyway as it means anything wantint to use it has to read it all in and decompress it
Jul 17 10:44:36 <tomhughes>	and the fedora setup will use dwz anyway
Jul 17 11:25:24 <amoralej>	mhroncok, i've closed https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1597588 https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1128114 is f29-pending
Jul 17 11:25:27 <amoralej>	is that ok?
Jul 17 11:26:12 <mhroncok>	amoralej++
Jul 17 11:26:15 <mhroncok>	it's ok
Jul 17 11:26:24 <amoralej>	one less issue for f29 :)
Jul 17 11:26:29 <amoralej>	sorry for the delay
Jul 17 11:26:36 <mhroncok>	amoralej: except the version-release metadata is wrong
Jul 17 11:26:47 <amoralej>	mhroncok, which one?
Jul 17 11:26:56 <mhroncok>	7.0.0~a1-1
Jul 17 11:27:19 <mhroncok>	but at least 7.0.0~a1-1 < 7.0.0-1
Jul 17 11:27:22 <amoralej>	that's not pre-release recommended?
Jul 17 11:27:43 <mhroncok>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Versioning#Prerelease_versions
Jul 17 11:27:46 <amoralej>	mhroncok, that was my understanding from https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingDrafts/TildeVersioning#Pre-Release_Packages
Jul 17 11:28:16 <mhroncok>	that is a draft, but probably ok
Jul 17 11:28:18 <mhroncok>	tibbs: ?
Jul 17 11:28:19 <mhroncok>	^
Jul 17 11:28:29 <amoralej>	ohhh
Jul 17 11:28:41 <amoralej>	in fact, i was about to create 7.0.0-0.1 as i've done in the past
Jul 17 11:28:44 <amoralej>	but i found that doc
Jul 17 11:28:53 <tibbs>	Tilde versioning is not at all permitted in Fedora.
Jul 17 11:28:57 <amoralej>	i din't realized is a draft
Jul 17 11:29:07 <amoralej>	ok, i'll rebuild it with 7.0.0-0.1
Jul 17 11:29:09 <tibbs>	That draft was just a draft in case we wanted to go that way.
Jul 17 11:29:50 <tibbs>	I'm mildly in support of it but don't care enough to try and push it forward.
Jul 17 11:30:20 <tibbs>	In any case, I don't think I can make the "This page is a draft only" thing at the top be much more prominent.
Jul 17 11:30:41 <tibbs>	I could cut and paste that at random places in the document, I guess.
Jul 17 11:30:58 <amoralej>	yeah, i didn't pay attention into it and search for prerelease section directly
Jul 17 11:31:04 <mhroncok>	http://wiki.cfcl.com/pub/Help/WebGraphics/draft.jpg background :)
Jul 17 11:31:23 <amoralej>	yes, a draft backround may be good
Jul 17 11:31:23 <tibbs>	I wonder how that examples section got mangled so badly, though.
Jul 17 11:31:51 <tibbs>	I do not know if I can set the background for a wiki page like that.
Jul 17 11:32:17 <mhroncok>	maybe we can make it so that if it has PackagingDrafts in tittle, it get's automagically set :)
Jul 17 11:32:29 <tibbs>	Not that I care much anyway; that draft is not far from being two years old and there's just not that much interest in switching everything.
Jul 17 11:33:19 <amoralej>	mhroncok, i've untagged https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1128114 , i'll create a new one
Jul 17 11:35:47 <mhroncok>	amoralej: thanks
Jul 17 11:50:39 <Pharaoh_Atem>	tibbs: I mean, I'm just tired of fighting
Jul 17 11:50:53 <Pharaoh_Atem>	I want it to be a thing, but it's hard when people straight up hate it because it looks like something Debian does
Jul 17 11:51:10 <Pharaoh_Atem>	even though the scheme was conceptualized based on what openSUSE does :/
Jul 17 11:51:30 <tibbs>	I don't think everyone straight up hates it.  Or that Debian has anything to do with why some people don't like it.
Jul 17 11:51:57 <PavelB>	IDK, I don't like a lot of things about Debian
Jul 17 11:52:05 <tibbs>	The primary issue seems to be that it offers no additional functionality, and has some negatives.
Jul 17 11:53:30 <tibbs>	Not to say that it doesn't have positives.
Jul 17 11:54:00 <tibbs>	But it isn't correct to dismiss criticism as having something to do with Debian or NIH-syndrome or something like that.
Jul 17 11:54:13 <PavelB>	NIH?
Jul 17 11:54:15 <Pharaoh_Atem>	no, but I felt that I addressed the technical criticism pretty well
Jul 17 11:54:23 <tibbs>	"Not Invented Here".
Jul 17 11:54:26 <Pharaoh_Atem>	I kept revising that thing over and over based on technical feedback
Jul 17 11:54:27 <PavelB>	Ah
Jul 17 11:55:37 <Pharaoh_Atem>	I've got plenty of proposals that I'd love to actually do something with, but this one exhausted me
Jul 17 11:55:52 <Pharaoh_Atem>	and I was driving a whole bunch of changes at the same time, so it fell by the wayside
Jul 17 11:56:30 <Pharaoh_Atem>	between rust, rich deps, debuginfo, etc. it just slipped away from me
Jul 17 11:57:24 <tibbs>	Well the composition of the packaging committee has changed, so maybe there's more interest now.  But the committee has plenty of other work going on, too, so it's probably not the right time to bring it back up.
Jul 17 11:57:30 <Pharaoh_Atem>	yeah
Jul 17 11:57:52 <Pharaoh_Atem>	and right now, I'm running a distro-wide experiment in OpenMandriva to get rid of manually specifying the disttag
Jul 17 11:58:57 <Pharaoh_Atem>	we're autosetting the disttag using the %disttag rpm property there: https://github.com/OpenMandrivaSoftware/rpm-openmandriva-setup/blob/master/user/openmandriva/macros#L26
Jul 17 11:59:23 <Pharaoh_Atem>	and then making it so that the file name has the disttag in it: https://github.com/OpenMandrivaSoftware/rpm-openmandriva-setup/blob/master/user/openmandriva/macros#L30
Jul 17 11:59:53 <Pharaoh_Atem>	disttag is included as an rpm header field instead of in the release field
Jul 17 12:16:17 <tibbs>	It's an interesting way to do it.
Jul 17 12:17:19 <tibbs>	But is %dist still defined there?  If not, then you'd have to make sure no packages use it in random conditionals elsewhere in the spec.
Jul 17 12:18:13 <tibbs>	And if so, then you'd have to make sure that it doesn't appear in Release:.  Which would imply a loss of specfile compatibility across distro versions, which while fine with me would unleash a flamewar I wouldn't want to fight.
Jul 17 12:19:23 <tibbs>	I wonder if other distros have the same opposition to making big specfile changes that Fedora seems to have.
Jul 17 12:26:54 <misc>	tibbs: quite likely, yes
Jul 17 12:47:45 <tibbs>	I doubt it given the ease with which they seem to adopt change at that level.
Jul 17 13:02:13 <tibbs>	Hmm, interesting dnf backtrace in rawhide just now.
Jul 17 13:02:19 <tibbs>	RuntimeError: C++ std::exception: TransactionItem state is not set: grub2-tools-1:2.02-37.fc29.x86_64
Jul 17 13:04:01 <tibbs>	And there are a whole bunch of backtraces previous to that in the same run.
Jul 17 13:04:16 <tibbs>	RuntimeError: TransactionItem not found for key: grub2-tools-efi
Jul 17 13:04:38 <tibbs>	A bunch for grub2-tools-efi, and a bunch for grub2-tools-extra as well.
Jul 17 13:05:58 <ignatenkobrain>	Enjoy your c++
Jul 17 13:06:02 <tibbs>	dnf check and rpm -Va are OK, though, so I guess the system is OK.
Jul 17 13:08:06 <tibbs>	dnf was updating itself, but I hope that wasn't the cause of the issue.
Jul 17 13:08:19 <tibbs>	I guess I'll see if it reoccurs the next time rawhide composes.
Jul 17 13:39:41 <RaphGro>	ignatenkobrain: a bunch of my packages FTBFS because of missing BuildRequires: gcc-c++, can you fix that?
Jul 17 13:40:28 <ignatenkobrain>	RaphGro: give me examples so that I can construct regex
Jul 17 13:40:54 <RaphGro>	ignatenkobrain: will prepare a list by looking through koschei
Jul 17 13:42:13 <ignatenkobrain>	RaphGro: feel free to send me list over email
Jul 17 13:53:44 <RaphGro>	lupinix: did you look into FTBFS of lxmenu-data? it is noarch but configure wants to find gcc, lol.
Jul 17 13:54:31 <lupinix>	no, but adding a BR on gcc should be enough then
Jul 17 13:55:09 <RaphGro>	it's there …
Jul 17 13:56:22 <RaphGro>	so maybe gcc-c++ is needed, haha.
Jul 17 13:57:38 <RaphGro>	hmm, last build of kosche is from 2018-07-11
Jul 17 13:57:43 <RaphGro>	koschei *
Jul 17 14:12:46 <ignatenkobrain>	RaphGro: just send me links over email
Jul 17 14:16:55 <RaphGro>	ignatenkobrain: e-mail sent. for some of those packages I'm not sure if we need gcc-c++ because of too less information in build.log
Jul 17 14:17:20 <RaphGro>	or last koschei build is too old to guess
Jul 17 14:17:45 <yaneti>	https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/f29-failures.html
Jul 17 14:18:08 <RaphGro>	yaneti: there are several issues in rawhide actually to lead to FTBFS
Jul 17 14:20:31 <RaphGro>	yaneti: several pages counted → https://apps.fedoraproject.org/koschei/?order_by=state-f29%2Crunning%2Cfailing%2Cname
Jul 17 14:23:05 <yaneti>	well, 6of6 I had there at some point were gcc br related.. I'd wager at least a third for the while list :)
Jul 17 14:32:29 <RaphGro>	yaneti: sirikali is wrongly listed in the mass-rebuild link because koschei tells me success
Jul 17 14:33:29 <RaphGro>	TBH I don't understand why we need another FTBFS list if the packages are in koschei for scratch-builds
Jul 17 14:33:38 <Pharaoh_Atem>	tibbs: actually, big spec file changes is increasingly normal in other distros
Jul 17 14:34:05 <Pharaoh_Atem>	tibbs: openSUSE enforces it using spec-cleaner and post-build checks that can fail the build
Jul 17 14:34:14 <Pharaoh_Atem>	https://github.com/openSUSE/spec-cleaner
Jul 17 14:34:41 <Pharaoh_Atem>	in Mageia, big changes to all the spec files isn't difficult to do, especially en masse because the Dist-SVN setup makes it easy to do so
Jul 17 14:35:20 <Pharaoh_Atem>	and there have been times where that's been done, like forcing everything over to pkgconfig() deps, switching over to using pythonXdist() names for Python modules, and so on
Jul 17 14:35:43 <Pharaoh_Atem>	we're actually going to do a big change where we get rid of %configure2_5x and make %configure work like it does in other distros
Jul 17 14:36:04 <Pharaoh_Atem>	these days, Fedora is the frustrating outlier in simplifying and aggressively improving packaging
Jul 17 14:36:17 <yaneti>	RaphGro: ermm.. https://apps.fedoraproject.org/koschei/package/sirikali  that last one was in february ?
Jul 17 14:36:41 <RaphGro>	yaneti: yeah, I forgot to add sirikali to koschei, no idea why
Jul 17 14:36:55 <yaneti>	compared to the mass rebuild one which was two days ago.. https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=26333
Jul 17 14:37:10 <RaphGro>	anyways, I don't care about random FTBFS due to a funny scratch build done days ago
Jul 17 14:38:12 <Pharaoh_Atem>	tibbs: %dist is not defined at all
Jul 17 14:38:22 <Pharaoh_Atem>	in the OpenMandriva experiment
Jul 17 14:38:38 <Pharaoh_Atem>	and %mkrel, the macro that Mandriva family uses, does not emit a disttag in OpenMandriva
Jul 17 14:38:49 <Pharaoh_Atem>	so there's no "conventional" way to emit it twice
Jul 17 14:46:38 <RaphGro>	.whoowns libattr
Jul 17 14:46:38 <zodbot>	RaphGro: No such package exists.
Jul 17 14:46:56 <RaphGro>	Packages affected by libattr-devel upgrade from 2.4.47-23.fc28 to 2.4.48-1.fc28 (in Fedora 28)
Jul 17 14:47:02 <RaphGro>	https://apps.fedoraproject.org/koschei/affected-by/libattr-devel?epoch1=0&version1=2.4.47&release1=23.fc28&epoch2=0&version2=2.4.48&release2=1.fc28&collection=f28
Jul 17 14:53:15 <mkb>	so I got an email complaining that my package's abi changed
Jul 17 14:53:22 <mkb>	https://taskotron.fedoraproject.org/artifacts/all/621d7ece-881b-11e8-8b63-525400fc9f92/tests.yml/orangefs-2.9.7-4.fc29.log
Jul 17 14:53:27 <mkb>	is there something I am supposed to be doing about this?
Jul 17 14:53:44 <ignatenkobrain>	mkb: that's fine
Jul 17 14:53:48 <RaphGro>	.whoowns attr
Jul 17 14:53:48 <zodbot>	RaphGro: kdudka
Jul 17 14:53:50 <ignatenkobrain>	Ignore it
Jul 17 14:54:11 <RaphGro>	ignore the whole rawhide branch actually, I would suggest ^^
Jul 17 14:54:31 <nirik>	wat? no...
Jul 17 14:54:41 <mkb>	yeah it didn't look particularly important
Jul 17 14:54:53 <nirik>	mkb: do other packages depend on yours?
Jul 17 14:55:04 <mkb>	not afaik and I would be very surprised if so
Jul 17 14:56:38 <nirik>	ok then. If there are any you should coordinate with them on abi changes... if not, then it's not a big deal in rawhide.
Jul 17 14:56:45 <RaphGro>	nirik: sorry but I lost any overview, too many open issues actually. where should I start to fix my packages?
Jul 17 14:57:12 <RaphGro>	koschei reports are just wrong and not useful
Jul 17 14:57:28 <mkb>	thanks everyone
Jul 17 14:58:09 <nirik>	they may be behind due to mass rebuild... you should fix the mass rebuild failures...
Jul 17 14:58:37 <nirik>	you can wait for bugs to be filed or just look at https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/f29-failures.html and start fixing your items.
Jul 17 15:00:07 <kwizart>	does the failure list is expected to be updated ? (with only remaining packages once some are fixed in-between ?)
Jul 17 15:00:30 <RaphGro>	kwizart: ^^
Jul 17 15:00:39 <RaphGro>	that's what I mean with outdated scratch builds
Jul 17 15:02:24 <nirik>	kwizart: it updates every 10min I think? so if you fix something with a new build now it will disappear from the list or should
Jul 17 15:02:34 <yaneti>	it does
Jul 17 15:03:07 <nirik>	nothing there is scratch builds. The mass rebuild does really real official builds.
Jul 17 15:03:07 <nirik>	and you should too to fix the failures
Jul 17 15:04:26 <kwizart>	well, it's not updated in my case or maybe a little. So I expect it's updated on a daily basis (or twice a day maybe)
Jul 17 15:04:32 <nirik>	you can of course do scratch builds to test fixes and see if it builds.
Jul 17 15:04:47 <nirik>	it has the last update at the top?
Jul 17 15:04:51 <nirik>	Last run: 2018-07-17 05:21:32.944879 UTC
Jul 17 15:05:03 <nirik>	so I guess mboddu stopped it now...
Jul 17 15:06:00 <yaneti>	Last run: 2018-07-17 19:01:27.326348 UTC
Jul 17 15:06:21 *	nirik reloads. 
Jul 17 15:06:28 <RaphGro>	nirik: anyways, I would be nice to see those FTBFS somehow integrated into koschei
Jul 17 15:06:35 <nirik>	ha yeah, firefox didn't reload it for me
Jul 17 15:07:29 <mboddu>	nirik: I haven't stopped anything, find_failures is still running
Jul 17 15:07:48 <nirik>	yeah, my page wasn't updating for some reason. ;) reloaded it and yep.
Jul 17 15:12:29 <mboddu>	nirik: But I think I can stop it now, but I will leave it for couple more days
Jul 17 15:12:48 <nirik>	well, I'd leave it updating until you file the bugs, then stop it.
Jul 17 15:17:13 <mboddu>	nirik: Yup, thats the plan :)
Jul 17 15:22:12 <Rathann>	do I need to fix an FTBFS filed when F28 was rawhide if I built a new version in rawhide recently?
Jul 17 15:23:42 <nirik>	not unless the version of the package in f28 needs an update for some reason. If not, I'd just close it saying you fixed it in rawhide
Jul 17 15:27:35 <ignatenkobrain>	ugh, signing is so backlogged
Jul 17 15:27:39 <ignatenkobrain>	I can't build my chains for whole day
Jul 17 15:27:47 <ignatenkobrain>	=(
Jul 17 15:28:25 <ignatenkobrain>	nirik: any hack how to get some of builds to go through signing "faster" ? :)
Jul 17 15:28:32 <nirik>	nope. sorry.
Jul 17 15:28:39 <nirik>	sorry it's taking so long. ;(
Jul 17 15:29:45 <ignatenkobrain>	nirik: what's the avg speed of robosign?
Jul 17 15:29:48 <ignatenkobrain>	10 pkgs / min ?
Jul 17 15:30:07 <nirik>	it's impossible to say it that way, because it depends on the package.
Jul 17 15:30:21 <nirik>	texlive-base takes a long time because it has 5,000 subpackages
Jul 17 15:30:38 <nirik>	0ad-data takes a long time because it's gigantic
Jul 17 15:30:53 <ignatenkobrain>	nirik: but the avg?
Jul 17 15:31:04 <ignatenkobrain>	nirik: let's not account for texlive and webkit ;)
Jul 17 15:31:52 <ignatenkobrain>	oh yeah, maps, pictures and sounds for 0ad is huge
Jul 17 15:32:01 <ignatenkobrain>	but it's really nice game
Jul 17 15:32:04 <ignatenkobrain>	nirik: have you ever tried playing it?
Jul 17 15:32:17 <nirik>	yeah. :) I never got into it, but I did run it a bit once to see what it was like.
Jul 17 15:45:21 <RaphGro>	nothing about FTBFS for sirikali, successfully rebuild without any change
Jul 17 15:47:45 <RaphGro>	ignatenkobrain: at least cpptest and dreamchess-tools should be fixed by adding BR: gcc-c++

Jul 17 16:31:56 <eclipseo>	how much time do we have to fix the mass rebuilds FTFBS?
Jul 17 16:33:24 <nirik>	it's best if they are fixed before branching... after that you have to fix them in two places
Jul 17 16:33:59 <nirik>	2018-08-14 https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/29/Schedule
Jul 17 16:39:37 <eclipseo>	ok thanks
Jul 17 16:43:38 <tibbs>	Looks like we're still signing packages that start with 'm'.  Ouch.
Jul 17 16:49:32 <tibbs>	Did autosigning get turned on at some point for f29-build, or did nothing at all get signed during the rebuild?
Jul 17 16:50:48 <tibbs>	ignatenkobrain: And if you want to see what's being signed and now fast it's happening, run fedmsg-tail --include buildsys.rpm.sign --really-pretty|grep -v WARNING
Jul 17 16:52:45 <tibbs>	Seems like it takes about 10-20 seconds per source package for the average case.  Obviously noarch would go faster, and huge packages with a lot of subpackages will go slower.
Jul 17 17:11:37 <gnat42>	adamw: you around?
Jul 17 17:18:45 <RaphGro>	if I add changes into a spec file due to FTBFS from mass-rebuild, should I increment Release?
Jul 17 17:19:05 <RaphGro>	because there's also needed a new entry in changelog
Jul 17 17:19:23 <gnat42>	RaphGro: yup
Jul 17 17:32:42 <tibbs>	So I have this machine which powers itself back on immediately after the OS powers it down.
Jul 17 17:33:29 <tibbs>	It's not wake-on-lan because this happens even if the network cable is unplugged.
Jul 17 17:35:12 <tibbs>	But if I turn off the BIOS setting that lets wake-on-lan function ("Power Up by PCIe device" or something like that) then it will power down properly.
Jul 17 17:37:57 <tibbs>	Arch documentation to the rescue.  Mentions the exact same motherboard that I have with this issue.  Nice.
Jul 17 17:38:51 <nirik>	sgallagh: you happen to still be around? wanted to ask you a module question or two
Jul 17 17:39:20 <sgallagh>	Somewhat
Jul 17 17:39:30 <sgallagh>	On mobile, waiting for dinner to finish.
Jul 17 17:40:54 <nirik>	ah, it's not urgent. :) basically say you have a group of packages foo and you want to provide some newer ones in a module. Would that be a valid thing? or would you need to have 2 modules with the same packages to switch between. I guess I'm unclear on the module vs non module case...
Jul 17 17:43:09 <adamw>	gnat42: what's up?
Jul 17 17:44:59 <gnat42>	super quick - I tried to respond to the email on the test@ lists but got bounced. Oh it seems it was cross posted to devel. I was just notifying you of the small typo in the wording for 'Release criteria proposal'. I thought should be "must be able to appropriately install" as opposed to must be able appropriately to install"
Jul 17 17:52:58 <RaphGro>	nirik: successfully rebuild nitroshare but it does not disappear from mass-rebuild list
Jul 17 17:53:26 <RaphGro>	nm-tray, the same.
Jul 17 18:01:25 <adamw>	gnat42: you're diving into a gigantic grammatical sinkhole there :P see my mail reply
Jul 17 18:01:43 <gnat42>	so it seems :)
Jul 17 18:03:39 <nirik>	RaphGro: it's because the signing queue is still full of mass rebuild packages and that script checks if they landed in f29 tag yet. Should clear up in the next few days.
Jul 17 18:18:03 <sgallagh>	nirik: you can have a module that overrides non-modular RPMs
Jul 17 18:18:27 <sgallagh>	By policy, we forbid that from being available as the default stream for that module
Jul 17 18:18:53 <RaphGro>	nirik: lxqt-sudo is fixed, too.
Jul 17 18:19:37 <RaphGro>	i don't understand the error with python-jnius, it seems to be a bug with python environment
Jul 17 18:20:19 <sgallagh>	nirik: for example, I have a django:1.6 stream that overrides Django 2.0 for use with older apps

Jul 17 18:21:27 <jaroslav>	Hi, why do we have clojure in such an ancient version? Even in Rawhide I still see a package from fc24. #asking_for_a_friend
Jul 17 18:23:02 <nirik>	sgallagh: ah cool. ok. Thanks.
Jul 17 21:51:20 <tibbs>	jaroslav: I would wager there's not enough maintainer interest in updating clojure.
Jul 17 21:51:58 <tibbs>	It hasn't received any commits other than mass rebuilds since Fedora 24.  And the last person to update it isn't currently listed as a maintainer on the package.
Jul 17 21:52:16 <tibbs>	So... if you want to get involved with it, I'm sure they wouldn't mind having another maintainer.
Jul 18 00:30:44 <QuLogic>	so still no chance of an aarch64 test machine?
Jul 18 01:43:36 <kasong>	hi, is there any sponsor working on anaconda or kexec related packages? I'm seeking sponsor for an package
Jul 18 02:52:49 <QuLogic>	ooh, I totally forgot about the new mock forcearch feature
Jul 18 02:53:09 <QuLogic>	so much easier than trying endless scratch builds
Jul 18 07:12:31 <RaphGro>	ignatenkobrain: please ignore my first e-mail. can you fix the packages listed in my second e-mail?
Jul 18 07:21:56 <ignatenkobrain>	RaphGro: I think I replied to it
Jul 18 07:22:15 <RaphGro>	ignatenkobrain: yes, got it but I am not sure if I understand :)
Jul 18 07:22:51 <RaphGro>	there are no changes visible in pagure so far
Jul 18 07:30:42 <ignatenkobrain>	RaphGro: there are few projects where you have to fix it yourself (because I don't have time to fix them manually) and one project which I fixed along with other 160 packages
Jul 18 07:31:42 *	tomhughes curses koji
Jul 18 07:32:09 <RaphGro>	ignatenkobrain: okay, thanks for offering help
Jul 18 09:28:46 <RaphGro>	hi, I try to apply that patch but it fails beginning with the modification at line 19/25, why? https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius/commit/61592eedb0e5efd9713d66fcbbc2026daa7851de#diff-26d7d43aef8a6a43d8ba5614258e6965
Jul 18 09:32:27 <eclipseo>	why are all the recent builds stuck in the f29-pending tag?
Jul 18 09:33:15 <ignatenkobrain>	eclipseo: the f29-rebuild → f29 merge is happening which means all builds have to be signed
Jul 18 09:33:23 <ignatenkobrain>	and since there are 20k+ builds, it takes few days
Jul 18 09:33:41 <eclipseo>	ok thanks
Jul 18 09:33:46 <sharkcz>	it's <5k to sign
Jul 18 09:35:22 <ignatenkobrain>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/builds?order=-build_id&tagID=3430&inherited=0&latest=1
Jul 18 09:35:24 <ignatenkobrain>	4220 left
Jul 18 09:35:50 <ignatenkobrain>	so I guess tomorrow we should be back to normal speed
Jul 18 09:35:53 <ignatenkobrain>	or even in 5-10 hours ;)
Jul 18 09:38:44 <tomhughes>	well it's only been seven hours since I started trying to fix this mass rebuild breakage so I guess another seven won't hurt ;-)
Jul 18 09:43:23 <ignatenkobrain>	tomhughes: yeah ;)
Jul 18 09:44:24 <redi>	is there a problem with copr?  Error: Failed to synchronize cache for repo 'fedora'

Jul 20 12:37:09 <RaphGro>	how to tell cmake about debug flags needed? it seems to ignore CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
Jul 20 12:38:05 <RaphGro>	https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L55
Jul 20 13:21:06 <rdieter>	RaphGro: add -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo explicitly if you want, but with cpputest that appears to be the default
Jul 20 13:22:04 <rdieter>	RaphGro: Are you implying proper build flags are not being applied?  If so, where and how exactly?
Jul 20 13:22:34 <rdieter>	RaphGro: this option may be getting in the way:  option(CPPUTEST_FLAGS "Use the CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS set by CppUTest" ON)
Jul 20 13:23:27 <rdieter>	RaphGro: if so, try building with -DCPPUTEST_FLAGS=OFF
Jul 20 13:24:17 <RaphGro>	rdieter: thanks, will try
Jul 20 13:24:31 <rdieter>	seems a bit odd they'd knowing override cmake's built-in flags, not the first time an upstream trying to be too smart
Jul 20 13:24:32 <RaphGro>	rpmbuild fails to find any debug info
Jul 20 13:26:19 <rdieter>	https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest/blob/master/cmake/Modules/CppUTestConfigurationOptions.cmake   this file may need patching
Jul 20 13:26:46 <rdieter>	set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} ${CPPUTEST_C_FLAGS}")  , not sure if CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE gets used here or not
Jul 20 13:26:52 <RaphGro>	well, upstream allows (good old) configure/make and more modern cmake/make process
Jul 20 13:27:30 <RaphGro>	there's also an option to explicitly allow g++
Jul 20 13:29:13 <rdieter>	RaphGro: not a fedora package yet?  I don't see any cpputest in koji offhand
Jul 20 13:29:24 <RaphGro>	working on a spec file
Jul 20 13:29:29 <rdieter>	was going to inspect build.log

Jul 20 13:32:01 <bmeneg>	hi folks, quick question, I might have missed something from mailinglist, but I'm getting "/bin/sh: cc: command not found" in one of the packages I maintain on fedora.. from Makefile it uses ${CC}, am I missing something?
Jul 20 13:32:57 <bmeneg>	it was working normally for f28, but failed on f29 mass rebuild and was trying to figure out what happened.. but didn't find nothing different on ccache package (which provides cc) commit log
Jul 20 13:35:34 <rdieter>	bmeneg: add BuildRequires: GCC
Jul 20 13:35:39 <rdieter>	sorry, BuildRequires: gcc
Jul 20 13:36:03 <rdieter>	bmeneg: see https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Remove_GCC_from_BuildRoot
Jul 20 13:37:09 <rdieter>	bmeneg: in short, if your package requires a compiler, you need to add an explicit dependency now.
Jul 20 13:38:26 <bmeneg>	rdieter: hmmm. ok.. completly missed this requirement.
Jul 20 13:38:36 <bmeneg>	rdieter: tyvm! will update && test it
Jul 20 13:40:46 <RaphGro>	rdieter: maybe we should into CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS instead?
Jul 20 13:41:51 <rdieter>	RaphGro: they modify all of C_FLAGS, CXX_FLAGS, LD_FLAGS
Jul 20 13:42:01 <RaphGro>	-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING='%{optflags}' -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING='%{optflags}'
Jul 20 13:42:07 <RaphGro>	doesn't help either
Jul 20 13:42:32 <rdieter>	and you're using %cmake macro ?
Jul 20 13:42:39 <RaphGro>	sure
Jul 20 13:42:56 <rdieter>	wierd, they must be overriding things elsewhere too
Jul 20 13:43:18 <rdieter>	RaphGro: can you verify in build.log what flags are actually being used?
Jul 20 13:43:48 <RaphGro>	well, obviously upstream consists of wind*ze developers
Jul 20 13:44:38 <RaphGro>	well, the build.log gets huge
Jul 20 13:45:39 <rdieter>	all you need is one line of something getting compiled
Jul 20 13:45:41 <RaphGro>	cd /home/builder/rpmbuild/BUILD/cpputest-3.8/b/src/CppUTest && /usr/lib64/ccache/c++  -DCPPUTEST_HAVE_FORK -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I/home/builder/rpmbuild/BUILD/cpputest-3.8/b -I/home/builder/rpmbuild/BUILD/cpputest-3.8/include  -O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Werror=format-security -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -Wp,-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS -fexceptions -fstack-protector-strong -grecord-gcc-switches -specs=/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/redhat-hardened-cc1 -specs=/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/

Jul 20 13:45:49 <RaphGro>	okay, %optflags are there …
Jul 20 13:46:05 <rdieter>	good
Jul 20 13:46:13 <rdieter>	RaphGro: so what's the problem again?
Jul 20 13:46:48 <rdieter>	whatever it is, it's not compiler flags
Jul 20 13:50:24 <RaphGro>	rdieter: Empty %files file /home/builder/rpmbuild/BUILD/cpputest-3.8/debugsourcefiles.list
Jul 20 14:07:55 <tibbs>	Something (besides RPM itself) could be stripping the debug information.
Jul 20 14:09:02 <tibbs>	Tough to say without being able to look at things in greater detail.
Jul 20 14:09:28 <RaphGro>	build.log https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/2i2tbECPLu4W3BpXjsPQvg
Jul 20 14:12:12 <tibbs>	That's an interesting log, because the lines starting with '+ ' showing what is being executed are missing.  But that's not really relevant.
Jul 20 14:13:47 <RaphGro>	what?
Jul 20 14:14:01 <tibbs>	That's an interesting log, because the lines starting with '+ ' showing what is being executed are missing.  But that's not really relevant.
Jul 20 14:14:49 <RaphGro>	the question is why debuginfo is missing
Jul 20 14:15:00 <tibbs>	I thought debugsource was missing.
Jul 20 14:15:33 <RaphGro>	oh, you're right. a significant difference
Jul 20 14:15:51 <tibbs>	I am guessing (because the lines are missing from the build log you provided) that you do mkdir b; pushd b at some point.
Jul 20 14:16:03 <RaphGro>	yes
Jul 20 14:16:19 <tibbs>	There's a slim chance that it just can't find the source files corresponding to the object files.
Jul 20 14:16:52 <tibbs>	Just for fun, try not building in a separate directory and see what happens.
Jul 20 14:18:29 <RaphGro>	same error
Jul 20 14:19:49 <tibbs>	It really doesn't help that find-debuginfo.sh has no way to get debugging output and is written in this weird 80s style.
Jul 20 14:20:32 <RaphGro>	I try to build in F28 if of any interest
Jul 20 14:21:18 <tibbs>	As in it uses the test command instead of [[ or even [ and things like that.
Jul 20 14:21:43 <tibbs>	So the only thing that writes to debugsourcefiles.list is one bit of code.
Jul 20 14:22:07 <tibbs>	And it only writes that if /usr/src/debug exists in the buildroot.
Jul 20 14:22:53 <tibbs>	If it does, it does the equivalent of d %buildroot/usr; find src/debug -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 | sed 's,^,/usr/,'
Jul 20 14:23:10 <tibbs>	The result is the contents of debugsourcefiles.list.
Jul 20 14:24:22 <tibbs>	But how it generates what goes into /usr/src/debug is... completely beyond me.
Jul 20 14:25:03 <tibbs>	I note that the output you posted has no "extracting debug info from XXX" lines.
Jul 20 14:25:50 <Caterpillar>	the FTBS stuff is really going wild wt...
Jul 20 14:26:23 <RaphGro>	oh, build.log tells about some .a files
Jul 20 14:26:48 <RaphGro>	wrong linkage then
Jul 20 14:39:47 <rdieter>	RaphGro: unless it's expected to create static libs, in which case -debug should be disabled
Jul 20 14:55:16 <RaphGro>	rdieter: we need .so libraries in Fedora, no?
Jul 20 14:57:19 <tibbs>	Yes, if that is possible.
Jul 20 15:36:42 <PavelB>	My dnf gives a traceback when trying to upgrade or install anything, anyone know what that might be about? https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/YMhpLIPnC6PC6RNbXfxtpA
Jul 20 15:41:06 <PavelB>	It happened after an upgrade, but I can't really revert given that dnf itself refuses to do anything
Jul 20 15:44:01 <tibbs>	Oh man, firefox nightly now blocks autoplay with audio by default and gives you a little popup asking if you want to enable it for each site.  Finally.
Jul 20 16:00:47 <omajid>	hi! what's the best (or official) way to find out who owns a package?
Jul 20 16:03:41 <tibbs>	Well nobody owns packages.
Jul 20 16:03:55 <tibbs>	But you can see the list of maintainers at src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/XXX
Jul 20 16:04:16 <tibbs>	Of course replace XXX with the source package name.
Jul 20 16:05:47 <omajid>	tibbs: ah, under the Contributors section?
Jul 20 16:05:58 <tibbs>	Yes, you can see who has commit access there.
Jul 20 16:06:02 <omajid>	thank you!
Jul 20 16:06:25 <tibbs>	I tend to follow the "Bug URL" link from the package and then follow that to the git repository.
Jul 20 16:06:54 <tibbs>	But somehow that's offline at the moment.

Jul 23 08:42:59 *	Now talking on #fedora-devel
Jul 23 08:42:59 *	Topic for #fedora-devel is: Fedora developers channel | end users: please ask for help in #fedora | Infra status http://status.fedoraproject.org/ | s390x now in primary koji for rawhide
Jul 23 08:42:59 *	Topic for #fedora-devel set by dgilmore (Fri Apr 28 18:02:05 2017)
Jul 23 10:05:30 <bowlofeggs>	nirik, maxamillion, jsmith, jwb, zbyszek, tyll, sgallagh, contyk: reminder: FESCo meeting in about an hour in #fedora-meeting-1
Jul 23 10:05:45 <bowlofeggs>	my apologies for it being late, but i just sent out the agenda - 3 items to discuss this week
Jul 23 10:05:53 <sgallagh>	bowlofeggs: ack, thanks.
Jul 23 10:10:24 <maxamillion>	bowlofeggs: +!
Jul 23 10:10:25 <maxamillion>	+1*
Jul 23 10:28:21 <ignatenkobrain>	tomhughes: https://apps.fedoraproject.org/koschei/package/libnitrokey?collection=f29
Jul 23 10:29:31 <tomhughes>	yeah it's a bit of a mess - upstream have renamed the include directory and pkgconfig file from catch to catch2
Jul 23 10:29:31 *	ignatenkobrain sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/nyyaeNdFeOyXXrgVqStNSxuu >
Jul 23 10:29:44 <tomhughes>	presumably to allow parallel installs of catch 1 and catch 2
Jul 23 10:29:56 <ignatenkobrain>	oh god
Jul 23 10:29:56 <tomhughes>	I just went with the change but maybe we shouldn't?
Jul 23 10:29:57 <ignatenkobrain>	I wonder if upstream can stop breaking stuff
Jul 23 10:32:08 <ignatenkobrain>	tomhughes: probably you could create catch-devel-compat where would live symlinks from catch to catch2?
Jul 23 10:32:09 <ignatenkobrain>	along with a pkg-config one?
Jul 23 10:32:10 <ignatenkobrain>	at least for a while
Jul 23 10:37:58 <ignatenkobrain>	tomhughes: P.S. I'm willing to review a patch if you have one
Jul 23 10:39:14 <tomhughes>	I'm trying (and failing) to figure out how many things use catch2
Jul 23 10:39:45 <tomhughes>	It looks like dnf won't let me query for things that require that because it is no longer provided :-(
Jul 23 10:40:56 <ignatenkobrain>	tomhughes: it should still work
Jul 23 10:41:00 <ignatenkobrain>	but from my packages it's cpptest and libnitrokey
Jul 23 10:41:06 <tomhughes>	dnf repoquery --srpm --alldeps --whatrequires "pkgconfig(catch)"
Jul 23 10:41:09 <tomhughes>	is what I'm trying
Jul 23 10:41:12 <ignatenkobrain>	cppcodec
Jul 23 10:41:13 <tomhughes>	but it finds nothing
Jul 23 10:41:16 <ignatenkobrain>	I meant
Jul 23 10:41:35 <ignatenkobrain>	tomhughes: reason is that you search for binary while this is happening at the source level
Jul 23 10:41:49 <tomhughes>	well that's why --srpm
Jul 23 10:41:55 <tomhughes>	that finds BRs instead of Rs
Jul 23 10:42:03 <tomhughes>	at least it does for --requries
Jul 23 10:42:03 <ignatenkobrain>	⋊> ~/P/f/r/rust-mio-extras on master ◦ sudo dnf -q --repo=rawhide-source repoquery --whatrequires "pkgconfig(catch)"                                                                                       16:41:32
Jul 23 10:42:04 <ignatenkobrain>	cppcodec-0:0.1-2.fc29.src
Jul 23 10:42:05 <ignatenkobrain>	libnitrokey-0:3.4.1-1.fc29.src
Jul 23 10:42:16 <tomhughes>	right so only two things to fix then
Jul 23 10:43:19 <bunny__>	Why does Fedora not package electron?
Jul 23 10:43:30 <ignatenkobrain>	tomhughes: no, --srpm is "show srpm instead of binary rpm", not "query srpms instead of binary rpms"
Jul 23 10:43:32 <ignatenkobrain>	tomhughes: I maintain both :)
Jul 23 10:44:29 <tomhughes>	well it makes it download the source repo data
Jul 23 10:44:46 <tomhughes>	and "dnf repoquery --srpm --requires libnitrokey" prints brs while "dnf repoquery --requires libnitrokey" prints run time requires
Jul 23 10:45:00 <tomhughes>	but it doesn't seem to work backwards for whatrequries
Jul 23 10:46:09 <ignatenkobrain>	tomhughes: yes because it needs mapping binary→source
Jul 23 10:46:19 <ignatenkobrain>	you need to use --repo=rawhide-source --arch=src
Jul 23 10:46:58 <ignatenkobrain>	the question is what
Jul 23 10:47:04 <ignatenkobrain>	whoops, wrong chat
Jul 23 11:47:36 <bowlofeggs>	mhroncok: we are discussing https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/1951 in #fedora-meeting-1 if you'd like to participate
Jul 23 11:52:55 <nb>	anyone that knows any ocaml?
Jul 23 11:53:51 <ignatenkobrain>	nb: rwmjones
Jul 23 12:01:36 <nb>	rwmjones, https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=28544561 do I just replace Stdlib.BytesLabels.lowercase with Bytes.lowercase_ascii?
Jul 23 12:01:49 <nb>	and is that just Bytes.lowercase_ascii or Stdlib.Bytes.lowercase_ascii
Jul 23 12:31:30 <ignatenkobrain>	puiterwijk: is there any problem with signing? https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/builds?start=0&tagID=3430&order=-build_id&inherited=0&latest=1&type=rpm
Jul 23 12:31:42 <ignatenkobrain>	rust-matches is there for a few days
Jul 23 12:58:27 <zbyszek>	ignatenkobrain: do you know which build tagets should be checked?
Jul 23 12:58:30 <zbyszek>	f29-build?
Jul 23 12:58:33 <zbyszek>	f29-rebuild?
Jul 23 13:01:27 <zbyszek>	ignatenkobrain: OK, I'm unleashing the script now ;)
Jul 23 13:02:41 <nirik>	f29-build is the current rawhide/f29 buildroot... f29-rebuild was just the side tag the mass rebuild was done in, it should be inactive now.
Jul 23 13:02:55 <zbyszek>	Ah, OK, thanks for the explanation
Jul 23 13:03:30 <ignatenkobrain>	zbyszek: f29-build
Jul 23 13:27:18 <zbyszek>	it seems fedora packagers are much better at fixing builds then at closing bugs
Jul 23 13:27:31 <nirik>	ha.
Jul 23 13:28:05 <mhroncok>	:)
Jul 23 13:29:59 <zbyszek>	So... koji returns a ConnectionError every 50 queries or so (I call it using subprocess.run()). Does it have some ratelimit, or is this just random and I should repeat until successful?
Jul 23 13:31:05 <ignatenkobrain>	zbyszek: why not to use koji's python api? that can do multiCall
Jul 23 13:31:12 <ignatenkobrain>	so that you don't have to do 1 by 1
Jul 23 13:31:44 <zbyszek>	ignatenkobrain: https://pagure.io/ftbfs/blob/master/f/ftbfs.py
Jul 23 13:31:54 <zbyszek>	if you convert it to the api, you'll be my hero
Jul 23 13:32:07 <zbyszek>	I did it the stupid way ;)
Jul 23 13:32:53 <zbyszek>	I added the README now, so it's all fully documented ;]
Jul 23 14:03:56 <zbyszek>	ignatenkobrain: done now, 597 are still open
Jul 23 14:14:09 <tomhughes>	ignatenkobrain: have you patched the fedora libnitrokey to use a completely different buildsystem?!!?
Jul 23 14:15:34 <ignatenkobrain>	tomhughes: yes, and this work has been merged in upstream ;)
Jul 23 14:16:06 <tomhughes>	argh
Jul 23 14:16:11 <ignatenkobrain>	It builds faster and its syntax is for humans ;)
Jul 23 14:16:13 <tomhughes>	wonderd WTF my patch didn't work
Jul 23 14:16:57 <tomhughes>	and your patches won't apply to the upstream code
Jul 23 14:17:48 <ignatenkobrain>	tomhughes: why? I did git format-patch
Jul 23 14:18:21 <tomhughes>	I created a branch form the 3.4.1 tag and then
Jul 23 14:18:24 <tomhughes>	% git apply *.patch
Jul 23 14:18:24 <tomhughes>	error: patch failed: unittest/test_offline.cc:169
Jul 23 14:18:24 <tomhughes>	error: unittest/test_offline.cc: patch does not apply
Jul 23 14:19:33 <tomhughes>	ah work with git am
Jul 23 14:19:39 <tomhughes>	git patching iss too confusing
Jul 23 14:33:03 <rwmjones>	nb: looking
Jul 23 14:33:50 <rwmjones>	nb: the easiest way to fix this is to add the -unsafe-string option to all calls to ocamlopt
Jul 23 14:34:16 <rwmjones>	& then ask upstream to fix it properly later
Jul 23 14:35:01 <rwmjones>	it's all to do with this change:
Jul 23 14:35:05 <rwmjones>	https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/O6KRALASHFDE233ED7AYYFQMR2PLVXAO/
Jul 23 14:38:21 <nb>	rwmjones, I don't appear to be running ocamlopt
Jul 23 14:38:25 <nb>	unless it's in the makefile
Jul 23 14:38:27 *	nb looks there
Jul 23 14:38:57 <rwmjones>	well, "ocamlfind ocamlopt", "ocamlfind ocamlc", "ocamlc", "ocamlopt", "ocamlopt.opt" and anything similar
Jul 23 14:38:59 <nb>	yeah, it's in the makefile
Jul 23 14:39:08 <rwmjones>	basically whenever you run the compiler you have to add -unsafe-string
Jul 23 14:39:08 <nb>	rwmjones, thank you, I will try that
Jul 23 14:39:48 <rwmjones>	this is only a band-aid, real solution is to ask upstream to fix it properly so it uses the new "bytes" type instead of mutating strings
Jul 23 15:13:57 <philipp64>	other than requiring 'gcc', is there anything else that rawhide now demands in the BuildRequires?
Jul 23 15:15:10 <philipp64>	looking at https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:C_and_C++#BuildRequire, it doesn't seem I need to call out ld, ldd, ar, etc.
Jul 23 15:24:26 <rdieter>	philipp64: gcc or gcc-c++ already depend on linkers, etc... as appropriate
Jul 23 15:37:18 <philipp64>	sorry, it's been a while since I banged a lot on fedpkg (most of the packages I own are stable/mature at this point)… so the neurons dealing with updates have gone into dormancy.  what's a good URL for best practices for testing an update?
Jul 23 15:39:59 <philipp64>	I just made a couple of changes (bumped the dist, the changelong, added gcc as a BuildRequires:) and want to make sure I've covered all of my bases...
Jul 23 15:41:44 <ignatenkobrain>	philipp64: send pull request on src.fedoraproject.org
Jul 23 15:49:23 <walters>	gfs
Jul 23 16:04:22 <Guest16140>	walters: What about gfs?
Jul 23 16:05:23 <ignatenkobrain>	zbyszek: https://gist.github.com/ignatenkobrain/f633ddcbe7f96bc10fe09341b7cf159f
Jul 23 16:08:18 <ignatenkobrain>	mboddu: ^^ you might be interested in something like this ;)
Jul 23 16:09:00 <philipp64>	ignatenkobrain: sorry, I didn't make it clear that I was the maintainer in this case...
Jul 23 16:09:18 <philipp64>	hands in too many distros.
Jul 23 16:09:24 <ignatenkobrain>	philipp64: it's still good practice to send PR before pushing into master
Jul 23 16:09:48 <ignatenkobrain>	because it could build a package and run the tests ;)
Jul 23 16:43:42 <FranciscoD>	ignatenkobrain: looks like nibabel has other issues with py3.7 too. Even after I disable our hacks to get rid of the external bits, the build still fails: https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/8194/28548194/build.log
Jul 23 16:44:07 <FranciscoD>	Hrm, shouldn't the test machine at rawhide-test.fedorainfracloud.org have py 3.7?
Jul 23 16:54:12 <ignatenkobrain>	FranciscoD: do a dnf update ;)
Jul 23 16:54:29 <ignatenkobrain>	FranciscoD: that one test should be probably easy to fix
Jul 23 16:54:30 <ignatenkobrain>	just get the warning and fix it ;)
Jul 23 16:54:32 <ignatenkobrain>	guess some regex warnings or smth like that
Jul 23 16:54:45 <FranciscoD>	probably, yeh. I'll figure it out hopefully and open a PR
Jul 23 16:55:16 <FranciscoD>	I wasn't sure if it's OK to run an update on the test machines. I'll run that now
Jul 23 18:06:35 <ignatenkobrain>	nirik: around?
Jul 23 18:08:11 <nirik>	sure. whats up?
Jul 23 18:12:33 <ignatenkobrain>	nirik: I have a script which closes fixed FTBFS bugs, what would be the best place to send PR to?
Jul 23 18:12:58 <ignatenkobrain>	I think it would be beneficial to cleanup those bugs from time to time
Jul 23 18:13:08 <nirik>	releng perhaps? I would think thats where people would look for it?
Jul 23 18:17:56 <PavelB>	.whoowns nethack
Jul 23 18:17:56 <zodbot>	PavelB: lmacken
Jul 23 18:21:36 <ignatenkobrain>	nirik: https://pagure.io/releng/pull-request/7653
Jul 23 18:27:14 <philipp64>	if a project has been rehomed, and the .tar.gz for that project has changed (for the current version), but not in a significant way, what's required to update the .tar.gz that's checked in?  Do I need to run "fedpkg new-sources" or not?
Jul 23 19:32:10 <philipp64>	what does "FAILED: ActionNotAllowed: tag requires autosign permission" mean?
Jul 23 19:33:34 <tomhughes>	it means you can't change that tag - only an admin can
Jul 23 19:33:50 <tomhughes>	are you trying to untag something that has already reached the rawhide build tree or something?
Jul 23 19:36:14 <philipp64>	I don't think so… the previous build was pwauth-2.3.10-17.fc29 from what I can tell.
Jul 23 19:36:40 <philipp64>	and the .spec file after fetching/pulling showed 18 was the dist.
Jul 23 19:36:58 <nirik>	what command(s) did you run that told you that?
Jul 23 19:37:15 <philipp64>	fedpkg —release f29 build
Jul 23 19:37:39 <philipp64>	I'm the package owner.
Jul 23 19:38:05 <nirik>	don't pass '--release f29'... just do 'fedpkg build' in the master branch checkout.
Jul 23 19:38:33 <philipp64>	I'm running f28, though...
Jul 23 19:38:58 <philipp64>	won't that just make it build for f28?
Jul 23 19:39:24 <tomhughes>	no, it uses the branch to figure out where to build
Jul 23 19:39:26 <nirik>	it looks at what you have checked out
Jul 23 19:41:21 <philipp64>	okay, rerunning with —skip-nvr-check
Jul 23 19:42:34 <nirik>	you shouldn't need that.
Jul 23 19:44:52 <philipp64>	well, there was a previous -18 build...
Jul 23 19:45:27 <philipp64>	but that failed too because of:
Jul 23 19:45:28 <philipp64>	28550663 build (rawhide, /rpms/pwauth.git:85250c05de4179bd0bcb447d1c3eea024ee9ce52): open (buildvm-15.phx2.fedoraproject.org) -> FAILED: GenericError: Build already exists (id=1130006, state=COMPLETE): {'name': 'pwauth', 'task_id': 28550663, 'extra': '{"source": {"original_url": "git+https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pwauth.git#85250c05de4179bd0bcb447d1c3eea024ee9ce52"}}', 'pkg_id': 13840, 'epoch': None, 'source': 'git+https://src

Jul 23 19:45:52 <nirik>	yes, you can't build the same version once it successfully builds.
Jul 23 19:46:12 <philipp64>	but it didn't exactly build successfully… the buildtag failed.
Jul 23 19:46:22 <philipp64>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=28550430
Jul 23 19:46:31 <philipp64>	err..  tagBuild
Jul 23 19:48:33 <nirik>	ah, it's because of your build you did with --release f29... that tried to tag it into the wrong tag and failed to do that, but the build actually worked.
Jul 23 19:48:55 <philipp64>	okay, so what do I do now, if anything?
Jul 23 19:49:26 <nirik>	I might be able to tag it into the right place, give me a sec...
Jul 23 19:50:30 <philipp64>	thanks!
Jul 23 19:50:46 <nirik>	it still looks weird. might just bump it to -19 and do another build...
Jul 23 19:52:45 <philipp64>	Well, it will get built again for f29 release, right?
Jul 23 19:53:27 <nirik>	if you or someone else rebuilds it...
Jul 23 19:55:10 <philipp64>	yeah…. I just wanted to make sure that it got updated…. double-checked that all of my .patch files had made their way upstream (just filed a PR for the one which hadn't)… and asked the maintainer to release 2.3.11…
Jul 23 19:55:48 <philipp64>	hopefully that will happen soon, and I can update all branches to 2.3.11…
Jul 23 23:16:31 <QuLogic>	does Fedora make any guarantees of utf-8 locale? I thought it doesn't, technically
Jul 23 23:16:53 <QuLogic>	latest icu recently switched to assuming utf-8, and setting any other default no longer does anything
Jul 23 23:31:52 <sdgathman>	So, I'm reading https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingDrafts/AutoConf#Using_autoconf.2Fautomake_in_spec_files
Jul 23 23:32:16 <sdgathman>	It seems to say I should pre-generate configure and Makefile, and supply them as sources?
Jul 23 23:32:40 <sdgathman>	Upstream doesn't supply configure, only configure.ac and Makefile.am
Jul 23 23:34:10 <sdgathman>	Or does that only apply when upstream supplies configure?
Jul 23 23:39:55 <airlied>	sdgathman: yeah don't do that, just run autogen.sh
Jul 23 23:40:00 <airlied>	or whatever thy supply
Jul 23 23:40:26 <sdgathman>	But then I have to include autoconf, automake, shtool, libtool, etc in BuildRequires.
Jul 23 23:40:30 <sdgathman>	Is that ok?
Jul 23 23:40:31 <airlied>	yes
Jul 23 23:40:42 <airlied>	at least we do that for quite a lot of packages
Jul 23 23:40:48 <airlied>	esp where you are building from git snapshots
Jul 23 23:40:55 <airlied>	instead of building from released tarballs
Jul 23 23:41:09 <sdgathman>	I'm packaging namecoin-core
Jul 23 23:41:17 <airlied>	and if you have to patch configure.ac it's insane to do anything else
Jul 23 23:41:42 <sdgathman>	Is there any reason why it isn't already packaged?
Jul 23 23:41:46 <sdgathman>	Some license problem?
Jul 23 23:41:53 <airlied>	we run autoreconf -vif in prep or build
Jul 23 23:43:17 *	airlied has no idea 
Jul 23 23:56:37 <sdgathman>	It used to be openssl had ECC disabled, but that's all ok now.
Jul 24 00:50:26 <sdgathman>	Does pkgconfig go in a devel subpkg?
Jul 24 01:05:23 <Son_Goku>	sdgathman, yes
Jul 24 01:05:23 <Son_Goku>	pkgconfig files go in the devel subpackage

Jul 24 03:41:06 <Caterpillar>	question about %dir             let's say we have a  %{_datadir}/foo/hello file and foo is the package that owns it. Tell me if the two following %files alternatives are equivalent:         1)           %dir %{_datadir}/foo   (and on next line)    %{_datadir}/foo/hello                                2)   %{_datadir}/foo/                                     I got the second alternative from https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:
Jul 24 03:41:08 <Caterpillar>	UnownedDirectories#Unversioned  that says it includes the directory _and_ the entire tree below it.
Jul 24 03:44:36 <ignatenkobrain>	Caterpillar: yes
Jul 24 04:10:15 <Caterpillar>	ignatenkobrain: thank you very much
Jul 24 04:11:19 <bexelbie>	When I have a FTBFS bug in rawhide, once I patch my spec, can I just close it with a link to the successful build or do I need to do more? (like wait on it to push to rawhide somewhere)?
Jul 24 04:12:49 <ignatenkobrain>	bexelbie: close it
Jul 24 04:12:53 <bexelbie>	ty!
Jul 24 04:12:58 <pingou>	most often we build, but you can close it yes
Jul 24 04:14:08 <bexelbie>	guess who forgot to bump the spec :P
Jul 24 04:27:51 <pbrobinson>	Rathann: do you actually use opal?
Jul 24 05:22:21 <ignatenkobrain>	because last version was ftbfs so it didn't exist
Jul 24 05:22:24 <ignatenkobrain>	;)
Jul 24 05:22:24 <ignatenkobrain>	bexelbie: you actually don't need to bump release
Jul 24 05:27:26 <twoerner>	are there issues with the copr builders?
Jul 24 05:31:55 <bexelbie>	ignatenkobrain, ugh - too late
Jul 24 05:44:36 <Rathann>	pbrobinson: no, but I'm Cc'd to the bundled libraries tracker bug
Jul 24 05:55:53 <ignatenkobrain>	bexelbie: doesn't really matter ;)
Jul 24 06:32:13 <bexelbie>	it will when you see the commits it took :P
Jul 24 09:20:20 <pingou>	the state of python packaging with some branches having py2- and py3- other being py- and py3- is making things quite a headache...
Jul 24 09:46:20 <kashyap>	Hi folks
Jul 24 09:46:29 <kashyap>	After a long while, I'm reviewing a package
Jul 24 09:46:49 <kashyap>	Despite the spec having the %prep, %build, and %install sections, it still throws:
Jul 24 09:46:54 <kashyap>	$> rpmlint python-osc-placement.spec
Jul 24 09:46:54 <kashyap>	python-osc-placement.spec: W: no-%prep-section
Jul 24 09:46:55 <kashyap>	python-osc-placement.spec: W: no-%build-section
Jul 24 09:46:55 <kashyap>	python-osc-placement.spec: W: no-%install-section
Jul 24 09:46:56 <kashyap>	[...]
Jul 24 09:47:28 <rdieter>	kashyap: mind doing: fpaste python-osc-placement.spec ?
Jul 24 09:47:39 <rdieter>	so we can double-check?
Jul 24 09:47:50 <kashyap>	YSure
Jul 24 09:48:11 <rdieter>	or provide a link to the .spec in question
Jul 24 09:48:25 <kashyap>	`fpaste` is super slow for me
Jul 24 09:48:34 <kashyap>	So I get the spec URL: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mdbooth/8b70d11cbb97c1620afab9c7e618612e/raw/45f79e3d5830e49ffc1a405c37f4f528d2730a2f/python-osc-placement.spec
Jul 24 09:49:42 <rdieter>	kashyap: odd, for me rpmlint returns only: 0 packages and 1 specfiles checked; 0 errors, 0 warnings.
Jul 24 09:50:11 <rdieter>	using rpmlint-1.10-16.fc28.noarch
Jul 24 09:50:48 *	kashyap looks
Jul 24 09:50:57 <kashyap>	I'm using: rpmlint-1.10-5.fc27.noarch
Jul 24 09:53:00 <rdieter>	wierd, it's clear in this case rpmlint output for you is wrong.
Jul 24 09:53:49 <kashyap>	rdieter: Yeah, but isn't yours buggy?
Jul 24 09:54:08 <kashyap>	The I didn't post the two _errors_, BTW:
Jul 24 09:54:08 <kashyap>	python-osc-placement.spec: E: specfile-error error: line 8: Unknown tag: <!DOCTYPE html>
Jul 24 09:54:11 <kashyap>	python-osc-placement.spec: E: specfile-error error: query of specfile python-osc-placement.spec failed, can't parse
Jul 24 09:54:41 <rdieter>	kashyap: ah, looks like your spec is corrupted
Jul 24 09:54:56 <rdieter>	maybe you downloaded the html and not the raw content
Jul 24 09:55:01 <kashyap>	Damn
Jul 24 09:55:02 <kashyap>	Let me check
Jul 24 09:55:12 <kashyap>	I made sure to click on the "raw" thing
Jul 24 09:55:26 <kashyap>	Sigh, yes
Jul 24 09:59:02 <Pharaoh_Atem>	zbyszek: I just noticed, did we always have a git snapshot of 238 for systemd?
Jul 24 09:59:05 <Pharaoh_Atem>	in Fedora 28
Jul 24 10:19:48 <zbyszek>	Pharaoh_Atem: it's a git snapshot of the systemd 238-stable branch
Jul 24 10:20:30 <zbyszek>	So it starts out as not-a-git-snapshot with the 238 stag, then it gets a few backported patches, and then at some point, where there's enough patches, I generate a -stable branch, and when systemd is built from that, it becomes "a git snapshot"
Jul 24 10:21:01 <zbyszek>	It's a matter of convenience — putting 100 patches in dist-git is more work than pointing at the righ tgithub tarball
Jul 24 10:23:54 <kashyap>	puiterwijk++
Jul 24 10:27:12 <Pharaoh_Atem>	zbyszek: okay, just making sure about that
Jul 24 10:46:05 <bunny__>	For someone who has permission to edit the wiki, this page is currently empty: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackageMaintainers/ApprovedReviewRequests
Jul 24 11:13:51 <hmufam>	Hey
Jul 24 11:14:04 <hmufam>	Quick question about creating rpms and specs
Jul 24 11:14:14 <hmufam>	is there a way to set the source to something using github
Jul 24 11:14:19 <hmufam>	I tried to just get the tar
Jul 24 11:14:32 <hmufam>	but it doesn't include submodules
Jul 24 11:14:44 <tomhughes>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:SourceURL#Git_Hosting_Services
Jul 24 11:14:52 <tomhughes>	ah no it won't get submodules
Jul 24 11:14:56 <hmufam>	yep
Jul 24 11:15:02 <tomhughes>	but they typically want to be unbundled anyway
Jul 24 11:15:17 <hmufam>	so what do you think the solution would be?
Jul 24 11:15:22 <hmufam>	since the package when building
Jul 24 11:15:41 <hmufam>	looks for a cmakelists.txt inside of where the submodule should be
Jul 24 11:15:48 <tomhughes>	well it entirely depends on the package
Jul 24 11:16:24 <bowlofeggs>	adamw: you know what i just realized? i've never seen a puiterwijk clone with a goatee…
Jul 24 11:16:47 <hmufam>	tomhughes: for reference, the submodules are xpp and i3ipcpp
Jul 24 11:16:54 <hmufam>	and the program i'm trying to package is polybar
Jul 24 11:18:03 <hmufam>	Would it be possible for me to get the submodules separately, and then move them in before compiling?
Jul 24 11:19:32 <tomhughes>	well if those are effectively separate libraries then ideally they should be packaged separately
Jul 24 11:19:43 <tomhughes>	and then BuildRequired in the other package
Jul 24 11:21:18 <hmufam>	I agree, but the issue is cmake wants those packages
Jul 24 11:21:43 <tomhughes>	well that's just a question of patching things a bit I expect
Jul 24 11:22:28 <tomhughes>	if you're not going to unbundle then I would probably have three SourceN lines and untar them into the right places
Jul 24 11:22:59 <tomhughes>	but it means every time you update the main package you'lll have to check if the dependencies need an update
Jul 24 11:23:29 <hmufam>	I'd make that trade off
Jul 24 11:23:34 <hmufam>	realistically not much of a problem
Jul 24 11:25:12 <hmufam>	and tomhughes, the dependencies aren't in fedoras repos
Jul 24 11:25:19 <hmufam>	since the author of polybar wrote them
Jul 24 11:30:31 <hmufam>	tomhughes: hmm, where can I control where it untars?
Jul 24 11:30:43 <hmufam>	it'd probably be in %prep
Jul 24 11:31:27 <hmufam>	but what command could I use to specify where and how
Jul 24 11:34:38 <tomhughes>	I suspect in this case you'll just have to do it by hand after %setup
Jul 24 11:34:56 <tomhughes>	there are switches to %setup to make it untar other things but only at the top level
Jul 24 11:34:56 <hmufam>	sure
Jul 24 11:35:17 <hmufam>	and what variables do i use to refer to the different sources
Jul 24 11:35:30 <hmufam>	just %{Source1}?
Jul 24 11:36:49 <ajax>	there's also a %{sources} for all of them, as a list
Jul 24 11:37:00 <ajax>	but yes, %{source1} will give you the file from the Source1: line
Jul 24 11:37:04 <hmufam>	ajax: Yeah, but I only need to move 2 of the
Jul 24 11:37:28 <hmufam>	and is it does {Source1} point to the tar?
Jul 24 11:37:36 <hmufam>	or the untarred folder
Jul 24 11:37:46 <hmufam>	after %autosetup
Jul 24 11:38:41 <ajax>	to the tarball
Jul 24 11:38:54 <hmufam>	is there a variable that points to the untarred place?
Jul 24 11:39:45 <ajax>	not directly. there's %{sourcedir}, which points to the top level work directory. your unpacked sources will be somewhere below that based on the arguments you pass to %setup
Jul 24 11:39:54 <adamw>	bowlofeggs: this is because goatees are evil, and the puiterwijk collective understands this.
Jul 24 11:39:59 <ajax>	excuse me, %{builddir} i think.
Jul 24 11:40:13 <ajax>	%{sourcedir} is where the source tarballs are found at build time, which needn't be the same place.
Jul 24 11:40:44 <hmufam>	so would it be redundant to untar them again into {source0}
Jul 24 11:40:58 <hmufam>	and would it just be better to mv them into it?
Jul 24 11:41:04 <hmufam>	instead of using tar to set the location
Jul 24 11:41:16 <ignatenkobrain>	use -a 1
Jul 24 11:41:24 <ignatenkobrain>	or -b 1
Jul 24 11:41:27 <ignatenkobrain>	rpm will unpack it for you
Jul 24 11:41:40 <hmufam>	ignatenkobrain: what do these do?
Jul 24 11:42:29 <ignatenkobrain>	http://ftp.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-inside-macros.html
Jul 24 11:47:36 <hmufam>	ignatenkobrain: is there a way I can change where it goes inside of the directory using the options? Or should I just forgo the macro
Jul 24 11:47:56 <hmufam>	Since the second source has to be inside of a folder thats inside of the source0
Jul 24 11:48:43 <sharkcz>	adamw: hi, is staging openqa expected to be down? I get the fedora generic "service unavailable" page
Jul 24 11:49:04 <hmufam>	ignatenkobrain: its not just source0 --> source1, it becomes source0 --> folder inside source0 --> source1
Jul 24 11:50:49 <tibbs>	hmufam: When I have to do that I either just unpack manually or use -a 1 and then either rename the directory that creates or make a symlink.
Jul 24 11:50:59 <ignatenkobrain>	hmufam: IIRC not, but you can use %{uncompress:%{S:1}} in for you want it in
Jul 24 11:51:11 <adamw>	sharkcz: sort of
Jul 24 11:51:19 <adamw>	(i shut it down on purpose and forgot to shut it back up again)
Jul 24 11:52:22 <hmufam>	ignatenkobrain: not understanding that, so I would cd into the directory and the ${uncompress:{S:1}}?
Jul 24 11:52:57 <ignatenkobrain>	hmufam: yes, but you forgot %
Jul 24 11:53:09 <ignatenkobrain>	Please copy command as is :)
Jul 24 11:53:15 <ignatenkobrain>	As I wrote it I mean
Jul 24 11:53:27 <hmufam>	ok, that makes sense
Jul 24 11:55:05 <hmufam>	tibbs: if i did it your way and just did -a 1 to unpack into the directory before moving it, I would have to use -T -D -a 1, correct?
Jul 24 11:57:18 <tibbs>	I'm afraid I don't have enough context to know exactly what it is you might need.
Jul 24 11:57:33 <tibbs>	But... try it.  Doing "fedpkg prep" doesn't take a long time, after all.
Jul 24 11:57:40 <tibbs>	Experimentation is essentially free.
Jul 24 11:59:21 <TC01>	hi rwmjones: any chance you can update ocaml-re to 1.7.3 in Rawhide? The final release of opam 2.0.0 needs at least 1.7.2.
Jul 24 12:01:58 <TC01>	(specifically, ocaml-re 1.7.2 did this: "Deprecate all Re_* modules. Re_x is now available as Re.X", and opam 2.0.0 wants the new names, it seems.)
Jul 24 12:09:11 <hmufam>	wtf guys
Jul 24 12:09:14 <hmufam>	am I tripping?
Jul 24 12:14:29 <adamw>	sharkcz: i am testing a thing on it, i'll put it back up later
Jul 24 12:14:50 <sharkcz>	adamw: ok, no problem
Jul 24 12:33:49 <bowlofeggs>	adamw: how does the puiterwijk collective reach consensus?
Jul 24 13:26:12 <hmufam>	another question guys
Jul 24 13:26:28 <hmufam>	So i figured out my first problem
Jul 24 13:26:38 <hmufam>	but how do I specify which files to patch
Jul 24 13:26:59 <hmufam>	because the %patch is asking me "Files to patch:"
Jul 24 13:27:10 <hmufam>	and i feel like that is wrong
Jul 24 13:27:34 <ajax>	it's asking that because it doesn't have the right -pN to apply correctly
Jul 24 13:29:02 <hmufam>	ajax: where is there a -pN?
Jul 24 13:29:07 <hmufam>	I can't find mention of this
Jul 24 13:29:30 <hmufam>	oh
Jul 24 13:29:35 <hmufam>	N as in number
Jul 24 13:29:43 <ajax>	it's an argument to %patch, like it's an argument to patch(1)
Jul 24 13:31:24 <hmufam>	hmm
Jul 24 13:31:27 <hmufam>	it worked with -p0
Jul 24 15:32:17 <adamw>	bowlofeggs: battle royale.
Jul 24 15:33:48 <bowlofeggs>	heh
Jul 24 16:38:13 <volter>	I think OpenIPMI in Rawhide needs a rebuild, due to a soname version bump in net-snmp-libs.
Jul 24 16:38:18 <volter>	(30 vs 35)
Jul 24 17:02:51 <volter>	Thanks for the e-mail!
Jul 24 17:26:32 <adamw>	volter: i'm rebuilding it atm.
Jul 24 17:26:34 <adamw>	(and all the others).
Jul 24 17:26:36 <adamw>	(and all the libconfig ones).
Jul 24 17:33:51 <tibbs>	Oh, I already did cyrus-imapd.
Jul 24 17:34:34 <adamw>	i won't do ones you've done
Jul 24 17:34:35 <adamw>	i'm checking
Jul 24 17:34:39 <tibbs>	Assuming it builds on all architectures, which sometimes doesn't happen.
Jul 24 17:34:48 <adamw>	i'm on collectd atm, it has some deps that need fixing.
Jul 24 17:35:01 <tibbs>	But of course.
Jul 24 17:35:12 <tibbs>	I can start from the end if you like.
Jul 24 17:35:18 <adamw>	sure, why not, we'll meet in the middle
Jul 24 17:35:26 <adamw>	i did tog-pegasus already
Jul 24 17:35:30 <adamw>	as one of the libconfig ones depended on that
Jul 24 17:35:52 <adamw>	soname bump bingo!
Jul 24 17:37:56 <nirik>	collectd is is blocked by liboping
Jul 24 17:39:47 <tibbs>	zabbix is also broken because of gcc.
Jul 24 17:51:05 <tibbs>	rsyslog doesn't build because it needs rst2man.  And interestingly, there was no attempt to build it during the mass rebuild.
Jul 24 17:53:28 <tibbs>	Interestingly it seems that rst2man has moved from python2-docutils in F28 to python3-docutils.  I wonder what that breaks.
Jul 24 17:53:50 <nirik>	yes it did.
Jul 24 17:54:05 <nirik>	rsyslog at least apparently... but it should be easy to fix.
Jul 24 17:54:11 <tibbs>	Yeah, I'm doing it now.
Jul 24 17:54:29 <tibbs>	Just trying to determine if they use the same specfile on release branches.
Jul 24 17:55:01 <tibbs>	It's actually not all that easy to figure that out.
Jul 24 17:55:50 <tibbs>	And I just love it when drops a load of tracebacks.
Jul 24 17:58:10 <volter>	adamw++
Jul 24 17:59:28 <tibbs>	quagga doesn't build because of some weird texlive thing.
Jul 24 17:59:31 <tibbs>	package texlive-scheme-tetex-7:svn44187-17.fc29.noarch requires texlive-collection-mathscience, but none of the providers can be installed
Jul 24 18:00:07 <adamw>	ah god run away
Jul 24 18:00:14 <adamw>	correction, call spot then run away
Jul 24 18:00:23 <tibbs>	I am intimately familiar with texlive lately, unfortunately.
Jul 24 18:00:26 <adamw>	shouldn't it *tell* you why none of the providers can be installed, though?
Jul 24 18:00:35 <adamw>	probably just yet another thing needs rebuilidng...
Jul 24 18:00:41 <tibbs>	nothing provides texlive-apxproof needed by texlive-collection-mathscience-7:2017-17.fc29.noarch
Jul 24 18:00:45 <adamw>	i don't care, you should still run away. :P
Jul 24 18:00:54 <tibbs>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1599508
Jul 24 18:01:11 <tibbs>	I actually have the texlive spec able to generate most of itself from within itself.
Jul 24 18:01:46 <tibbs>	But I'm afraid that if I give it the power of our build farm, it will become self aware.
Jul 24 18:03:41 <adamw>	i'm on openhpi atm, btw
Jul 24 18:03:47 <tibbs>	ptpd
Jul 24 18:03:56 <adamw>	tibbs: i'm pretty sure donald trump is actually built by the texlive spec somewhere.
Jul 24 18:04:42 <tibbs>	OK, does none of this stuff actually build?
Jul 24 18:04:53 <adamw>	some of it needs BuildRequires: gcc
Jul 24 18:05:11 <smooge>	f28 was a perfect release. i think we should call ourselves good and just retire
Jul 24 18:06:19 <tibbs>	 /usr/include/openssl/ossl_typ.h:92:30: error: conflicting types for 'EVP_MD_CTX'
Jul 24 18:06:26 <adamw>	man, you sure do pick 'em
Jul 24 18:06:36 <adamw>	texlive and openssl, the perfect combination
Jul 24 18:06:39 <tibbs>	ptpd built ok during the rebuild.
Jul 24 18:07:25 <tibbs>	And openssl hasn't changed in a month.  Plus it failed the mass rebuild.
Jul 24 18:07:59 <tibbs>	dep/../dep/ntpengine/ntp_isc_md5.h:83:41: note: previous declaration of 'EVP_MD_CTX' was here
Jul 24 18:08:07 <adamw>	boy, i sure am glad *you* started from the bottom of the list.
Jul 24 18:08:10 <tibbs>	So what the hell?
Jul 24 18:08:57 <adamw>	build went down a different path this time for some reason, would be my guess
Jul 24 18:09:03 <adamw>	compare to the build log from the mas rebuild
Jul 24 18:10:52 <adamw>	ok, i've got php now (php-snmp)
Jul 24 18:11:11 <adamw>	so we're at least working on the whole list
Jul 24 18:11:20 <adamw>	if all mine get done successfully i'll try and help with yours...
Jul 24 18:12:00 <tibbs>	Well the texlive thing is going to have to wait for a texlive update.
Jul 24 18:12:18 <tibbs>	I could probably do what needs to be done but I'm not sure I want to go that far into it.
Jul 24 18:12:53 <adamw>	sensible.
Jul 24 18:13:27 <tibbs>	OK, so the net-snmp update actually broke ptpd.
Jul 24 18:14:52 <tibbs>	Now it ends up including ossl_typ.h where before it didn't.
Jul 24 18:23:13 <tibbs>	Well I got it to build.
Jul 24 18:23:51 <tibbs>	By just renaming EVP_MD_CTX to EVP_MD_CTX2 in the two places it appeared in the code.
Jul 24 18:28:51 <adamw>	#shipit
Jul 24 18:29:07 *	adamw decides he really doesn't care about whatever fking autotools bug is breaking ntop because he doesn't care about ntop.
Jul 24 18:30:12 <tibbs>	"ntop users can use a a web browser (e.g. netscape) to navigate through ntop"
Jul 24 18:30:34 <tibbs>	dnf install Mosaic
Jul 24 18:31:08 <tibbs>	(it is actually packaged in rpmfusion-nonfree).
Jul 24 18:32:09 <adamw>	well, they replaced it with ntopng like five years ago
Jul 24 18:32:13 <adamw>	and we never changed over
Jul 24 18:32:18 <adamw>	so our package is some ancient version
Jul 24 18:32:29 <adamw>	of course, ntopng is open core...dunno if ntop was
Jul 24 18:32:49 <tibbs>	main admin of ntop is our friend orphan.
Jul 24 18:33:47 *	nirik gets 180 emails from the f29 FTBFS tracker. Wonder if I should remove myself from cc there. ;)

Jul 24 18:36:38 <adamw>	.....wat
Jul 24 18:38:41 <tibbs>	depends on what "shell" is, I guess.
Jul 24 18:38:49 <adamw>	well it depends on a whole heap of stuff
Jul 24 18:39:11 <adamw>	but the part i don't get is, why does it basically check...something...that involves calling 'python', then if it succeeds, decide the value should be 'python2'
Jul 24 18:39:26 <adamw>	correction: the most important part i don't get
Jul 24 18:39:26 <adamw>	:P
Jul 24 18:39:35 <adamw>	anyway, going to hack around that heap of garbage, tum ti tum
Jul 25 05:04:24 <ignatenkobrain>	adamw: oh god!

Jul 25 10:20:27 <gicmo>	yeah, spam it surely is

Jul 25 11:05:28 <dalley>	mrunge, what are the chances that python-celery could be upgraded 4.0.2 -> 4.2.1 in Fedora 28?
Jul 25 11:05:54 <dalley>	we've gotten some bug reports about 4.0.2 where it is apparently fixed in newer version https://pulp.plan.io/issues/3882
Jul 25 11:06:25 <dalley>	and 4.0.z isn't getting upstream updates anymore, so the alternative is patch-carrying
Jul 25 11:07:13 <dalley>	4.2.0 is currently in rawhide
Jul 25 11:08:02 <carlwgeorge>	dalley: it's already 4.2.0 in rawhide, so for the maintainer it's just a matter of `git checkout f28 && git merge master`.  they just first have to review https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Updates_Policy and make sure that 4.0->4.2 is permissible.

Jul 25 11:14:53 <bunny__>	Tempted to spin up a VM and open those links though
Jul 25 11:15:07 <gnat42>	yeah, I have the same thought every time
Jul 25 11:15:26 <gnat42>	or maybe just use lynx or something like that when you're feeling adventurous

Jul 25 14:16:09 <mrunge>	dalley: we can do that, we just need to make sure we don't break anyone
Jul 25 14:16:54 <mrunge>	dalley: celery and kombu and (something I forgot the name of) are tightly connected; upgrading just one component doesn't really work
Jul 25 14:18:10 <dalley>	either billiard or vine probably
Jul 25 14:18:32 <dalley>	acknowledged, it probably would require several package updates
Jul 25 14:20:28 <dalley>	alternatively we could just apply the one patch, but since 4.0.z isn't supported anymore, maybe just upgrading is better?  idk
Jul 25 14:20:32 <dalley>	patch: https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/3752/files
Jul 25 14:27:24 <dalley>	mrunge ^
Jul 25 14:30:04 <mrunge>	dalley: yes, then it's 4 packages to upgrade, yes
Jul 25 14:32:15 <mrunge>	dalley: hmm, I'd apply the patch to 4.0.x for f28. that would avoid upgrading all other packages
Jul 25 14:33:53 <mrunge>	dalley: could you please file a bug against celery and link the patch there? That would help me to remember
Jul 25 14:35:13 <dalley>	mrunge, ok
Jul 25 14:35:54 <nirik>	huh, the latest qt5-qtwebkit is 800+MB? that seems a bit large...

Jul 25 14:42:07 <lupinix>	as the spin composes failed only on x86_64, qt5-qtwebkit should be small in i686 for example
Jul 25 14:42:11 *	lupinix checks
Jul 25 14:42:39 <lupinix>	indeed
Jul 25 14:42:45 <lupinix>	~50mb on i686
Jul 25 14:42:59 <lupinix>	768mb on x86_64
Jul 25 14:43:03 <lupinix>	that explains it
Jul 25 14:44:39 <lupinix>	the previous build is ~13mb on each arch for main package
Jul 25 14:47:51 <rdieter>	confirmed that the latest build didn't include the equivalent of: extracting debug info from /builddir/build/BUILDROOT/qt5-qtwebkit-5.212.0-0.25.alpha2.fc29.x86_64/usr/lib64/libQt5WebKit.so.5.212.0 (from the prior build)
Jul 25 14:48:57 <rdieter>	no idea why not though, I verified the lib has r-x permissions
Jul 25 14:50:57 <lupinix>	weird
Jul 25 14:51:48 <nirik>	annobin change?
Jul 25 14:51:58 <dalley>	mrunge, thank you https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1608542
Jul 25 14:52:56 <lupinix>	what changed with respect to annobin?
Jul 25 14:59:06 *	rdieter files a bug for tracking purposes
Jul 25 14:59:37 <lupinix>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=28602086
Jul 25 14:59:42 <lupinix>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=28602067
Jul 25 15:00:13 <lupinix>	fired up these to see whether the changes in latest build have an effect
Jul 25 15:05:37 <rdieter>	lupinix: thanks, good idea
Jul 25 15:05:47 <rdieter>	.bug 1608549
Jul 25 15:05:49 <zodbot>	rdieter: Bug 1608549 – qt5-qtwebkit: find-debuginfo fails to process libQt5WebKit.so - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1608549
Jul 25 15:08:38 <nirik>	I bet it's rpm?
Jul 25 15:09:03 <rdieter>	nirik: possible, I'll verify buildroot differences
Jul 25 15:10:18 <rdieter>	old rpm-build-4.14.2-0.rc1.1.fc29.1 vs new rpm-build-4.14.2-0.rc1.1.fc29.2 , so prob not
Jul 25 15:10:32 <adamw>	have you tried just rebuilding it?
Jul 25 15:10:46 <adamw>	there was another similar case, llvm6.0
Jul 25 15:10:48 <rdieter>	not I, lupinux is doing some scratch builds
Jul 25 15:10:49 <adamw>	-3 was huge, -4 was smaller
Jul 25 15:10:58 <adamw>	i think all tstellar did was rebuild it
Jul 25 15:10:59 <nirik>	well, that change has a change to find-debuginfo
Jul 25 15:11:27 <rdieter>	and... latest rawhide has rpm-4.14.2-0.rc1.2.fc29
Jul 25 15:11:43 <nirik>	ah, ok.
Jul 25 15:12:04 <adamw>	oh, hum, the second llvm6.0 build was before the qt5-qtwebkit build, though...hrm.
Jul 25 15:12:27 <rdieter>	rpm changelog says: - Decompress DWARF compressed ELF sections
Jul 25 15:13:31 <ignatenkobrain>	rdieter: do you have link to build.log?
Jul 25 15:13:32 <ignatenkobrain>	that would be handy
Jul 25 15:13:41 <adamw>	https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/1181/28571181/build.log
Jul 25 15:14:13 <ignatenkobrain>	argh, still loading
Jul 25 15:14:17 <ignatenkobrain>	and eating my cpu
Jul 25 15:14:20 <ignatenkobrain>	to render
Jul 25 15:14:46 <ignatenkobrain>	wait, build.log -- 193M?
Jul 25 15:14:48 <rdieter>	warning, it's huge'ish
Jul 25 15:15:02 <adamw>	wget it
Jul 25 15:15:07 <adamw>	it doesn't seem especially helpful though
Jul 25 15:15:10 <ignatenkobrain>	already
Jul 25 15:15:13 <adamw>	as rdieter said, it's like the library is just...skipped entirely
Jul 25 15:15:31 <adamw>	https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/psdbna4bZqZCuCAWpN~xRQ
Jul 25 15:15:36 <ignatenkobrain>	it might be the case that first dwz runs and then we uncompress it
Jul 25 15:15:40 <adamw>	note that /usr/lib64/libQt5WebKit.so.5.212.0 isn't listed there at all
Jul 25 15:20:40 <ignatenkobrain>	echo "explicitly decompress any DWARF compressed ELF sections in $f"
Jul 25 15:20:44 <ignatenkobrain>	I don't see this at all
Jul 25 15:20:49 <ignatenkobrain>	which makes me wonder
Jul 25 15:24:00 <adamw>	let's check what rpm it was even built with...
Jul 25 15:24:47 <adamw>	rpm-4.14.2-0.rc1.1.fc29.2.x86_64
Jul 25 15:24:50 <adamw>	i.e. the one before that change
Jul 25 15:28:20 <adamw>	it seems like the only way we *wouldn't* see "extracting debug info from" for a file is if debugfn exists, or do_file somehow isn't called at all...
Jul 25 15:28:50 <nirik>	as is so often the case... it comes down to a janky shell script. ;)
Jul 25 15:29:17 <adamw>	i'm sort of tempted to just rebuild the bloody thing and see what happens?
Jul 25 15:29:51 <adamw>	so in case it wasn't clear - i think you were wrong with "<nirik> well, that change has a change to find-debuginfo"
Jul 25 15:30:08 <adamw>	the change came between rpm-build-4.14.2-0.rc1.1.fc29.2  and rpm-4.14.2-0.rc1.2.fc29
Jul 25 15:30:24 <adamw>	not between rpm-build-4.14.2-0.rc1.1.fc29.1 and rpm-build-4.14.2-0.rc1.1.fc29.2 (that change was just the mass rebuild)
Jul 25 15:31:22 <mboddu>	"<adamw> i'm sort of tempted to just rebuild the bloody thing and see what happens?" +1
Jul 25 15:32:40 <adamw>	in fact, note the *i686* build got stripped fine, in the same task...
Jul 25 15:33:19 <ignatenkobrain>	mboddu: agree here
Jul 25 15:33:23 <ignatenkobrain>	rebuild the bloody thing
Jul 25 15:33:24 <ignatenkobrain>	;)
Jul 25 15:34:08 <adamw>	still. hm. if we've got a kinda ongoing intermittent problem where debuginfo stripping sometimes fails...that's going to be bad
Jul 25 15:34:16 <adamw>	we really need to figure out when that started happening and fix it...
Jul 25 15:35:37 <adamw>	huh. actually, i686 is odd. the i686 build.log doesn't show the main library being stripped, but the package is much smaller on i686 than x86_64...
Jul 25 15:36:58 <adamw>	on i686 the library file is ~270MB, on x86_64 it's ~3.2GB...
Jul 25 15:36:59 <lupinix>	maybe that is not odd, afair we had to tweak flags to avoid out of memory
Jul 25 15:37:02 <adamw>	ah
Jul 25 15:37:32 <lupinix>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/qt5-qtwebkit/blob/master/f/qt5-qtwebkit.spec#_129
Jul 25 15:38:26 <adamw>	so...we reduce the debuginfo size for every arch but x86_64
Jul 25 15:38:33 <adamw>	that seems a bit arbitrary (why do it on ppc64le?) but anyway
Jul 25 15:38:42 <adamw>	explains the results
Jul 25 15:39:27 <lupinix>	adamw: result of try and error
Jul 25 15:40:19 <lupinix>	aarch64 should be huge too
Jul 25 15:40:39 <lupinix>	and… is
Jul 25 15:41:43 <adamw>	welp, if i pretended i understood find-debuginfo run_job, i'd be lying.
Jul 25 15:42:34 <ignatenkobrain>	adamw: everything what have changed is just new added call to "eu-elfcompress"
Jul 25 15:42:41 <ignatenkobrain>	with and echo
Jul 25 15:42:43 <adamw>	ignatenkobrain: the thing is, you didn't even change that :P
Jul 25 15:42:55 <ignatenkobrain>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/rpm/c/adbe3634b5b72209494d8ded1e68029485fc1121
Jul 25 15:42:58 <adamw>	ignatenkobrain: if you see what i mean - the bad build ran *without* that change, it used the previous version of the package
Jul 25 15:43:01 <adamw>	nirik read the nevrs wrong
Jul 25 15:43:23 <adamw>	so this is *definitely* not caused by that change, the problem is...we don't know what it *was* caused by
Jul 25 15:44:45 *	lupinix is wondering why https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=28602067 does not show option scratch = True although he used fedpkg scratch-build to fire it up
Jul 25 15:44:48 <nirik>	there was also possibly an annobin change?
Jul 25 15:45:13 <adamw>	so, here's the other case i saw, for reference
Jul 25 15:45:56 <rdieter>	'file' is used to identify stippable things too, it's output piped to:  sed -n -e 's/^\(.*\):[   ]*.*ELF.*, not stripped.*/\1/p'
Jul 25 15:46:05 <adamw>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1128831 is llvm6.0-6.0.1-3.fc29 , built 2018-07-19 , that's a *bad* build, note that stripping of libLLVM-6.0.so didn't happen
Jul 25 15:46:46 <adamw>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1129957 is llvm6.0-6.0.1-4.fc29, built 2018-07-23 , that's a *good* build, note that strpping of libLLVM-6.0.so *did* happen
Jul 25 15:46:56 <adamw>	so, seems like we have a very similar case happening at least back on the 19th
Jul 25 15:47:04 <adamw>	i don't know if there were others before that which no-one noticed yet...
Jul 25 15:48:02 <rdieter>	file-5.33-8.fc29 vs file-5.33-10.fc29.x86_64
Jul 25 15:48:35 <lupinix>	does it go weong for all architectures then? if it is purely random i guess not
Jul 25 15:48:38 <lupinix>	*wrong
Jul 25 15:48:57 <rdieter>	lupinix: I would guess yes (all archs), but haven't confirmed
Jul 25 15:49:54 <adamw>	i think the same lib was skipped on all arches in both problematic builds
Jul 25 15:49:59 <adamw>	but yes, haven't double checked that yet
Jul 25 15:50:00 <rdieter>	 184K qt5-qtwebkit-debuginfo-5.212.0-0.26.alpha2.fc29.i686.rpm vs 33M qt5-qtwebkit-debuginfo-5.212.0-0.25.alpha2.fc29.i686.rpm
Jul 25 15:50:12 <rdieter>	so at least i686 is affected too
Jul 25 15:50:15 <adamw>	yeah, i already checked i686
Jul 25 15:50:20 <rdieter>	k, fooey
Jul 25 15:51:47 *	rdieter waits for results from scratch builds
Jul 25 15:57:56 <adamw>	it sure looks like stripping worked on all arches in -25 and failed on all arches in -26
Jul 25 15:58:10 <adamw>	which seems...weird?...if this is a somehow quasi-random bug
Jul 25 15:58:12 <adamw>	very bizarre
Jul 25 16:01:00 <adamw>	ditto the llvm6.0 case, stripping was skipped on every arch in -3, happened on every arch in -4...
Jul 25 16:01:18 <lupinix>	so no random i guess
Jul 25 16:01:26 <adamw>	but in some way it *is*
Jul 25 16:02:11 <adamw>	because a build on 08-23 worked (llvm6.0 -4) but builds on 08-19 and 08-24 were broken (llvm6.0 -3 and qt5-qtwebkit)
Jul 25 16:02:35 <adamw>	if it's not random, every build should be hitting it...
Jul 25 16:02:38 <adamw>	so. what.
Jul 25 16:02:51 <adamw>	after lunch i'm gonna see if i can find any other affected builds...
Jul 25 16:04:13 <adamw>	oo. i wonder if what builder the job ran on is significant.
Jul 25 16:04:29 <adamw>	bah, no, they'll all be different for the different arches. grr
Jul 25 16:08:37 <lupinix>	nirik mentioned annobin… in fact many changes there https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=24421
Jul 25 16:08:48 <lupinix>	sometimes even two releases per day…
Jul 25 16:10:19 <adamw>	worth looking into...
Jul 25 16:11:17 *	lupinix thinks annobin should be skipped for production builds anyway and limited to some side tag
Jul 25 16:11:23 <lupinix>	already annoyed me too often
Jul 25 16:22:15 <lupinix>	the rebuild of qt5-qtwebkit-5.212.0-0.26.alpha2.fc29 is huge too
Jul 25 16:22:27 <lupinix>	that one https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=28602067
Jul 25 16:23:12 <lupinix>	0.25 also https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=28602088
Jul 25 16:23:27 <lupinix>	rdieter: so at least the changes in qt5-qtwebkit itself are not relevant
Jul 25 16:23:45 <lupinix>	and current rawhide seems to be in a state which produces broken builds
Jul 25 16:25:22 <rdieter>	forget, possible to disable annobin in a .spec?  that may be worth testing too then
Jul 25 16:25:53 <lupinix>	yes, will do now
Jul 25 16:34:57 <lupinix>	there we go, build with disabled annobin https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=28603395
Jul 25 16:39:22 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: hey, we chatted about adding me to maintain the el branch of python-pexpect a bit back, are you still willing to have me help with that? coudl you add me to the list to maintain that?
Jul 25 16:42:59 <rdieter>	since we ruled out qt5-qtwebkit packaging changes, I'll reassign it to rpm(build) for now
Jul 25 16:45:14 <rdieter>	.whoowns file
Jul 25 16:45:14 <zodbot>	rdieter: kdudka
Jul 25 16:48:17 <adamw>	both llvm -4 (where stripping worked) and qt5-qtwebkit -26 (where it didn't) were built with the same annobin (8.18-1.fc29)
Jul 25 16:48:22 <adamw>	which seems to rule annobin out...
Jul 25 16:51:40 <lupinix>	extracting debug info from /builddir/build/BUILDROOT/qt5-qtwebkit-5.212.0-0.26.alpha2.fc29.x86_64/usr/lib64/libQt5WebKit.so.5.212.0
Jul 25 16:51:51 <lupinix>	wih disabled annobin
Jul 25 16:51:56 <lupinix>	*with
Jul 25 16:52:28 <ignatenkobrain>	so the annobin it is?
Jul 25 16:52:55 <lupinix>	well…
Jul 25 16:52:55 <ignatenkobrain>	radez: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-pexpect -- you should already have access
Jul 25 16:53:05 <lupinix>	[22:48:17] <adamw> both llvm -4 (where stripping worked) and qt5-qtwebkit -26 (where it didn't) were built with the same annobin (8.18-1.fc29)
Jul 25 16:53:42 <adamw>	well, could be annobin behaving unpredictably, i guess
Jul 25 16:53:54 <adamw>	though that again begs the question why does it behave the same *across all arches in a build*...
Jul 25 16:55:14 <lupinix>	yes…
Jul 25 16:58:18 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: oh great! thanks very much, I didn't realize you had added me
Jul 25 16:58:32 <lupinix>	8.19-1.fc29 is used in all my test builds, while 8.18-1.fc29 has been used in the last non scratch build
Jul 25 17:00:22 <lupinix>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=28603398 size of resulting rpms is perfectly fine
Jul 25 17:01:38 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: 4.6 is also been released, are you ok with me updating master to 4.6 too?
Jul 25 17:02:12 <lupinix>	rdieter: i'm going to rebuild qt5-qtwebkit with disabled annobin now to get the composes working again
Jul 25 17:04:48 <ignatenkobrain>	radez: I would prefer if you send PR so that I review it
Jul 25 17:04:51 <ignatenkobrain>	but apart from that, yes
Jul 25 17:05:02 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: sure thing
Jul 25 17:05:42 <adamw>	lupinix: thanks
Jul 25 17:05:55 <adamw>	i'm just worried that this is probably affecting other things too...
Jul 25 17:05:59 <pessoft>	Hi, I'd like to help out with fixes on dokuwiki package. It seems that package is not attended by maintainers - there is no feedback on bugzilla tickets related on this for some months, or PRs for the package - and upstream is a few years ahead of the packages content. Any idea how I could contribute to the package? Thanks for any hints.
Jul 25 17:17:36 <rdieter>	lupinix: very interesting, thanks
Jul 25 17:18:16 *	adamw didn't find any other affected builds yet...
Jul 25 17:18:24 <adamw>	do we have a bug for this yet?
Jul 25 17:19:21 <rdieter>	adamw: I just reassigned the one I filed to annobin
Jul 25 17:19:40 <lupinix>	.bug 1608549
Jul 25 17:19:41 <zodbot>	lupinix: Bug 1608549 – find-debuginfo fails to process libQt5WebKit.so - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1608549
Jul 25 17:29:48 <ignatenkobrain>	I wonder if we would need one more mass rebuild due to annobin bugs
Jul 25 17:32:36 <lupinix>	yes…
Jul 25 17:38:07 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: thx for getting me added to the commiters list, I've filed a PR for 4.6. Have a good night!
Jul 25 17:45:23 <eclipseo>	pessoft: you could propose PR to update the package
Jul 25 17:48:34 <eclipseo>	pessoft: I see you did. If there is still no answer from the maintainers, follow this https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Policy_for_nonresponsive_package_maintainers#Outline
Jul 25 17:54:46 <adamw>	welp, i'm officially baffled by this bug...
Jul 25 18:16:24 <pessoft>	eclipseo: Thanks, I will check that policy.
Jul 25 18:23:43 <radez>	ignatenkobrain: as the package admin do you have access to unblock-pkg? I'm getting a blocked error when I try and build el7 for pexpect https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=28604376
Jul 25 18:29:23 <rsc>	radez: pexpect is part of RHEL, I think?
Jul 25 18:29:58 <rsc>	radez: http://mirror.centos.org/centos-7/7.5.1804/os/x86_64/Packages/ - pexpect *is* part of RHEL.
Jul 25 18:30:18 <rsc>	ignatenkobrain: ^
Jul 25 18:34:26 <tibbs>	Oh, nice, %dist is supposed to be defined in terms of %distprefix but... because of a missing '%' that doesn't happen.
Jul 25 18:36:19 <tibbs>	And somehow you can't file a PR against the fedora-release package on src.fedoraproject.org.
Jul 25 18:44:34 <tibbs>	Yep, even when I fork and push commits, I don't get the option to open a PR.
Jul 25 18:46:26 <radez>	rsc: hm, well I guess that fixes cent users to a really old version then :/ thx for pointing that out. I suppose I should abandon the epel7 updates
Jul 25 18:50:54 <tibbs>	Use of RHEL/Centos fixes you to whatever package versions it contains.  EPEL is not permitted to override, upgrade or conflict with RHEL packages.
Jul 25 18:51:34 <rsc>	radez: yes, no pexpect updates in epel7 :(
Jul 25 18:51:55 <tibbs>	If the EPEL7 branch isn't retired already, it really should be.
Jul 25 18:52:20 <radez>	it was, we just tried to resurrect it, but I'll cancel that
Jul 25 18:52:21 <rsc>	tibbs: there is even no epel7 branch: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pexpect
Jul 25 18:52:26 <tibbs>	Oh, it doesn't even have an epel7 branch.
Jul 25 18:52:36 <tibbs>	So that's certainly not an issue either.
Jul 25 18:52:39 <rsc>	radez: oh, you tried to branch it? Then cancel it, please.
Jul 25 18:52:46 <radez>	no it was already branched
Jul 25 18:52:52 <radez>	but had a dead.package file in it
Jul 25 18:52:53 <rsc>	radez: aside of that, the package in Fedora is meanwhile also named differently...
Jul 25 18:53:17 <tibbs>	Yeah, that's why it was retired in Fedora; it was renamed.
Jul 25 18:53:33 <tibbs>	And no, it doesn't have an epel7 branch.
Jul 25 18:53:47 <tibbs>	Nor has it ever had one; we don't delete branches.
Jul 25 18:53:47 <radez>	oh, I'm looking at python-pexpect not pexpect
Jul 25 18:53:58 <radez>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-pexpect
Jul 25 18:54:16 <tibbs>	Now, it does have a live el6 branch.
Jul 25 18:54:23 <radez>	whats the policy of a package being in epel that has a different name like that?
Jul 25 18:54:44 <rsc>	radez: you are still not allowed to replace a package in RHEL ;-)
Jul 25 18:54:59 <radez>	bah
Jul 25 18:55:01 <tibbs>	As long as it doesn't conflict and doesn't update the package, it is fine.
Jul 25 18:55:20 <radez>	oh?
Jul 25 18:55:24 <rsc>	IIRC it conflicts via path names.
Jul 25 18:55:44 <radez>	yea it has the same module name so it would conflict
Jul 25 18:55:49 <tibbs>	Exactly.
Jul 25 18:56:11 <radez>	kk, so back it out and el7 users are stuck on the old version for now?
Jul 25 18:56:18 <tibbs>	The whole point of EPEL is that you can enable it and not go out of support for your base OS.
Jul 25 18:56:31 <radez>	right
Jul 25 18:56:35 <tibbs>	If it updated packages then that would violate that rather important rule.
Jul 25 18:56:36 <rsc>	radez: right. Except you introduce python3x-pexpect.
Jul 25 18:56:48 <rsc>	radez: (do you really care about python2?)
Jul 25 18:57:06 <tibbs>	You can certainly add a python3 module, yes.  There are two whole python3 stacks in EPEL7 already.
Jul 25 18:57:24 <rsc>	Two stacks even? So yes, pexpect for python3 would be nice.
Jul 25 18:57:38 <radez>	hm, maybe I'll just pull the py2 stuff out
Jul 25 18:57:43 <tibbs>	python34 and python36.
Jul 25 18:57:58 <radez>	it doesn't help RDO for now, but would benefit the comnunity
Jul 25 18:58:08 <tibbs>	Though I imagine they'll try to get rid of 34 and add 37 at some point.
Jul 25 18:58:14 <rsc>	Is RDO python2?
Jul 25 18:58:17 <tibbs>	Zero idea what RDO is.
Jul 25 18:58:21 <rsc>	OpenStack.
Jul 25 18:58:32 <radez>	all of openstack is py2 right now, there's a big effort to get it to py3
Jul 25 18:58:59 <rsc>	Oh dear. That fany, super, duper, hyped OpenStack is using ancient Python?
Jul 25 18:59:11 <tibbs>	What would you expect?
Jul 25 18:59:11 <radez>	I think most of it is compatible but there's hasn't been an official push to make everyone do the final switch over
Jul 25 18:59:33 <rsc>	tibbs: that's a good argument to not use RDO until Python 3.
Jul 25 18:59:34 <radez>	yea it's like a cruise ship, lots of hype and impossible to turn
Jul 25 19:01:08 <radez>	rsc: tibbs: while I have your ear, woudl this block error prevent me from pushing only py3 stuff to epel? https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=28604376
Jul 25 19:01:20 <radez>	ie if I pull ouf the py2 stuff woudl I still get that error
Jul 25 19:01:31 <tibbs>	Yes, you would.
Jul 25 19:01:32 <rsc>	radez: yes, I think so.
Jul 25 19:01:36 <radez>	:/
Jul 25 19:01:42 <tibbs>	The block is on the source package name.  Those cannot conflict either.
Jul 25 19:02:02 <rsc>	So new review for python3-pexpect needed?
Jul 25 19:02:11 <tibbs>	You must create a new python3-pexpect package, get it reviewed, import it, branch it for EPEL7, and retire the Fedora branch.
Jul 25 19:05:01 <radez>	kk, thx for the info
Jul 26 02:06:46 <RaphGro>	I would really like to know why stockfish FTBFS is magically fixed in rawhide
Jul 26 02:07:46 <RaphGro>	is ld part of binutils?
Jul 26 02:12:50 <RaphGro>	ok, it seems to be related to the annobin issue
Jul 26 08:28:23 <xvitaly>	Hello all. New author of Fedora Magazine offer readers to install packages via sudo make install: https://fedoramagazine.org/4-cool-apps-for-your-terminal/. Sudo make install will create lots of untracked files and can cause major problems on updates/upgrades. I think this article need to be removed because end users will damage their Fedora installation after using that.
Jul 26 08:44:55 <timothy>	hi, is Provides: something = 0:VERSION the same as Provides: something = VERSION ?
Jul 26 08:45:03 <timothy>	I mean, exactly the same?
Jul 26 08:45:17 <ignatenkobrain>	timothy: depends
Jul 26 08:45:17 <Son_Goku>	timothy, not quite
Jul 26 08:45:29 <xvitaly>	timothy, 0: means Epoch: 0.
Jul 26 08:45:39 <timothy>		epoch	(optional) number, with assumed default of 0 if not supplied
Jul 26 08:46:02 <Son_Goku>	for the purposes of EVR comparisons, it's effectively the same
Jul 26 08:46:02 <ignatenkobrain>	timothy: provides might behave differently.. what problem are you trying to solve?
Jul 26 08:47:47 <timothy>	ignatenkobrain: no problems, but since sometimes we forgot to change the provides to use %{epoch}: when we change the epoch I'm asking if we can always use it
Jul 26 08:48:40 <ignatenkobrain>	better not to have epoch in provides
Jul 26 08:48:48 <ignatenkobrain>	it makes everything worse
Jul 26 08:48:52 <ignatenkobrain>	until it's really needed
Jul 26 08:50:33 <ignatenkobrain>	timothy: so imagine you have Requires: (foo >= 1.0.0 with foo < 2.0.0)
Jul 26 08:51:20 <ignatenkobrain>	if you have Prv: foo = 1.5.0
Jul 26 08:51:23 <ignatenkobrain>	then it would work as expected
Jul 26 08:51:41 <ignatenkobrain>	but if you have Prv: foo = 1:1.5.0
Jul 26 08:51:42 <ignatenkobrain>	I'm not sure ;)
Jul 26 08:51:44 <ignatenkobrain>	because it won't satisfy < 2.0.0
Jul 26 08:51:51 <ignatenkobrain>	because it assumes that epoch=0
Jul 26 08:52:04 <ignatenkobrain>	timothy: tl;dr avoid putting epoch in provides ;)
Jul 26 08:52:18 <timothy>	ignatenkobrain: and in requires?
Jul 26 08:53:01 <ignatenkobrain>	timothy: depends which requires. as usual, don't put it there unless necessary
Jul 26 08:53:18 <ignatenkobrain>	timothy: I really need to know use-case to give you an answer

Jul 26 09:06:19 <jwendell>	hi folks, regarding packages in copr, it seems I can only see the last 3 builds from "repoquery --show-duplicates <package>"
Jul 26 09:06:46 <jwendell>	is that correct? Or am I supposed to see all builds of a given package?
Jul 26 09:27:36 <jwendell>	is there a setting somewhere where I can specify I want "unlimited" versions of packages to be available in the repo copr creates for us?
Jul 26 09:36:01 <jwendell>	hmm, for another package in the same repo, it lists only the last build/version

Jul 26 11:13:13 <tibbs>	I do not know if zodbot has been modified to talk to pagure yet (or to use the cached owner data that pagure provides).
Jul 26 11:13:19 <tibbs>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gnuradio will show you the maintainers.
Jul 26 11:13:25 <nirik>	it has, but we haven't updated it yet
Jul 26 11:13:31 <nirik>	thats on the list for today. ;)
Jul 26 11:13:44 <Dave_o>	tibbs: i figured something like that
Jul 26 11:13:47 <tibbs>	I was just going to volunteer to hack on it; glad I don't have to.
Jul 26 11:13:54 <Dave_o>	but thanks anyway
Jul 26 11:13:59 <Dave_o>	tibbs++
Jul 26 11:15:07 <tibbs>	I wonder if there's a command line utility for that.
Jul 26 11:16:07 <tibbs>	We have one that looks up maintainer info for a list of packages; I should just add an option to it.
Jul 26 11:18:35 <Dave_o>	welp... that is gonna be an email to maintainer and fedora-legal about gnuradio... it includes an dvb-t decoder which i'm pretty sure has patent problems
Jul 26 11:19:08 <tibbs>	gnuradio-maintainers@fedoraproject.org will reach the maintainers directly.  No need to look them up unless you just want to know where that goes.
Jul 26 11:19:25 <Dave_o>	ah, forgot about that
Jul 26 11:23:25 <nirik>	or better yet a bug. ;)
Jul 26 11:24:05 <tibbs>	You can have a bugzilla ticket block "FE-Legal" and the legal team will see it.

Jul 26 13:12:13 <RaphGro>	felt asleep?
Jul 26 13:19:21 <FranciscoD>	Is having BRs one per line in a spec necessary? The spec is very readable with two packages per BR too.
Jul 26 13:19:35 *	FranciscoD keeps getting this comment in reviews
Jul 26 13:20:00 <RaphGro>	I'm not aware of any policy for that
Jul 26 13:20:13 <RaphGro>	you may want to ask with a ticket to FPC
Jul 26 13:21:05 <RaphGro>	well, is vala unmaintained?
Jul 26 13:21:29 <RaphGro>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1447483
Jul 26 13:25:27 <tibbs>	The fedora-specific functionality of zodbot is not working currently.
Jul 26 13:25:52 <tibbs>	FranciscoD: It is certainly not necessary to have one dependency per line.
Jul 26 13:26:35 <tibbs>	Personally if there are many and they change only rarely then I try to cram them on as few lines as possible.
Jul 26 13:27:04 <tomhughes>	I tend not to, though I sometimes group related ones
Jul 26 13:27:10 <RaphGro>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/vala/commits/master
Jul 26 13:27:22 <tomhughes>	I've sometimes had reviewers ask the opposite though, to merge them where I had singlle lines!
Jul 26 13:27:22 <RaphGro>	hmm, it seems the mentioned bug 'll never get closed
Jul 26 13:27:35 <FranciscoD>	tibbs: yeh, i group related ones too. The one per line is merely making a long spec file just longer here
Jul 26 13:27:42 <RaphGro>	unusual case of rhbz
Jul 26 13:27:47 <FranciscoD>	tomhughes: that has never happened to me XD
Jul 26 13:28:12 <FranciscoD>	I guess it's just personal preference
Jul 26 13:28:20 <RaphGro>	indeed.
Jul 26 13:28:23 <tibbs>	RaphGro: There is no point in continuously opening new tickets; it's far better to just keep one.
Jul 26 13:28:40 <tibbs>	If it were closed, new-hotness would then open a separate one.
Jul 26 13:28:42 <RaphGro>	tibbs: anyways, not my business
Jul 26 13:28:57 <tibbs>	If you don't want new-hotness to file a ticket, then why not turn that off?
Jul 26 13:29:03 <RaphGro>	maybe vala upstream releases too often / too fast.
Jul 26 13:29:17 <RaphGro>	tibbs: I'm not maintainer of vala
Jul 26 13:29:26 <tibbs>	Well then why does it bother you?
Jul 26 13:29:35 <RaphGro>	I was in CC but dropped now
Jul 26 13:29:48 <RaphGro>	because of xfce4-vala
Jul 26 13:30:26 <tibbs>	The only real problem I see there is that anitya hasn't been taught to not spam about prerelases.
Jul 26 13:30:51 <RaphGro>	oh, is this implemented?
Jul 26 13:30:59 <tibbs>	It's just patterns.
Jul 26 13:31:11 <RaphGro>	remembering a ticket, long ago
Jul 26 13:31:40 <RaphGro>	yes, there's a custom option to give own regex
Jul 26 13:32:10 <tibbs>	And note that the package does get updated.  The ticket just doesn't get closed, presumably so that new-hotness will continue using the same ticket.
Jul 26 13:33:22 <RaphGro>	sure.
Jul 26 13:34:31 <RaphGro>	forgot to check pagure before asking about unmaintained
Jul 26 13:47:01 <tibbs>	The bugzilla ticket itself provided that information.
Jul 26 13:47:40 <tibbs>	Hotness tells you both the upstream version and the currently packaged version in the tickets it files.
Jul 26 13:52:51 <RaphGro>	tibbs: well, nevermind. my issue's solved. :)
Jul 26 14:14:29 *	RaphGro hates need to wait till pagure's fully loaded to enjoy ajax search
Jul 26 14:14:45 <RaphGro>	to can enjoy *
Jul 26 14:15:08 <RaphGro>	IMHO the search bar should appear not before that
Jul 26 14:16:17 *	ajax twitches
Jul 26 14:17:53 *	RaphGro blushes
Jul 26 14:34:27 <RaphGro>	tibbs: well, anitya could get changed to reopen the last closed ticket when there's another new release available.
Jul 26 14:34:59 <RaphGro>	the check seems to verify closed or not.
Jul 26 14:35:40 <tibbs>	That would be beyond annoying.  (And anitya doesn't file the bugs in any case; that's new-hotness.)
Jul 26 15:57:43 <TC01>	I just had a build fail with 'error retrieving sources'. Looking at mock_output.log it seems as though the call to curl segfaulted...?

Jul 26 16:18:15 <TC01>	nirik: is this just happening on builds for that package? Could something have gone wrong with python-seesaw's lookaside cache?
Jul 26 16:18:46 <nirik>	TC01: well, it works locally here, it works on the builder outside of mock, it fails inside of mock...
Jul 26 16:18:55 <TC01>	oh dear.

Jul 27 09:05:45 <sdgathman>	I know %{varname} substitution works inside here-is
Jul 27 09:06:15 <sdgathman>	I think the % macros are processed before feeding to shell
Jul 27 09:06:23 <ignatenkobrain>	%if works anywhere
Jul 27 09:06:37 <ignatenkobrain>	RPM doesn't care where's shell, only % macros important to rpm

Jul 27 11:38:03 <sdgathman>	I do man asprintf, and it tells me to

Jul 27 11:38:19 <sdgathman>	#include <stdio.h>
Jul 27 11:38:35 <sdgathman>	So I do - but it still doesn't know about asprintf
Jul 27 11:39:27 <rdieter>	sdgathman: do you have a build.log we can look it? Possible compiler flags are changing things? (e.g. redifining _GNU_SOURCE for example)
Jul 27 11:39:56 <sdgathman>	rdieter: moving #define to before first include per insns in feature_test_macros
Jul 27 11:40:31 <sdgathman>	That did it.

Jul 27 14:09:31 <tibbs>	I totally forgot that I made proper tab completion for fedpkg clone work in zsh (using the actual list of git repos that Fedora maintains instead of trying to extract it from dnf).  I really need to polish that and send it upstream.
Jul 27 14:15:31 <tibbs>	Could someone give me some advice about udev rules?  I'm working on the solaar package.  Upstream includes some udev rules, but Fedora doesn't use them.  Instead it relies on a separate package called unifying-receiver-udev, but solaar's rules are far more comprehensive.
Jul 27 14:16:31 <tibbs>	In fact, unifying-receiver-udev contains rules for only two devices so I really want to switch over to using the rules from solaar.
Jul 27 14:17:24 <tibbs>	The problem is that I don't really understand udev rules.  Could someone who knows look at https://github.com/pwr/Solaar/blob/master/rules.d/42-logitech-unify-permissions.rules and see if these rules are OK in Fedora?
Jul 27 14:21:01 <tibbs>	If I understand correctly, the only real difference in the solaar rules (after ignoring the control flow stuff) is that they will additionally apply TAG+"udev-acl" which only means something to old ubuntu releases.
Jul 27 15:24:43 <wwoods>	tibbs: what do you actually need to happen?
Jul 27 15:25:33 <tibbs>	wwoods: Well I assume the point of TAG+="uaccess" is to change permissions on the device nodes.
Jul 27 15:26:03 <tibbs>	What I need to happen is for the solaar tool to be able to access the devices to do whatever it needs to do.
Jul 27 15:26:45 <wwoods>	what permissions does it actually need to access the device(s)?
Jul 27 15:26:53 <tibbs>	The unifying-receiver-udev package works but it is far less comprehensive.
Jul 27 15:27:13 <tibbs>	It needs rw.
Jul 27 15:27:40 <wwoods>	to the best of my knowledge you can just drop the "udev-acl" tag there
Jul 27 15:28:00 <wwoods>	so line 47 can just read: TAG+="uaccess"
Jul 27 15:28:14 <tibbs>	Yeah, I've patched it out.
Jul 27 15:28:23 <wwoods>	other than that, that file looks fine
Jul 27 15:28:48 <tibbs>	The unifying-receiver-udev rules look like: KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="046d",ATTRS{idProduct}=="c52b",TAG+="uaccess"
Jul 27 15:29:15 <wwoods>	(the "uaccess" tag gets picked up by /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/70-uaccess.rules and off you go)
Jul 27 15:29:33 <wwoods>	so yeah this file def handles a lot more devices
Jul 27 15:29:41 <tibbs>	So one difference is that the solaar rules use ACTION != "add" or SUBSYSTEM != "hidraw" to skip the entire thing.
Jul 27 15:30:11 <tibbs>	Not sure what the difference between KERNEL=="hidraw*" and SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw" might be.
Jul 27 15:30:28 <adamw>	rdieter: cool, thanks
Jul 27 15:30:59 <wwoods>	yeah - instead of applying the tag if KERNEL=="hidraw" it skips the tag if it's not hidraw. basically equivalent
Jul 27 15:31:35 <tibbs>	Ah, using udevadm I see KERNEL=="hidraw0" and SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw" so that makes sense.
Jul 27 15:32:25 <tibbs>	The other thing the solaar rules do match on DRIVERS to avoid doing anything with the peripherals actually paired to the receivers, which seems to make sense.
Jul 27 15:32:56 <wwoods>	yeah, the latter match is probably trivially faster and the solaar rule file is definitely more flexible and more precies
Jul 27 15:32:59 <wwoods>	precies
Jul 27 15:33:09 <wwoods>	hi, I have a new keyboard and I'm not quite used to it yet
Jul 27 15:33:11 <wwoods>	preccise
Jul 27 15:33:13 <tibbs>	So anyway, I've subpackaged the solaar rules (into solaar-udev) and will depend on them instead.  I suppose solaar-udev could simply provides/obsolete.
Jul 27 15:33:19 *	wwoods dies
Jul 27 15:33:43 <tibbs>	If both of these rules files were installed, the end result would be... no change, right?
Jul 27 15:34:04 <tibbs>	They both just add the uaccess tag, and nothing cares if the tag is there more than once.
Jul 27 15:35:04 <wwoods>	as I understand things, yes
Jul 27 15:35:22 <tibbs>	Still, I'll probably obsoletes/provides anyway to avoid that situation.
Jul 27 15:44:42 <tibbs>	wwoods: If you're still around, I was wondering about the sanity of running udevadm trigger in %post for packages that install rules.
Jul 27 15:45:42 <tibbs>	File triggers exist so that there is no reason to run udevadm control --reload, but I assume that there's a good reason that those don't udevadm trigger.
Jul 27 15:45:59 <tibbs>	But without it, you have to hotplug the devices or reboot before the rules take effect.
Jul 27 15:46:03 <wwoods>	:<
Jul 27 15:46:36 <tibbs>	And some packages do call udevadm trigger in scriptlets.
Jul 27 15:46:44 <wwoods>	yeah _ideally_ there would be a %posttrans that does a trigger for any devices that match newly-installed rules
Jul 27 15:46:54 <wwoods>	some packages do a lot of terrible things in scriptlets
Jul 27 15:47:43 <tibbs>	I mean, modifying the existing %transfiletriggerin that systemd-udev has would be easy.
Jul 27 15:48:00 <tibbs>	But I assume there's a good reason that it isn't done.
Jul 27 15:48:18 <tibbs>	I just don't have any real understanding of what it might be.
Jul 27 15:48:26 <wwoods>	yeah I mean, just because there's new rules doesn't mean all of them need triggered
Jul 27 15:48:56 <tibbs>	But installing new rules isn't something that happens all that often.
Jul 27 15:49:33 <tibbs>	The trigger scriptlets are told (on stdin) exactly which files changed.
Jul 27 15:49:47 <wwoods>	sure, but it happens, and if we're handling things Correctly rather than Whatever Is Simplest For Developers then you'll want to do a trigger for any device that matches a modified rule
Jul 27 15:50:12 <tibbs>	But I don't know if there's any operation that would just trigger on devices referenced in a rule file.
Jul 27 15:50:23 <wwoods>	it *might* be okay to just do a big ol coldplug trigger but I'm no authority
Jul 27 15:50:37 <tibbs>	I wonder who the authority would be.
Jul 27 15:51:06 <tibbs>	Because this is a rather unfortunate hole in our packaging guidelines; we don't talk about udev rules at all, and people keep asking about it.
Jul 27 15:51:27 <tibbs>	And I'd write the guidelines if I knew enough to do so.
Jul 27 15:51:35 <wwoods>	correct behavior on upgrades is always a big ol' problem
Jul 27 15:52:36 <tibbs>	bluez does "udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=usb".
Jul 27 15:52:49 <tibbs>	minipro does udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=usb --attr-match=idVendor=04d8 --attr-match=idProduct=e11c
Jul 27 15:53:14 <tibbs>	NetworkManager matches on "net" and ovitr-guest-agent matches in "virtio-ports".
Jul 27 15:53:24 <tibbs>	udisks2 just does a bare "udevadm trigger".
Jul 27 15:53:30 <tibbs>	wireshark matches on usbmon.
Jul 27 15:53:34 <tibbs>	I think that's the lot.
Jul 27 15:53:52 <walters>	FWIW since https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/pull/1099 udev can't affect the running system on rpm-ostree managed systems; though it looks like it just exits `0` if run without privileges
Jul 27 15:55:09 <tibbs>	If we had a convention that rules files included a string near the top, systemd-udev's transfiletriggerin script could just do the right thing with that file.
Jul 27 15:55:26 <walters>	IOW it will consistently do nothing until you reboot, then all devices are either handled or not by the new rules
Jul 27 15:56:00 <tibbs>	There was talk of doing the same kind of thing with unit files so that we could entirely eliminate the scriptlets for starting and restarting services.
Jul 27 15:56:22 <tibbs>	It's so trivial to implement but I have no idea what happened to it.
Jul 27 15:57:01 <wwoods>	I'm not sure who the official/best point of contact should/would be there but you could probably ask, uh.. hey haraldh is here, maybe he has ideas :D
Jul 27 15:57:45 <tibbs>	Probably in Europe and enjoying his Friday evening.
Jul 27 15:58:17 <halfline>	kay is the resident udev expert
Jul 27 15:58:32 <wwoods>	halfline: does he idle here? I don't know his IRC nick
Jul 27 15:58:35 <halfline>	also probalby in europse enjoying his friday
Jul 27 15:58:47 <halfline>	i think he ditched irc a few years ago

Jul 30 09:06:09 <Son_Goku>	mizdebsk, ignatenkobrain tells me you have a fancy ansible playbook that sets up working koji systems
Jul 30 09:06:14 <Son_Goku>	would you mind sharing?
Jul 30 09:06:15 <mizdebsk>	hi Son_Goku
Jul 30 09:07:01 <mizdebsk>	i'd need to review it (it contains hardcoded passwords etc)
Jul 30 09:07:42 <mizdebsk>	Son_Goku, you are aware that fedora infra has playbooks for koji too?
Jul 30 09:08:05 <Son_Goku>	yes, but afaik, they're wired into how the infra stuff works
Jul 30 09:08:46 <mizdebsk>	right
Jul 30 09:09:02 <Son_Goku>	mizdebsk, my objective is to get a koji instance set up for building Mageia packages for https://wiki.mageia.org/en/Feature:Migrate_to_Koji
Jul 30 09:19:08 <raveit65>	mclasen, hi, is there a chance to add this upstream commit to gtk3 build for fedora ? https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/commit/c8b0a0dea5cd129d8e023443dde5e44319d4631d
Jul 30 09:20:27 <raveit65>	This will fix this annoying issue that we we have wit HIDPI monitor resolutions https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-panel/issues/818#issuecomment-404871114
Jul 30 09:21:08 <raveit65>	Or is there a plan to release gtk+-3.22.31 ?
Jul 30 09:22:39 <mclasen>	raveit65: no further 3.22 releases. 3.24 is the continuation of 3.22
Jul 30 09:23:02 <raveit65>	Of course i can open a report for this issue
Jul 30 09:23:22 <mclasen>	https://blog.gtk.org/2018/06/23/a-gtk-3-update/
Jul 30 09:23:57 <mclasen>	I'm not eager to cherry-pick individual commits. we should just get the 3.23 releases info fedora
Jul 30 09:24:04 <mclasen>	they are stable for all practical purposes
Jul 30 09:24:41 <raveit65>	ok, for f28 and f27?
Jul 30 09:26:14 <mizdebsk>	Son_Goku, https://mizdebsk.fedorapeople.org/tmp/koji.tar.xz
Jul 30 09:26:17 <raveit65>	mclasen, well, fixing f28 with gtk+-3.23/24 would be great
Jul 30 09:26:28 <mizdebsk>	this is a simple playbook i used to set up koji at https://koji.kjnet.xyz/
Jul 30 09:26:46 <mizdebsk>	(it's running on aws ec2)
Jul 30 09:27:42 <mclasen>	raveit65: should be fine to put it into all active fedora streams
Jul 30 09:28:53 <raveit65>	mclasen, \o/ thank you, this issue is a really shostopper and several peoplrle did report it
Jul 30 09:29:18 <raveit65>	showstopper with HIDPI

Jul 30 13:55:03 <jaroslav>	gicmo: it's still on the same pid, and apart of those `get-updates transaction...` messages, there's nothing else from comming from PackageKit
Jul 30 13:55:15 <gicmo>	maybe some client (gnome-software) is requesting stuff? have you checked dbus-monitor ?
Jul 30 13:57:40 <jaroslav>	gicmo: don't see anything suspicious there
Jul 30 14:00:51 <jaroslav>	that's probably not the correct way, but I've just removed PackageKit, [case_solved]
Jul 30 14:35:21 <ajax>	i like how multilib is almost 20 years old and all of our tools and services are still routinely surprised by it
Jul 30 14:36:08 <ajax>	hey, you're trying to install just the 64-bit version of some libraries and you need to do the 32-bit ones too! here's fifty pages of scroll about all the conflicts.
Jul 30 14:36:46 <ajax>	hey, here's a service that lets you build test packages and host a repository for them! no it doesn't have all arches in the repo, why would you want it to work.
Jul 30 14:53:22 <pjones>	multilib: still a terrible idea
Jul 30 14:54:01 <ajax>	psht
Jul 30 14:54:12 <ajax>	"run whatever binary you've got" is an excellent idea
Jul 30 14:54:28 <ajax>	and we built a system that makes that work
Jul 30 14:54:49 <ajax>	we just decided to make it completely impossible to keep it working or understand it when you ask it to make a move that would break it
Jul 30 14:55:19 <ajax>	and then refuse to fix it because "the repo data would be too big" for your three package copr
Jul 30 15:52:46 <walters>	where is the tarball of specs again?  it's impossible to google search for, and it's apparently moved since I linked to it in http://lists.rpm.org/pipermail/rpm-ecosystem/2017-May/000480.html

Jul 30 20:04:10 <dbenoit>	what is the best way to have a symlink between two files in the buildroot?  should I use the real path of the target? for example:
Jul 30 20:05:27 <dbenoit>	ln -s %{_bindir}/my-file ${RPM_BUILD_ROOT}%{_bindir}/my-file-legacy-alias
Jul 30 20:05:40 <dbenoit>	^^is this ok?
Jul 30 20:17:27 <tmz>	dbenoit: That works.  Or just ln -s my-file ${RPM_BUILD_ROOT}%{_bindir}/my-file-legacy-alias since both files are in %{_bindir}.
Jul 30 20:17:52 <tmz>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Symlinks discusses the pros and cons of absolute versus relative symlinks.
Jul 30 20:19:11 <tmz>	The cons for a relative link like this aren't really relevant, since the file and the link are in the same dir.
Jul 30 21:22:47 <QuLogic>	bodhi emails sure are slow lately
Jul 31 04:32:15 <timothy>	hi, is there any way to have subdirectories processed by find-debuginfo? I have /usr/lib64/SUBDIRECTORY/*.so.*, but in the debuginfo package I don't have the split symbols for those files
Jul 31 04:34:04 <ignatenkobrain>	timothy: can you open an issue for rpm with all details?
Jul 31 04:34:14 <ignatenkobrain>	And your srpm as well
Jul 31 04:39:51 <tomhughes>	timothy: it does process all files, but it will only process files with exec permissions - my guess is those .so's are marked as executables
Jul 31 04:39:56 <tomhughes>	aren't
Jul 31 04:40:24 <tomhughes>	note that so's don't really need x perms but Fedora has traditionally marked them as such and find-debuginfo ignores files without
Jul 31 04:47:49 <timothy>	tomhughes: you are right, it was a bug in the upstream makefile that uses -s while building the files inside the subdirectory. sorry for the noise

Jul 31 08:01:59 <misc>	kushal: do not seems so
Jul 31 08:22:36 <kushal>	misc, Yup, thanks for confirming.
Jul 31 08:23:34 <kushal>	misc, I am trying to figure out how to verify png images, just in case if there is any malware etc hidden inside of the image.
Jul 31 08:25:17 <misc>	kushal: imagemagick + a sandbox ?
Jul 31 08:26:27 <misc>	(especially the sandbox part)
Jul 31 08:26:54 <kushal>	misc, I am using the container as the sandbox, and already using imagemagick, but, I was told what if there is other known vulnerabilities  targeting imagemagick.
Jul 31 08:26:58 <misc>	something like convert to bitmap and back, without compression
Jul 31 08:27:08 <misc>	kushal: that's why you have the sandbox
Jul 31 08:27:10 <kushal>	misc, Yup, that is what I am thinking to do.
Jul 31 08:27:25 <misc>	a timeboxed execution, no network, no syscall
Jul 31 08:27:35 <misc>	and also ressources limitation
Jul 31 08:27:38 <jsmith>	Anybody else having problems with the "rpmdev-bumpspec" tool?  When I bump the version number, it's throwing and error and duplicating the version and revision twice.
Jul 31 08:27:53 <kushal>	jsmith, ah, good morning there :)
Jul 31 08:28:01 <kushal>	misc, Yup, exactly that.
Jul 31 08:28:06 <jsmith>	Howdy kushal :-)
Jul 31 08:28:12 <misc>	kushal: now, the what if could be the same for pngcheck
Jul 31 08:28:26 <kushal>	misc, yeah, that is also going on my mind.
Jul 31 08:28:30 <kushal>	misc, pm?
Jul 31 08:28:34 <misc>	kushal: sure
Jul 31 08:28:41 <jsmith>	kushal: Just a word of advice, I'd use "graphicsmagick" over "imagemagick" any day... more security items fixed, is faster (as it runs across multiple cores), etc.
Jul 31 08:29:09 <kushal>	jsmith, checking
Jul 31 09:27:14 <rishi>	rpm --requires -q liboauth | grep ss <-- I get libnss3.so and libssl3.so
Jul 31 09:27:20 <rishi>	How's that possible?
Jul 31 09:28:31 <rishi>	Oh, ok.
Jul 31 09:28:47 <rishi>	libssl3.so is from NSS. I somehow thought it's OpenSSL.
Jul 31 09:28:55 <rishi>	All good. :)
Jul 31 11:35:32 <tibbs>	Ugh; znc updated again and broke znc-clientbuffer.
Jul 31 11:35:53 <tibbs>	I think I will fix znc-clientbuffer to depend on the specific version of znc.
Jul 31 11:53:01 <nb>	tibbs, sorry! I need to remember to rebuild znc-clientbuffer when I update znc
Jul 31 11:55:58 <tibbs>	I just made znc-clientbuffer depend on znc by version, so it just won't update if they're out of date.
Jul 31 11:56:21 <tibbs>	I'll push that out for f28 and f27.
Jul 31 11:56:51 <tibbs>	%global znc_version %((znc -v 2>/dev/null || echo 'a 0') | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')

Jul 31 12:07:08 <gholms>	tibbs: That'll need a buildroot override to make updates not break things
Jul 31 12:07:33 <tibbs>	gholms: Sorry, I don't see why.
Jul 31 12:07:53 <tibbs>	znc is already updated to 1.7.1, so things are already broken.
Jul 31 12:08:28 <gholms>	If znc updates in the future it will need to have a buildroot override in order for znc-clientbuffer to rebuild with it.
Jul 31 12:08:30 <tibbs>	If you mean in the future, then yes.
Jul 31 12:08:36 <gholms>	Yeah, not today.
Jul 31 12:08:48 <tibbs>	But that's how this always works.  Needing an override for that is neither new nor surprising.

Jul 31 12:22:14 <zodbot>	RaphGro: Bug 1610331 – xfce-polkit-v0.3 is available - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1610331
Jul 31 12:22:33 <RaphGro>	nirik: from the chanelog "Switch to gtk3", no idea if gtk2 is still supported.
Jul 31 12:22:59 *	ajax sets quiet on $~a
Jul 31 12:23:26 <ajax>	momentary hush of unregistered nicks since apparently it's spam day again
Jul 31 12:23:35 <nirik>	RaphGro: yes, we should wait and do this when nonamedotc does the rest of the 4.13 ones.
Jul 31 12:23:46 <RaphGro>	nirik: ok.
Jul 31 12:24:20 <RaphGro>	nirik: is there a tracker bug?
Jul 31 12:24:39 <nirik>	not yet, waiting for the change to be approved.
Jul 31 12:25:09 <RaphGro>	ok
Jul 31 12:27:01 <fenrus02>	ajax, is it worth updating the /topic with something like "if you cannot say anything, register your nick?"
Jul 31 12:27:31 <ajax>	probably
Jul 31 12:28:34 *	ajax has changed the topic to: Unregistered nicks are muted, blame spammers. '/msg nickserv help' for instructions to register your nick | Fedora developers channel | end users: please ask for help in #fedora | Infra status http://status.fedoraproject.org/
Jul 31 12:28:52 <ajax>	dropped the bit about s390x being primary "now", it's sort of not news anymore
Jul 31 12:29:05 <gholms>	Heh
Jul 31 12:29:15 <tibbs>	Yeah, I was asking about that some time ago but I never know who has ops here.
Jul 31 12:29:27 <fenrus02>	that works.
Jul 31 12:29:59 <gholms>	My standby for that sort of thing is usually "just ask nirik"
Jul 31 12:30:12 <ajax>	tibbs: /m chanserv access #fedora-devel list
Jul 31 12:30:30 <ajax>	the 'o' flag means has ops, iirc
Jul 31 12:30:34 <tibbs>	There is a small chance I will remember that the next time it actually matters.
Jul 31 12:30:37 <ajax>	heh
Jul 31 12:30:43 *	nirik waves
Jul 31 12:30:49 <tibbs>	At least now it will be in my logs.
Jul 31 12:31:23 <fenrus02>	tibbs, you can ask in -ops too.
Jul 31 12:33:36 <fenrus02>	sadly that variant of spammer is joining channels and then PM'ing users with the same drivel.  so it hits users even if the channel is muted for unreg.
Jul 31 12:36:49 <gholms>	If that becomes a problem mode +R will block PMs from unregistered users.
Jul 31 12:39:25 <fenrus02>	sure, that certainly works.  per user.
Jul 31 12:39:52 <gholms>	Not much else one can do without handling this particular spammer specifically  :/
Jul 31 14:13:28 <nb>	nirik, tibbs ping
Jul 31 14:13:33 *	nb has a packaging question
Jul 31 14:14:21 <nb>	so, upstream asked us why certbot-renew systemd timer isn't enabled by default
Jul 31 14:14:47 <nb>	i was looking at the policy and i think it would meet the guidelines of the policy, with one part that i'm ot sure about
Jul 31 14:15:22 <nb>	the part about not listening on network sockets..... when certbot-renew timer runs, if it needs to renew a cert that was obtained with --standalone, it will temporarily listen during the verification process then will stop again
Jul 31 14:15:29 <nb>	would that violate that criteria from the guidelines?
Jul 31 14:15:45 <nb>	if --webroot or dns or something else was used, i think it would meet the criteria on the guidelines
Jul 31 14:15:56 <tibbs>	Don't you have to configure it or something?
Jul 31 14:16:25 <nb>	tibbs, certbot-renew will work just fine even if there are not certs configured
Jul 31 14:16:40 <nb>	it just tries to renew any certs that are more than 2/3 through their validity period
Jul 31 14:16:55 <Elyscape>	yeah, by default, it doesn't do anything. if you've configured any certs, it'll perform whatever actions are necessary to renew them, which may include listening on a network socket
Jul 31 14:17:42 <tibbs>	I mean, I wouldn't turn it on just because you have the package installed.
Jul 31 14:18:17 <tibbs>	But I don't really know what to tell you.  I don't know how listening on a network socket could even work in general.  What if you're behind NAT or something?
Jul 31 14:18:38 <Elyscape>	if you're using that validation method, you'll have already configured that stuff
Jul 31 14:19:13 <Elyscape>	there are several validation methods and the only one that requires listening on a network socket is not recommended for most deployments
Jul 31 14:19:27 <nb>	tibbs, we are asking if the guidelines would allow us to turn certbot-renew on by default
Jul 31 14:19:47 <Elyscape>	but also it remembers the validation method you used for a given cert, so it'll only listen on a network socket if you told it to before, in which case you'd have already figured out NAT port forwarding or whatever
Jul 31 14:20:02 <nb>	from reading the criteria on the services page it looks like it would be ok, as long as the user didn't use --standalone which makes it listen on a socket during validation
Jul 31 14:20:12 <tibbs>	So if you have to configure before it is useful, then I guess I don't understand the question.  Running systemctl enable would be part of that configuration.
Jul 31 14:21:12 <Elyscape>	it still starts properly, it just doesn't do anything until you've configured it. the thing is, configuring it is generally done by running a command, rather than editing config files
Jul 31 14:22:33 <Elyscape>	my reasoning for turning on the timer by default is this: generally, if you're installing certbot, you want it to manage your certs, which includes renewing them. having the timer enabled by default simplifies that
Jul 31 14:22:49 <tibbs>	You have no idea why anyone installed the package.
Jul 31 14:22:55 <tibbs>	Maybe they wanted to look at the documentation?
Jul 31 14:23:55 <Elyscape>	well the good news there is that we aren't currently building the documentation, and when we fix that it'll be in a separate package
Jul 31 14:24:29 <d9k>	please do not turn anything by default if it is not completely necessary
Jul 31 14:25:06 <tibbs>	d9k: Well, that view doesn't agree with what Fedora currently wants.
Jul 31 14:26:15 <nb>	i'm kind of indifferent
Jul 31 14:26:20 <tibbs>	So, if I understand everything correctly and you really don't violate the four MUSTs listed on https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:DefaultServices then I think you wouldn't be in violation.
Jul 31 14:26:25 <Elyscape>	the certbot package itself (as compared to the python-certbot packages) only provides the binary commands and the systemd units
Jul 31 14:26:43 <nb>	personally i don't know that i would expect for it to renew stuff atuomatically, but i don't think it would be bad if it does do so
Jul 31 14:27:12 <tibbs>	I still wouldn't turn it on personally since setup is required before it's actually useful, and a quick 'systemctl enable' should just be part of that setup.
Jul 31 14:27:50 <tibbs>	But it seems like the worst thing that would happen is maybe some log pollution by this thing running forever and not doing anything.
Jul 31 14:28:24 <tibbs>	But if it spams the logs about not being configured or anything like that, then it certainly shouldn't be enabled.
Jul 31 14:30:29 <Elyscape>	without configuration, it logs a line saying "No renewals were attempted." once per run, which is scheduled to happen daily
Jul 31 14:38:34 *	gholms adds ``systemctl disable certbot-renew.service certbot-renew.timer'' to his kickstart templates just in case
Jul 31 14:39:21 <grift>	i think the `systemctl` is the easier part of the config, theres probably other low hanging fruit, although i have to say that certbot is pretty good state. but the assumption is that someone wants to renew automatically, and that it wants to try daily
Jul 31 14:40:00 <grift>	i suppose daily tries makes sense if you have a shedload of certs
Jul 31 14:40:14 <grift>	but if you have one then why try to renew everyday?
Jul 31 14:40:32 <gholms>	Ooh, actually, can kickstart service directives refer to systemd units other than .service ones?
Jul 31 14:49:16 <grift>	in other words the units are optional
Jul 31 15:07:40 <Elyscape>	grift: it doesn't actually try to renew daily. it runs `certbot renew` daily, which only actually attempts to renew a cert if the cert has only 1/3 of its life left
Jul 31 15:09:09 <grift>	yes ok, point i am trying to make is that its optional, one might be fine with running certbot manually
Jul 31 15:09:13 <Elyscape>	that's fair
Jul 31 15:10:23 <Elyscape>	FWIW, the reason upstream made the decision to recommend running daily in a timer unit or cron job is that certbot is designed to be a set-and-forget thing, and running daily lets that happen and also means that, if the renew process fails one day due to network conditions or something, it'll try again the next day
Jul 31 15:10:33 <Elyscape>	but that's sorta neither here nor there
Jul 31 15:10:48 <gholms>	That's exactly the reason one would enable it during installation
Jul 31 15:10:54 <gholms>	...or setup, rather
Jul 31 15:11:18 <grift>	i agree there
Jul 31 15:11:32 <RaphGro>	mbaldessari++ fix atomicwrites
Jul 31 15:11:32 <zodbot>	RaphGro: Karma for mbaldessari changed to 1 (for the current release cycle):  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/tags/cookie/any
Jul 31 15:11:58 <grift>	thats the easier part comparing to doing the post/pre renew scripts
Jul 31 15:12:47 <Elyscape>	totally fair
Jul 31 15:16:06 <grift>	you provided the units, that is already nice

Jul 31 17:13:59 <tibbs>	adamw: Python-requests-oauthlib is in EPEL.
Jul 31 17:14:13 <adamw>	tibbs: it isn't supposed to be for el7, though.
Jul 31 17:14:20 <adamw>	tibbs: i put it in an update and was told to take it out because it's in RHEL.
Jul 31 17:15:03 <adamw>	tibbs: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/python-mwclient-0.9.1-1.el7#comment-799349
Jul 31 17:15:40 <tibbs>	It's not blocked from epel7.
Jul 31 17:16:22 <tibbs>	And on a test machine I still get 0.4.0-7.el7 from EPEL.
Jul 31 17:17:14 <tibbs>	Where is this mythical python-requests-oauthlib-0.8.0-5.el7 supposed to come from? I only have CentOS.
Jul 31 17:20:02 <tibbs>	I'll ask in the EPEL channel.
Jul 31 17:20:20 <tibbs>	But it might be in one of the addon repositories and not in RHEL7 proper.
Jul 31 17:21:09 <adamw>	yeah, i think that was what it turned out to be. it's in one of the ones EPEL is not supposed to conflict with.
Jul 31 17:31:00 <tibbs>	But still, you wanted python2-requests-oauthlib?
Jul 31 17:31:50 <tibbs>	Because that's also already in centos/rhel7.
Jul 31 18:07:12 <tibbs>	If a PR can be merged "with a merge commit" in pagure, is that generally OK to do or do people dislike the merge commit?
Jul 31 18:08:38 <mizdebsk>	some people may not like it, but that's how git works; i don't know of any policy against merge commits in dist-git
Jul 31 18:09:05 <mizdebsk>	and i pushed many of them already
Jul 31 18:10:37 <tibbs>	Well I mean I could ask the submitter for a rebase, or just do the change manually.  But that seems like a lot of effort to avoid seeing a merge commit.
Jul 31 18:12:08 <tibbs>	Ah, well, I'll just merge it and see what happens.
Jul 31 18:18:02 <volter>	https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/6113/28746113/build.log -- That's not my fault, is it?
Jul 31 18:18:42 <tibbs>	What's not your fault?
Jul 31 18:18:47 <tibbs>	There's no error condition there.
Jul 31 18:19:04 <tibbs>	If your build failed, the cause is not shown in that file.
Jul 31 18:19:22 <tibbs>	No matching package to install: 'qscintilla-python2-devel'
Jul 31 18:19:39 <tibbs>	That's from root.log.
Jul 31 18:19:47 <volter>	Ah, OK, I somehow thought the build log would be empty then.
Jul 31 18:19:50 <volter>	Right, thanks!

Aug 01 09:36:52 <JohnKDEFC28>	anyone for an answer: There has been a lot of updates since F28 release, ie spectre, meltdown, microcode and a whole lot of GIGABYTES of KDE. Whre is the point release hybrid .ISO, so I can install it on a new machine? Shouldn't there be a daily builds like in Ubuntu? (cdimage daily builds for LTS).
Aug 01 09:37:21 <rdieter>	JohnKDEFC28: #fedora provides re-spins, look in /topic
Aug 01 09:38:01 <rdieter>	there are daily builds of development releases
Aug 01 09:38:14 <JohnKDEFC28>	I mean a point release with up to date packages on day 01.August.2018
Aug 01 09:39:40 <rdieter>	JohnKDEFC28: other priorities, lack of resources,time is the other excuse I suppose.  a daily item like that would miss any QA too, of course
Aug 01 09:40:10 <JohnKDEFC28>	So I will be pulling ALL GIGABYTES of updates?!
Aug 01 09:40:27 <rdieter>	JohnKDEFC28: alternatively, you're always welcome to use automated kickstart installs, which can install updates as part of the initial install process
Aug 01 09:40:58 <rdieter>	(I guess kickstart isn't necessarily automated, can be interactive too)
Aug 01 09:41:16 <rdieter>	so kickstart and/or network installs are an option for you too, if that's what you really want
Aug 01 09:41:26 <JohnKDEFC28>	Anyone is planning to automate the process of eg. weekly .iso releases for new installs? This is insane!
Aug 01 09:41:45 <pingou>	are you planning on doing it?
Aug 01 09:41:52 <rdieter>	I'm not aware of any plans.  Again, it's a matter or priorities and interest.
Aug 01 09:43:22 <JohnKDEFC28>	Can someone point at the next meeting of devs? Sorry for nagging, but Manjaro is looking at me right now! And I've been using Fedora, like.. since ever.
Aug 01 09:43:36 <rdieter>	based on this conversation, #fedora 's respins are the closest thing to what you want
Aug 01 09:44:05 <rdieter>	and I've offered other alternatives (like network installs that can pull in updates too)
Aug 01 09:44:55 <JohnKDEFC28>	but no POINT relese up to date on 01.August.2018 + it would be usefull to have live usb stick with updates of meldown and spectre an microcode and kernel and all other security packages just in case.
Aug 01 09:45:10 <rdieter>	JohnKDEFC28: it's not like this isn't a known issue (it's been discussed many times), but you're welcome to bring it up again on fedora -devel list
Aug 01 09:46:16 <rdieter>	JohnKDEFC28: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org/
Aug 01 09:46:57 <rdieter>	https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/live-respins/  these are relatively fresh, only ~1 week old
Aug 01 09:47:11 <JohnKDEFC28>	Devel don't care. Sorry, userbase for that will be dropping and that's needed for testing...stability. Thanks and over.
Aug 01 09:48:21 <rdieter>	nice attitude, suit yourself
Aug 01 09:52:10 <FranciscoD>	What's wrong with the re-spins?
Aug 01 09:52:13 <FranciscoD>	Oh well..
Aug 01 09:53:09 <rdieter>	he wants daily iso's, and wants them *now*, or else you don't care.  apparently
Aug 01 09:54:19 <sdgathman>	I'm about to add my first git submodule.  Is pointing to clone on the same machine goo practice?  Or should it point to a remote repo?
Aug 01 09:54:22 <FranciscoD>	Yeh, 'twas more a rant than a discussion
Aug 01 09:55:27 <sdgathman>	rdieter: aren't there instructions for building your own iso?
Aug 01 09:56:06 <sdgathman>	A link to that would be a good thing to give people who want it yesterday.
Aug 01 09:56:37 <rdieter>	pretty sure that information is included with the respins
Aug 01 10:01:18 <gholms>	Last time I tried our published instructions they were years out of date, but that was also a while ago
Aug 01 10:01:48 <gholms>	sdgathman: If you plan on pushing it somewhere for others to use it should point somewhere they can access.
Aug 01 10:11:11 <sdgathman>	gholms: the man page says submodules are read only (no edits)
Aug 01 10:19:43 <gholms>	sdgathman: Sure, but people still need to be able to fetch what they point to
Aug 01 10:20:21 <sdgathman>	So, I already have the submodule checked out to work on in a parallel directory.
Aug 01 10:21:20 <sdgathman>	So I thought edit would take place there, and projects including it as a submodule would just point to the local clone.  But as I said, it's my first git submodule.
Aug 01 10:23:51 <gholms>	A submodule has a pointer to a commit where it wpuld normally have a pointer to a directory tree.  When it sees that it will want to check out in-place.
Aug 01 10:25:01 <gholms>	The workflow for managing that is more or less "cd into submodule, make whatever changes are needed, cd back out, and commit the change to what commit the submodule points to."
Aug 01 10:25:53 <gholms>	I suggest doing some more reading on how that all works if you can.  It is neither obvious nor easy.
Aug 01 10:31:52 *	sdgathman starts leaning toward including a tarball instead...

Oct 16 11:19:47 <nim>	sgallagh, github renamings suck, sure they keep the old url working, but any download you do via the old url will give you the new name inside the generated tar.gzs
Oct 16 11:20:07 <nim>	sgallagh, including for releases that antedate the renaming
Oct 16 11:20:07 <sgallagh>	nim: Not an issue in this particular case.
Oct 16 11:20:31 <nim>	sgallagh, ok, good for you then !
Oct 16 11:20:37 <sgallagh>	:)
Oct 16 11:20:58 <simo>	nim: using github tarballs is alays a bad idea, as they make them anew every time their cache expires, so they are never really stable (you can't mdsum them)
Oct 16 11:21:38 <nim>	simo, don't really have a choice nowadays as many projects do not cut standalone release archives
Oct 16 11:21:47 <simo>	nim: yeah lots of lazy people
Oct 16 11:21:49 <nim>	simo, when they bother to release at all
Oct 16 11:22:02 <simo>	also the taballs are a git archive, not a make distcheck, which is also bad :/
Oct 16 11:22:15 *	sgallagh always uploads a proper tarball as a release, thankyouverymuch
Oct 16 11:22:17 <nim>	simo, right now you can be happy if they even tag stable code states in some way
Oct 16 11:22:22 <simo>	sgallagh: I do the same
Oct 16 11:22:44 <simo>	nim: I simply chose to avoid those repositories if at all possible
Oct 16 11:23:11 <simo>	release hygiene is a big factor in deciding to use something
Oct 16 11:23:22 <nim>	simo, lucky you, all the new infra scene uses golang and such lazy practices
Oct 16 11:23:25 <simo>	no release hygine means no committment -> can disappear at any moment
Oct 16 11:23:44 <nim>	simo, hard to avoid containers, docker or kubernetes nowadays when doing infra stuff
Oct 16 11:23:58 <simo>	nim: golang is an area I just left, that kind of (un)discipline was part of my decision
Oct 16 11:24:44 <nim>	simo,  lucky you ++
Oct 16 11:25:30 <nim>	sgallagh, & simo: you are a disappearing specie
Oct 16 11:26:03 <simo>	nim: or maybe the current draft is an ephemeral phenomenon, and they will simply re-learn all lessons the hard way as usual ..
Oct 16 11:26:04 <nim>	good release hygiene extinction event nowadays
Oct 16 11:26:43 <nim>	simo, it will take them years, and even those who learn won't bother fixing all their past errors
Oct 16 11:27:32 <simo>	nim: they'll just stop supporting those repos, I see this happening already
Oct 16 11:27:48 <simo>	golang has an alarmin rate of abandonment in my experience
Oct 16 11:28:27 <nim>	can’t say I disagree
Oct 16 11:28:30 <simo>	otoh given all easy things have like half a dozen (re)implementations it is natural most of them die a quick death
Oct 16 11:29:16 <nim>	huge strain to adapt fedora packaging to projects that sprout and die continuously
Oct 16 11:29:33 <simo>	nim: just don't package them :-)
Oct 16 11:30:27 <nim>	like I said, they have abysmal release hygiene, but they code stuff people need, and that has no alternatives right now
Oct 16 11:30:49 <nim>	so Fedora nees to adapt to them to stay relevant infra-side
Oct 16 11:31:12 <nim>	trying to "fix" people just does not work in my experience
Oct 16 11:42:42 <han-solo>	hello guys
Oct 16 11:42:54 <han-solo>	could someone fix this ? https://id.fedoraproject.org/openid/Consent
Oct 16 11:43:38 <han-solo>	Thank you
Oct 16 11:43:54 <kwizart>	han-solo, can you report to pagure ipsilon thx ?
Oct 16 11:44:46 <kwizart>	han-solo, https://pagure.io/ipsilon
Oct 16 11:45:29 <kwizart>	han-solo, or even peter uiterwijk in #fedora-admin
Oct 16 11:45:52 <han-solo>	kwizart: Sure
Oct 16 11:48:51 <han-solo>	kwizart: done! # https://pagure.io/ipsilon/issue/310
Oct 16 11:57:36 <Mr_Doge>	tibbs, thank you for looking at it , i will making the changes you suggested
Oct 16 11:59:12 <Mr_Doge>	*will be
Oct 16 13:08:28 <mattdm>	tibbs: Working on the antora packaging problem https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/issues/264#note_109274575
Oct 16 13:11:49 <jsmith>	mattdm: That's good news :-)
Oct 16 13:16:21 <nim>	ignatenkobrain, so I rebased PR35 with the new lua rpm dir created in the rpm you rebuilt today with Panu's changes
Oct 16 13:16:59 <nim>	ignatenkobrain, you can see it working in https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/nim/fontpackages-2/
Oct 16 13:18:14 <nim>	ignatenkobrain, specifically https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/nim/fontpackages-2/package/dejavu-fonts/ or https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/nim/fontpackages-2/package/ibm-plex-fonts/
Oct 16 13:18:39 <nim>	ignatenkobrain, the fonts macro bit actually reuse quite a lot of the lua code in pr35
Oct 16 13:19:04 <nim>	ignatenkobrain, I think I've finished nailing them down but they are not part of the PR
Oct 16 13:19:16 <nim>	ignatenkobrain, that will be a separate call
Oct 16 13:20:15 <nim>	ignatenkobrain, once you & tibbs have done pr35 and I've templated the font macro proposal a bit
Oct 16 13:21:54 <nim>	and of course the fonts bits depend on https://pagure.io/packaging-committee/issue/813 being arbitrated by FPC

Oct 17 14:53:05 <sergiodj>	hi there.  just trying to understand better the CI Gating thing.  IIUC, only a very specific set of tests can be enabled via the gating mechanism, right?
Oct 17 14:53:34 <sergiodj>	i.e., it's not possible to, e.g., run you project's own testsuite and enable gating based on its results
Oct 17 14:53:38 <sergiodj>	or is it?
Oct 17 14:54:48 <sergiodj>	a bit of background: I'm asking because I'm working on enabling gating for GDB
Oct 17 15:08:35 <misc>	usually, people do that with %check already, no ?
Oct 17 15:12:32 <mizdebsk>	sergiodj, it should be possible to run arbitrary tests from dist-git
Oct 17 15:13:57 <barc0d4>	is any one know how to fix lock_tlp on fedora ?
Oct 17 15:15:40 <sergiodj>	misc: yeah...  we already use %check for some regular testing, but I was wondering if the "trend" now is to use CI/gating
Oct 17 15:16:49 <sergiodj>	mizdebsk: could you point me to some documentation on how to do that, please?  I haven't been able to find anything really useful
Oct 17 15:17:02 <mizdebsk>	sure
Oct 17 15:17:09 <mizdebsk>	sergiodj, https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CI/Tests
Oct 17 15:18:16 <sergiodj>	mizdebsk: thanks; I was already on that page.  I guess a better question would be: "how to integrate these tests with the gating machinery?"
Oct 17 15:18:47 <mizdebsk>	sergiodj, gating is not yet enabled in fedora, so right now you can't
Oct 17 15:19:02 <mizdebsk>	ref: https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issue/7311
Oct 17 15:19:24 <sergiodj>	aha
Oct 17 15:19:34 <sergiodj>	mizdebsk: thanks, didn't know that
Oct 17 15:19:44 <sergiodj>	I'll keep an eye on this bug
Oct 17 15:32:56 <mizdebsk>	sergiodj, once gating is enabled you will be able to configure it in gating.yaml file as documented here, https://docs.pagure.org/greenwave/package-specific-policies.html

Oct 18 10:08:21 <han-solo>	carlwgeorge: Okay. I forgot to add the to the BuildRequires, but the issue persists
Oct 18 10:16:46 <Caterpillar>	mrunge: I will see you tomorrow at CERN :-)))
Oct 18 10:17:46 <carlwgeorge>	han-solo: run `spectool python-easysnmp.spec`.  does that display a pypi tarball url?
Oct 18 10:22:00 <han-solo>	carlwgeorge: let me check
Oct 18 10:22:30 <han-solo>	carlwgeorge: Yep. Source0: https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/source/e/easysnmp/easysnmp-0.2.5.tar.gz
Oct 18 10:22:58 <carlwgeorge>	so what problem are you having exactly?  it doesn't seem like it's %pypi_source.
Oct 18 10:23:04 <han-solo>	carlwgeorge: stupid question, but dos rpmbuild do any caching ? :/
Oct 18 10:23:22 <carlwgeorge>	not that i know of
Oct 18 10:23:52 <han-solo>	carlwgeorge: Okay. It's just it errors to : error: File /home/ec2-user/deps/easysnmp/easysnmp-0.2.5/build/bdist.linux-x86_64/rpm/SOURCES/easysnmp-0.2.5.tar.gz: No such file or directory
Oct 18 10:24:11 <han-solo>	which i think, it is looking for the Source
Oct 18 10:24:53 <han-solo>	and i have only one `Source` line defined
Oct 18 10:25:28 <carlwgeorge>	that's not a problem with %pypi_source, that's telling you that you haven't downloaded the source yet
Oct 18 10:25:45 <carlwgeorge>	run `spectool -R -g python-easysnmp.spec`
Oct 18 10:26:09 <carlwgeorge>	or leave of the `-R` flag to just download to your working directory
Oct 18 10:27:25 <carlwgeorge>	rpmbuild doesn't automatically download the source for you, it just expects the filename from the url to exist
Oct 18 10:40:45 <han-solo>	carlwgeorge: Okay
Oct 18 10:41:26 <han-solo>	carlwgeorge: it does downloads to my current working directory
Oct 18 10:42:31 <han-solo>	carlwgeorge: forgive me, i was under the impression that, that it will take from the source pointed from %pypi_source
Oct 18 10:42:35 <han-solo>	How stupid :/
Oct 18 10:45:16 <carlwgeorge>	this is discussed in https://rpm-guide.readthedocs.io.  i've mentioned this guide to you multiple times.  have you read it yet?
Oct 18 10:46:16 <han-solo>	er, sorry, i couldn't read it, and i was just fixing tests, nad making it work
Oct 18 10:46:28 <han-solo>	s/read it/read it all/
Oct 18 10:46:54 <han-solo>	i will defenitely read it now that i see
Oct 18 10:50:17 <carlwgeorge>	it's really good, maxamillion and others have put a lot of work into it
Oct 18 10:54:42 <carlwgeorge>	btw, it looks like the pypi tarball doesn't include the tests, so personally i would switch source0 to use https://github.com/kamakazikamikaze/easysnmp/archive/%{version}/%{srcname}-%{version}.tar.gz
Oct 18 10:55:20 <carlwgeorge>	that url structure is explained here https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:SourceURL#Git_Hosting_Services
Oct 18 10:55:39 <carlwgeorge>	specifically this section https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:SourceURL#Git_Tags
Oct 18 10:56:20 <han-solo>	carlwgeorge: Yeah, i have talked with the guy that created this, and he acknowledges that the tests are not consistent
Oct 18 10:57:12 <carlwgeorge>	that's not uncommon, most people that install it from pypi aren't running the tests
Oct 18 10:57:43 <han-solo>	carlwgeorge: Yeah, it is only for people cloning from master branch anyway
Oct 18 10:58:06 <carlwgeorge>	not just master, packagers routinely run the tests from a tag

Oct 19 13:45:27 <rindolf>	rdieter: an update - i have an .src.rpm that builds fine and is rpmlint clean, but : 1. i didnt try installing the binaries. 2. no mock test yet
Oct 19 14:10:15 <rindolf>	Pharaoh_Atem: perhaps there is a misconfig?
Oct 19 14:28:08 <rdieter>	rindolf: probably good enough for an initial package review

Oct 19 16:26:48 <nim>	Pharaoh_Atem, no pm_request in copr
Oct 19 16:27:00 <Pharaoh_Atem>	it won't work in koji either
Oct 19 16:27:16 <nim>	Pharaoh_Atem, then I'll fill a bug on koji too
Oct 19 16:27:58 <nim>	Pharaoh_Atem, at this point I don't care anymore if it requires fixing rpm, redhat-rpm-con,fig, copr koji or whatever
Oct 19 16:28:06 <Pharaoh_Atem>	haha
Oct 19 16:28:09 <nim>	Pharaoh_Atem, I just want it fixed and working
Oct 19 16:28:51 <nim>	Pharaoh_Atem, and people will say I just wrotye a few lines of rpm macros
Oct 19 16:31:07 <Pharaoh_Atem>	is it just me or is copr down?
Oct 19 16:32:12 <nim>	nope it was down for me too
Oct 19 16:32:22 <nim>	had to write the bug with saved urls
Oct 19 16:33:03 <nim>	it worked an hour ago
Oct 19 16:37:42 <nim>	Pharaoh_Atem, you've got mail #2
Oct 19 16:37:57 <nim>	Pharaoh_Atem, anywhere else I need to fill bugs?
Oct 19 16:38:19 <Pharaoh_Atem>	you're probably going to have to bug releng to allow it
Oct 19 16:40:16 <nim>	Pharaoh_Atem, sure no problem, Just another ticket to fill somewhere
Oct 19 16:40:33 <nim>	Pharaoh_Atem, where is the releng issue tracker nowadays?
Oct 19 16:44:10 <mizdebsk>	nim, you mean mock pm_request plugin? if yes then i'm curious what is your use for it
Oct 19 16:44:18 <mizdebsk>	copr is or was down due to switch maintenance
Oct 19 16:44:24 <mizdebsk>	releng tracker is at https://pagure.io/releng/
Oct 19 16:45:02 <nim>	Pharaoh_Atem, https://pagure.io/releng/issue/7878
Oct 19 16:45:21 <nim>	mizdebsk, bazically any "modern" language is a mess
Oct 19 16:45:41 <nim>	mizdebsk, though Go (golang) is messier than most
Oct 19 16:46:41 <nim>	mizdebsk, it's so bad that the Fedora Go maintainers had to write a code analysis tool to identify the actual deps of a bit of Go code
Oct 19 16:47:04 <mizdebsk>	i honestly doubt relengs will ever enable it
Oct 19 16:47:14 <nim>	mizdebsk, I'm currently wrapping up this engine (written @RH) in some macro code
Oct 19 16:47:14 <rindolf>	Pharaoh_Atem: hi
Oct 19 16:47:44 <nim>	mizdebsk, to translate the result of the analysis in fedora package names
Oct 19 16:47:50 <rindolf>	Pharaoh_Atem: my fedora 29 vm is in working cond now
Oct 19 16:47:51 <nim>	mizdebsk, so the workflow is
Oct 19 16:48:22 <rindolf>	Pharaoh_Atem: took me the whole day due to that f*^$%%##$##$# dnf bug
Oct 19 16:48:42 <nim>	mizdebsk, unpack in prep → analyse code to get the corresponding Fedora rpm names → use pm request to install those in the buildroot
Oct 19 16:48:57 <nim>	mizdebsk, there's no better alternative
Oct 19 16:49:19 <nim>	mizdebsk, as otherwise packagers just run the same code analysis out of band to generate spec files
Oct 19 16:49:48 <nim>	mizdebsk, and generated spec files are awful from a Fedora releng POW
Oct 19 16:50:11 <mizdebsk>	yeah, i see
Oct 19 16:50:16 <nim>	mizdebsk, since there's no easy way to distinguish what lines were generated
Oct 19 16:50:31 <nim>	mizdebsk, and what lines are a human packager intervention
Oct 19 16:51:15 <nim>	mizdebsk, so basically I need PM request to cleanly separate the thing the code analysis tool did from the things the packager did
Oct 19 16:51:20 <mizdebsk>	i generally split builderquires into 2 blocks - first one is generated, second is added by maintainer
Oct 19 16:51:44 <nim>	mizdebsk, also, to make sure the code anaysis that is run is the one checked and audited by Fedora and not something else
Oct 19 16:52:29 <nim>	mizdebsk, well that's about the same result, except there is no pre-generated block, it's done dynamically in the build roor
Oct 19 16:52:31 <nim>	root
Oct 19 16:53:09 <nim>	mizdebsk, and it also makes sure deps which are not needed anymore are removed
Oct 19 16:53:16 <mizdebsk>	yes, i know how pm_request works as i designed it
Oct 19 16:53:44 <nim>	mizdebsk, as humans tend to keep the generated block forever without checking if buildrequires still apply
Oct 19 16:54:05 <mizdebsk>	true; you update generated block only when there is a problem
Oct 19 16:54:29 <nim>	mizdebsk, so you kepp old deps which are no longer necessary
Oct 19 16:55:00 <nim>	mizdebsk, and the end result for an langage ecosystem that rewrites its deps every other month like golang is awful
Oct 19 16:55:21 <nim>	mizdebsk, so, that's why I need pm request
Oct 19 16:55:39 <nim>	mizdebsk, not enabling it just makes the whole situation worse
Oct 19 16:56:19 <mizdebsk>	if results of your analysis is included in build logs (as is done for java) then you could analyze outputs of scratch builds done by koschei to identify packages with outdated buildrequires
Oct 19 16:56:57 <mizdebsk>	i wanted to do this for java, but didn't have enough time for this
Oct 19 16:57:13 <nim>	mizdebsk, the
Oct 19 16:57:37 <nim>	mizdebsk, there are just too many deps involved Golang side for it to be workable
Oct 19 16:58:28 <nim>	mizdebsk, the Go maintainers have spent years trying to audit the state of the Go packages through out of band scipts they never managed to do it
Oct 19 16:59:01 <nim>	mizdebsk, the end result was just a pile of rotting generated spec files no one undertood or maintained
Oct 19 16:59:37 <nim>	mizdebsk, the mecanism I've prototyped for go is pretty transparent
Oct 19 16:59:51 <mizdebsk>	i agree that auto-buildrequires would be good to have, but i don't believe fedora will enable them any time soon
Oct 19 17:00:08 <nim>	mizdebsk, you see exactly in the build logs what was reuested from pm_request and when i nthe spec
Oct 19 17:00:38 <nim>	mizdebsk, if they want unbundled go software they will have to do it
Oct 19 17:01:51 <nim>	mizdebsk, if they prefer shipping bundled stuff no one has any idea where it comes from and what CVEs it includes like it is done right now
Oct 19 17:02:10 <nim>	mizdebsk, then they just need blocking pm request use
Oct 19 17:03:49 <rindolf>	https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1053390606758825984 - tweeted about it
Oct 19 17:04:14 <nim>	mizdebsk, we've past the point were anyone can pretend not doing pm request is constructive, we have the years of experience not doing it and the result it produced for fedora packages
Oct 19 17:07:15 <nim>	mizdebsk, also in case you didn't know, go does not use dynamic libraries
Oct 19 17:08:08 <nim>	mizdebsk, the end-result software needs to dep directly on every bit of code involved in its build
Oct 19 17:08:59 <nim>	mizdebsk, for complex software like docker or kubernetes that's score if not hundreds of deps to record in the spec file
Oct 19 17:17:12 <nim>	mizdebsk, anyway, in case I've not bored you to death yet, you cann see it all woring in https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/hglkYSWJAHd2YuGBX2XnsA
Oct 19 17:18:07 <nim>	mizdebsk, line 2493 the golist command written @rh by Fedora's Go maintainers computes the deps
Oct 19 17:18:19 <nim>	mizdebsk, and then pm_request makes it all work

Nov 23 10:34:32 <timothy>	hi, is there any reason to have java-1.8.0-openjdk as dependency of ant since ant can work with any java version?
Nov 23 10:37:52 <tomhughes>	is not a require, it's a recommend (on java-devel >= 1:1.8.0)
Nov 23 10:38:18 <tomhughes>	so while that might be the default way of satisfying it other versions should do so if installed
Nov 23 10:38:39 <timothy>	tomhughes: no, ant requires javapackages-tools that hard-requires java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless
Nov 23 10:38:45 <timothy>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/javapackages-tools/blob/master/f/javapackages-tools.spec#_59
Nov 23 10:38:50 <timothy>	but without a good reason imho
Nov 23 10:38:52 <tomhughes>	so it's not ant that's the problem then
Nov 23 10:38:58 <tomhughes>	it's javapackages-tools that is the problem
Nov 23 11:34:34 <mizdebsk>	timothy, the reason is that ant is tested only with jdk 8
Nov 23 11:34:56 <mizdebsk>	i don't have time to test it with all jdk, available in fedora and third-party
Nov 23 11:35:56 <mizdebsk>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Decouple_system_java_setting_from_java_command_setting
Nov 23 11:37:25 <mizdebsk>	users can change which jdk is used to run ant, but at their own risk
Nov 23 11:43:52 <timothy>	mizdebsk: thank you (btw oracle will deprecated java8 in a year, so I think we should move to java11 or 12 in the next fedora releases)
Nov 23 11:44:22 <mizdebsk>	timothy, i am planning to move to java 11 indeed
Nov 23 11:44:31 <mizdebsk>	as it's next lts release after 8
Nov 23 11:44:42 <timothy>	sure
Nov 23 15:22:28 <redi>	the f29 installation guide recommends 10gb for /
Nov 23 15:23:45 <redi>	my / is over 15gb, and that's with a separate partition for /var
Nov 23 15:24:25 <redi>	10gb seems outdated
Nov 23 15:54:53 <linuxplease>	redi, https://access.redhat.com/discussions/641923
Nov 23 15:55:42 <linuxplease>	and if you choose automatic partitioning it wont do that
Nov 23 15:56:34 <linuxplease>	my point was dont separate /var and /
Nov 23 16:30:30 <thm>	it's really easy to have ~16G in /
Nov 23 16:34:01 <thm>	btw, it seems dnf and PackageKit still have duplicate caches. this was discussed long time ago, but still is unsolved
Nov 23 17:18:28 <QuLogic>	if you have been upgrading from previous release, make sure to check package caches for old releases
Nov 23 17:18:40 <QuLogic>	I've cleaned several gigs from deleting those
Nov 23 17:19:22 <DrNick>	/ should probably be 40GB
