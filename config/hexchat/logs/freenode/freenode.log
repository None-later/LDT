Dec 07 01:16:44 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
Dec 07 01:16:44 *	- Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the

Dec 07 01:16:44 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
Dec 07 01:16:44 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.

Nov 01 04:09:59 *	- a pioneering french author known for novels such as Twenty
Nov 01 04:09:59 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
Nov 01 04:09:59 *	- Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the

Nov 01 04:09:59 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
Nov 01 04:09:59 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.

Nov 29 09:50:57 *	- VERNE, Jules (1828-1905). Born in Nantes, France, Verne was
Nov 29 09:50:57 *	- a pioneering french author known for novels such as Twenty
Nov 29 09:50:57 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
Nov 29 09:50:57 *	- Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the
Nov 29 09:50:57 *	- Father of science fiction, Verne wrote about concepts such as
Nov 29 09:50:57 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
Nov 29 09:50:57 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.
