Jul 26 05:47:29 <CustosL1men>	O
Jul 26 05:58:02 <mistria>	CustosL1men: do you know how to build this project without Eclipse?
Jul 26 06:11:05 <CustosL1men>	mistria, I guess I can hack something out with javac
Jul 26 06:12:34 <CustosL1men>	let me get a file tree
Jul 26 06:12:43 <mistria>	CustosL1men: Eclipse builds automatically, All you have to do is to set the right classpath
Jul 26 06:13:14 <CustosL1men>	mistria, where is the output of build ?
Jul 26 06:13:35 <mistria>	CustosL1men: classes are usually in the bin/ folder
Jul 26 06:14:20 <mistria>	CustosL1men: if you want the jar, you have to use File > Export > Jar File
Jul 26 06:15:25 <CustosL1men>	http://termbin.com/n2zc
Jul 26 06:19:42 <mistria>	CustosL1men: ok, and what are you trying to achieve exactly?
Jul 26 06:19:57 <CustosL1men>	mistria, I want to build jar
Jul 26 06:20:02 <CustosL1men>	mistria, but what you suggested did wokr
Jul 26 06:20:04 <CustosL1men>	mistria, but what you suggested did work
Jul 26 06:20:11 <CustosL1men>	export jar
Jul 26 06:49:32 <samuel_m>	mistria: thanks for the hint about reporting a bug yesterday, just did that: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=498487
Jul 26 08:39:25 <BadApe>	what is eclipse neon? is it just a new naming scheme?
Jul 26 08:47:37 <CustosL1men>	BadApe, neon is the version/release name
Jul 26 08:50:19 <BadApe>	no more releases like pluto, i guess maybe they ran out of names
Jul 26 09:28:27 <raddy>	Hello Everybody
Jul 26 09:28:41 <raddy>	This is not directly related to eclipse
Jul 26 09:29:02 <raddy>	But people who have experience in Java can try to help

Jul 26 11:45:43 <CustosL1men>	can I do non graphical install for eclipse ?
Jul 26 11:47:27 <mistria>	CustosL1men: Depends on what you want to do, Eclipse can be extended to load without UI, but it's not part of the default packages
Jul 26 11:48:01 <CustosL1men>	actually - I want to build eclipse stuff from command line
Jul 26 11:48:06 <strykerawb>	mistria,  PM
Jul 26 11:48:13 <CustosL1men>	so I downloaded eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz (neon version)
Jul 26 11:48:35 <CustosL1men>	but when I run ./eclipse-installer/eclipse-inst I get graphical installer
Jul 26 11:48:40 <CustosL1men>	I want non graphical installer
Jul 26 11:48:48 <CustosL1men>	or if I can have non installer based eclipse it will also be fine
Jul 26 11:50:24 <mistria>	CustosL1men: ok, those are packages. From http://eclipse.org/downloads, there's a small link behind the installer
Jul 26 11:50:35 <CustosL1men>	ok thanks
Jul 26 11:50:40 <mistria>	CustosL1men: you can directly download zip/tars
Jul 26 11:50:41 <CustosL1men>	let me give it a go
Jul 26 11:51:17 <mistria>	CustosL1men: if you're on a recent and developer friendly Linux distro such as Fedora, there a native packages available with dnf
Jul 26 11:51:21 <mistria>	or apt
Jul 26 11:51:26 <CustosL1men>	mistria, on gentoo
Jul 26 11:51:34 <CustosL1men>	mistria, there are native packages but I dont like them
Jul 26 11:51:49 <mistria>	CustosL1men: don't think there's something recent on Gentoo
Jul 26 12:12:57 <CustosL1men>	so this builds classes hnb eclipse-neon eclipse -nosplash -data "${HOME}/eclipse-workspace/" -application org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core.aptBuild
Jul 26 12:13:04 <CustosL1men>	but not sure how to get it to build jar
Jul 26 12:18:22 <mistria>	CustosL1men: you can try the antBuilder application, and pass an Ant build.xml file
Jul 26 12:20:35 <CustosL1men>	cant I somehow get maven to build eclipse projects ?
Jul 26 12:26:38 <mistria>	CustosL1men: what do you ,mean bu Eclipse projects? Eclipse plugins? or regular Java projects?
Jul 26 12:28:00 <CustosL1men>	mistria, regular java projects like this: http://termbin.com/wbut
Jul 26 12:29:28 <mistria>	CustosL1men: ok, so yes, they can be built with Maven. But this task is independent from the IDE. The IDE can help and will understand Maven, but once your project is Maven based, you simply build it with Maven, no need for the IDE to build.
Jul 26 12:30:15 <CustosL1men>	mistria, see - I just want a simple straight forward way to generate jars for like 20 projects like this from command line
Jul 26 12:30:37 <CustosL1men>	normally I use maven as base - but people who made these projects did not
Jul 26 12:30:53 <CustosL1men>	and I'm trying to figure out how to get this to build automatically for me to jars
Jul 26 12:33:18 <mistria>	CustosL1men: the best way is to migrate this project to Maven. You can automate Eclipse export with Ant, but it's a PITA to maintain such approach
Jul 26 12:34:58 <CustosL1men>	ok - let me see about adding pom.xml files
Jul 26 12:35:29 <CustosL1men>	thanks for help mistria - really means allot ;)
Jul 26 12:35:45 <CustosL1men>	I normally just use vim + maven
Jul 26 12:35:58 <CustosL1men>	so I'm a bit overwhelmed by this IDE stuff
Jul 26 12:46:27 <mistria>	CustosL1men: there's for sure a learning curve, but it's wrth iy
Jul 26 12:46:36 <mistria>	worth it
Jul 26 12:46:58 <dan>	Hi, I just wanted to know, howcome Eclipse does not support JavaFX by default? Is JavaFX considered "dead"?
Jul 26 12:47:00 <CustosL1men>	mistria, for me not really - vim > - but anyway - main challenge is to just get this stuff auto building from command line
Jul 26 12:49:23 <mistria>	CustosL1men: vim is for sure an awesome editor. But automated build, awesome completion, debug, instant error reporting... Even if typimg cam be slower, all the other tools make coding good things easier
Jul 26 12:49:49 <CustosL1men>	mistria, but IMO automated build just inside maven is not usefull
Jul 26 12:50:06 <CustosL1men>	instant error reporting is nice, and auto completion is nice - but not that nice that I ever miss it
Jul 26 12:50:18 <CustosL1men>	<CustosL1men> mistria, but IMO automated build just inside maven is not usefull < I mean just inside eclipse
Jul 26 12:50:39 <CustosL1men>	like I said normally I juse maven - and then for people who want to use eclipse its no problem - but other way round is serious issue IMO
Jul 26 12:50:57 <CustosL1men>	if I cant build something easily from command line its a failure
Jul 26 12:52:29 <mistria>	CustomL1men: I agree about build shouldn't require IDE
Jul 26 12:53:06 <mistria>	CustomL1men: however, the last versions of Maven support in Eclipse IDE sometimes have pretty good completion. Infering parameters and documentation.
Jul 26 13:48:06 <BadApe_>	hello, i see neon has gulp support
Jul 26 13:48:22 <BadApe_>	do i need to install something?
Jul 26 15:03:04 <cjoseph>	hi, I'm using eclipse mars on an HTML page and I see a little warning triangle in the editor next to an iframe tag...but there are no error/problems listed in the problem window
Jul 26 15:03:20 <cjoseph>	any ideas why this is happening?
Jul 26 15:46:08 <nitind>	cjoseph: Have you not yet saved it to disk and let the project build (assuming the validation builder is set on that project)?
Jul 26 15:47:09 <cjoseph>	@nitind: is saved to disk...I have never run build, as it's just static HTML
Jul 26 16:03:47 <nitind>	cjoseph: You can righ-click on the file and Validate from there...I think.
Jul 26 16:04:04 <nitind>	Otherwise it's not going to add anything to the Problems View.
Jul 26 16:08:54 <cjoseph>	oh, that did it
Jul 26 16:08:57 <cjoseph>	thanks

Jul 27 16:13:07 <Vauff>	hi, i'm having an issue with eclipse where the code detail hover window is black and cannot be read, this started happening on a new neon install on linux with an imported workspace from windows mars https://i.imgur.com/bcwHwWS.png
Jul 27 16:15:27 <jeen>	Vauff, that's a known problem with Eclipse on Linux, I've seen it happen as far back as Helios. Fix is to install gnome-color-chooser and there configure background/foreground colors for tooltips.
Jul 27 16:16:03 <jeen>	see http://askubuntu.com/questions/45001/how-to-fix-black-tooltips-in-eclipse
Jul 27 16:18:03 <Vauff>	do you know if that would work with cinnamon?
Jul 27 17:26:37 <Vauff>	jeen: i've got it up and running now, however it seems that eclipse doesn't listen to anything i do with the background colour, the foreground does change properly though
Jul 27 18:39:35 <chealer>	hi. When debugging, when a variable is selected in the Variables view and its value changes, it does not highlight in yellow (since it's highlighted as selected). is this a known issue?
Jul 27 22:38:15 <_44trent>	so i have some code, but it's all commented out by line...how do I uncomment them all
Jul 27 22:38:36 <_44trent>	i'm trying to use find and replace to get rid of it, btw
Jul 27 22:39:57 <_44trent>	i got rid of the comments that didn't have the line number in them but for example on line 233...it's like this at the start "/* 233 */"
Jul 27 22:40:11 <_44trent>	is there a way i could make it remove everything starting with /* and ending with /*?
Jul 27 22:45:17 <_44trent>	uhm, is anyone here?
Jul 27 22:49:07 <_44trent>	*tumbleweed*
Jul 27 22:55:33 <_44trent>	just highlighting the lines and doing control + shift + \ keeps the whitespaces and the numbers
Jul 27 22:56:23 <phroa>	the comments start and end on the same line, always?
Jul 27 23:04:19 <_44trent>	yeah
Jul 27 23:04:46 <phroa>	they are the only thing on a given line?
Jul 27 23:04:59 <_44trent>	well each line has the comment, and then the code

Jul 27 23:06:49 <phroa>	have you thought about telling jd-gui to not generate those
Jul 27 23:06:59 <_44trent>	uhm, no.
Jul 27 23:07:05 <_44trent>	that's a thing?
Jul 27 23:07:23 <phroa>	that's such an intrusive feature I have to assume you can turn it off
Jul 27 23:08:06 <_44trent>	yeah someone else had already messed with a little, they have a server that is still running alpha and he had to make a new authentication server...
Jul 27 23:08:19 <_44trent>	and they disabled the part that makes it download the game
Jul 27 23:11:05 <_44trent>	i mean, I could get the uncommented code from the unmodified launcher actually
Jul 27 23:11:09 *	_44trent facepalms
Jul 27 23:12:51 <_44trent>	yep the code is untouched except for those things, I did a diff check first
Jul 27 23:13:01 <_44trent>	should be able to just copy it back in
Jul 27 23:19:30 <_44trent>	weird, those comment things are happening with everything...
Jul 27 23:19:36 <_44trent>	is eclipse doing something?
Jul 28 00:46:33 <khlorghaal>	cdt doesnt appear to be passing any of my -l args http://hastebin.com/zawelinijo.tex i know the project settings are correct, but its not showing -lSDL2 anywhere in the output
Jul 28 00:49:56 <khlorghaal>	even if i manually put it in linker misc args it doesnt show up
Jul 28 05:50:09 <StephenS>	hey is it possible to have Insert Dependency in pom.xml when I do alt+space?
Jul 28 07:31:44 <rann>	Hi all, running Eclipse Neon since three days. Have an annoying bug that appears when trying to alter workingsets in Enterprise Explorer and/or Project Explorer. I get an error dialog that tells me that a certain icon in an obj16/ directory could not be found.
Jul 28 07:32:59 <rann>	This seems innocent enough, but two times already, after this error and after closing the IDE, Enterprise Explorer crashed due to workingsets.xml being in an invalid state (two workingsets with the same name it says and creates a modern art of ui elements in Enterprise Explorer)
Jul 28 08:03:34 <pandaadb>	Hi - I have set up a gradle project for scala. It builds fine and i can import it into eclipse, however every time I change anything the editor tells me evertthing is broken
Jul 28 08:56:36 <chealer>	my issue is already tracked in ticket #246733.
Jul 28 08:58:42 <chealer>	if someone has the necessary privilege, this should not be assigned to CDT.
Jul 28 11:52:21 <nitind>	rann: You should report which icon cant be found through ~bugzilla
Jul 28 11:52:21 <Arbalest>	Bugzilla is the bug tracking system used by Eclipse. Open new bug reports and/or enhancement requests https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi / Search for existing bugs and/or enhancement requests https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/query.cgi
Jul 28 11:56:12 <rann>	nitind: alrighty, will do
Jul 28 11:58:34 <rann>	nitind: This one is getting the same backtrace (new, unconfirmed: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=488618)
Jul 28 11:59:38 <rann>	And this one: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=465456
Jul 28 12:03:11 <rann>	heh, how appropriate: "This is a timebomb that shouldn't be left ticking without a target milestone."
Jul 28 15:33:41 <_44trent>	so i'm trying to modify an older minecraft launcher but I can't seem to start it with any run configuration
Jul 28 15:34:12 <_44trent>	iirc the main class is LauncherFrame...in net.minecraft.LauncherFrame...
Jul 28 15:34:20 <_44trent>	but it still won't start
Jul 28 15:35:47 <_44trent>	does anyone know how the heck I can launch it?
Jul 28 15:36:01 <nitind>	WHat have you already tried?
Jul 28 15:36:32 <_44trent>	well, I opened the run configurations and made a run configuration with it's main method being "net.minecraft.LauncherFrame"
Jul 28 15:36:34 <_44trent>	but it can't find that
Jul 28 15:36:55 <_44trent>	i try to do it from the parent directory as the launcher also needs LZMA stuff...
Jul 28 15:37:40 <_44trent>	manifest.mf in meta-inf does say the main class is "net.minecraft.LauncherFrame"
Jul 28 15:38:08 <_44trent>	http://hastebin.com/poyunarero.pas
Jul 28 15:38:12 <_44trent>	that's the manifest
Jul 28 15:38:30 <_44trent>	i don't see why it won't run at all, it doesn't find any methods at all, only the system ones
Jul 28 15:39:32 <_44trent>	do i need to set launcherframe.java as my main class or something?
Jul 28 15:40:03 <_44trent>	this is the directory structure of my project btw: https://vgy.me/s2WMTH
Jul 28 15:43:06 <_44trent>	i should have set that as my source folder probably

Jul 29 03:36:04 <Stummi>	Is there some way to hide warnings from generated source files?
Jul 29 05:41:15 <rann>	Stummi: Apparently this is a feature in the JDT plugin (so .java only) since 3.8: Project properties > Java Build Path > Compiler > Source, "Selectively ignore errors/warnings from source folders". The toggle is called "Ignore optional compile problems" and can be enabled on per-folder basis

Jul 30 12:10:26 <red-lichtie>	Hi, I've just installed the latest version of eclipse (neon) using the online installer. Now when I try to add another site I am getting the following error "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class sun.security.ssl.SSLSessionImpl"
Jul 30 12:11:48 <red-lichtie>	But the error is coming from within that class. Any ideas?
Jul 30 12:17:10 <red-lichtie>	I looks like it might be a nJVM problem
Jul 30 12:47:39 <red-lichtie>	I get the error using openjdk 8 but not with oracle, so using the "-vm" to force that one
Jul 30 17:02:58 <TheChubu>	hi! i have a question
Jul 30 17:03:12 <TheChubu>	does anybody knows where on earth i can get Eclipse launcher's icons?
Jul 30 17:03:35 <TheChubu>	afaik they do like some icons with a tiny "JEE" or "PHP" or whatever for each of the distributions
Jul 30 17:03:42 <TheChubu>	dunno where to find htem
Jul 30 22:27:01 <ecfuser71476>	Hello!
Jul 31 06:05:16 <eagles0513875_>	hey guys anyone here
Jul 31 06:07:03 <eagles0513875_>	i need some major help with exporting to a runnable jar file but for some reason im running it on the command line for testing purposes
Jul 31 06:07:18 <eagles0513875_>	and its like the jar file is not finding the java file with the class that has the main method
Jul 31 06:07:28 <eagles0513875_>	i check with java tvc on the jar file and i see the app.java file there
Jul 31 06:07:30 <eagles0513875_>	any ideas
Jul 31 06:07:56 <eagles0513875_>	running the main class from with in eclipse works fine no problem just jar file
Jul 31 09:00:56 <surial>	eagles0513875_: what exactly are you running? java -cp myjar.jar or java -jar myjar.jar? Also, separately, you should really be making these with maven, gradle, or ant, not eclipse.
Jul 31 10:11:30 <eagles0513875_>	surial: they are ant scripts im using eclipse and telling it to export everything to a runnable jar file
Jul 31 10:12:01 <eagles0513875_>	surial: thing is this was a single developer FOSS project and lead dev is stepping back. and im taking over so i am with out documentation on how things are if you like i can provide you a link to the repository.
Jul 31 10:15:38 <eagles0513875_>	surial: another issue is that this is 25 seperate projects and instead of creating an installer for each I want something which is a bit more portable
Jul 31 10:15:49 <eagles0513875_>	hence my wanting to use a runnable jar
Jul 31 11:07:16 <surial>	eagles0513875_: you should make this monolithic runnable jar with maven, gradle, or ant, and not eclipse.
Jul 31 11:07:31 <eagles0513875_>	how does one do that with ant
Jul 31 11:07:49 <eagles0513875_>	if ant scripts are spread across 25 different projects in eclipse
Jul 31 14:23:45 <Tase>	Installed jdk 1.8 x86, run eclisep-insta-win32.exe, does nothing
Jul 31 14:24:06 <Tase>	run eclipse-inst-win64.exe, shows missing 64bit jfk (as expected)
Jul 31 14:24:35 <Tase>	i went to the wiki for install instructions, but it forwards to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php?show_instructions=TRUE
Jul 31 14:24:39 <Tase>	which shows nothing
Jul 31 17:14:37 <flappynerd>	for the CDT (C++ Developer Tools) do I need the "C++ Developer Tools SDK" or is that only if I want to contribute to CDT itself?
Jul 31 19:42:56 <AlpTunga_>	Hello all
Jul 31 19:45:54 <AlpTunga_>	I had a problem about Eclipse Console doesn't get EOF (ctrl+d) as input and it was solved by updating it. It was eclipse-cpp-mars-R-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz. Something broke down and i was not able to launch it so i installed a new one from Ubuntu Software Center. Even though i updated it i still got the same problem.
Jul 31 20:05:59 <AlpTunga_>	Upgrading from previous Eclipse IDE package to Neon (4.6) is NOT supported https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_upgrade_Eclipse_IDE%3F
Jul 31 20:06:00 <AlpTunga_>	nvm.
Jul 31 20:09:56 <donald1>	I have just installed eclipse IDE with this tuto https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-java/installer-les-outils-de-developpement. I follow these instructions to setup a new project but at the selection of installed JRE after Window > Preferences I still do not see the bar situated under the name "package explorer". How to see this one to read my code on the right side and begin to code?
Jul 31 20:26:21 <davidmichaelkarr>	donald1: Sorry, but you'll have to be much more specific.  I have no idea what "do not see the bar" means. Also note that most people here will be english-speaking (and mostly not french-reading), so don't expect us to get much information from pages like that.
Jul 31 20:43:31 <donald1>	I have just installed eclipse IDE with this tuto https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-java/installer-les-outils-de-developpement. I follow these instructions to setup a new project but I can not create the left bar.
Jul 31 20:56:14 <upgrdman>	how do i attached a javadoc JAR for eclipse to see? im trying to use the Apache Commons Math library. i did the Add External JARs thing, and added the commons...jar and commons...javadoc.jar files. both are listed under Referenced Libraries. but Eclipse can't seem to see the javadoc when i hover over a method to try and see it's javadoc.
Aug 01 08:47:37 <carabia>	Question of Eclipse C/C++, when you write a function prototype, and later you define said function , is it possible for eclipse to auto-complete the parameters?
Aug 01 08:48:26 <carabia>	The way, e.g. visual studio does it, iirc
Aug 01 10:46:13 <RajRajRaj>	hi i am setting up eclipse cdt for existing code, that code required some environment variables to be set upfront in order to build it. how do i do it in eclipse build configuration.
Aug 01 14:46:38 <carabia>	I'll ask again, if anyone knows ~
Aug 01 14:46:43 <carabia>	Question of Eclipse C/C++, when you write a function prototype, and later you define said function , is it possible for eclipse to auto-complete the parameters?
Aug 01 15:41:01 <nitind>	So have you tried it, or having tried it, found it not to do that?
Aug 01 15:43:44 <themiddleman_>	Quick question, how can I access the project properties from a plugin
Aug 01 15:47:40 <nitind>	What do you mean?
Aug 01 15:48:55 <nitind>	themiddleman_: https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-core/documents/user_settings/faq.html#platformScopes and  http://help.eclipse.org/neon/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/ProjectScope.html ?
Aug 01 16:04:45 <davidmichaelkarr>	So I just tried to set up Tomcat 8.5.3 (in TomEE 7.0.1) in Eclipse, and apparently there is a long-standing required hack to the "ServerInfo.properties" file to fool Eclipse to knowing it's Tomcat 8.x. Seems strange this is still required.
Aug 01 16:09:05 <nitind>	Are you sure this doesn't fall under ~494936 ?
Aug 01 16:09:06 <Arbalest>	Bug 494936 - http://bugs.eclipse.org/494936 - WTP ServerTools / jst.server / 3.7 - All / All - NEW /  / normal / - Assignee: Larry.Isaacs - Add Tomcat 8.5 support to WTP Server Tools
Aug 01 16:11:35 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: Thanks.  Looks like that's it.  Not as long-standing as I thought.
Aug 01 16:12:30 <themiddleman_>	@nitind sry for the delay, I'm referring to project propeties, like when a project is right-clicked ->properties, is there a way I can get those same details through an eclipse plugin?
Aug 01 16:13:32 <nitind>	themiddleman_: So you don't mean accessing them, you mean opening the same dialog?
Aug 01 16:13:47 <themiddleman_>	yeah accessing them would be fine
Aug 01 16:15:18 <themiddleman_>	not really opening with a dialog
Aug 01 16:18:11 <nitind>	themiddleman_: Take a look at the two URLs I posted earlier (in the voice of Ida).
Aug 01 16:24:41 <davidmichaelkarr>	If I've created a Dynamic Web Project with the usual defaults, but I want to move step by step to a Maven organization, how do I properly move "WebContent" to "src/main/webapp"?
Aug 01 16:25:55 <themiddleman_>	@nitind so for example if a project also has git associated with it, when accessing the project properties I can see that it has git url associate with it, is there a way I can access that git URL?
Aug 01 16:29:50 <davidmichaelkarr>	Never mind.  Figured it out.
Aug 01 16:29:54 <nitind>	themiddleman_: I can only throw you at the jgit API, http://download.eclipse.org/jgit/site/4.4.1.201607150455-r/apidocs/index.html . The project isn't usually the git root itself.
Aug 01 16:32:24 <themiddleman_>	@nitind , ahhh ok
Aug 01 17:21:57 <themiddleman_>	hmmm, another dead end...
Aug 01 17:22:36 <themiddleman_>	is there a way to get the remote repository url of a project through a plugin?
Aug 01 17:25:21 <nitind>	Have you looked at how the GitProjectPropertyPage figures it out?
Aug 01 17:28:24 <themiddleman_>	@nitind , I have not, looking at it right now
Aug 01 18:27:36 <themiddleman_>	ok phew! Finally got it
Aug 01 19:45:52 <carabia>	nitind, I have not found a way to do it, if you asked me earlier.
Aug 01 19:46:34 <carabia>	I just figured, at least myself I found it kind of a crucial feature
Aug 01 19:47:02 <carabia>	Maybe not crucial, but a really really amazing quality of life -type of thing.
Aug 01 19:52:59 <themiddleman_>	so in order to get the git remote url for a project, I first get all the projects (IProject). 2. Iterating through all the projects I get the GITProvider through RepositoryProvider.getProvider. 3. get the repositoryMappings.entrySet, and iterate through the entrySet. 4.Get the repository from the RepositoryMapping, then follow http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2011/08/16/jgit-api-reading-configuration-information/

Aug 02 13:25:27 <davidmichaelkarr>	When running a REST service app in Tomcat in Eclipse, is there any way to prevent it from creating an editor view attempting to access the root url of the project?
Aug 02 13:37:39 <cores>	i have a really simple question, i want to open an existing c++ in place (it's in a source controlled directory), i don't want to "import" it. how can I do that?
Aug 02 13:38:05 <cores>	an existing c++ project in place, i mean
Aug 02 13:43:00 <cores>	i hope this "import existing projects into workspace" did the trick
Aug 02 13:43:50 <cores>	this "eclipse way" of doing things is confusing to a newcomer fresh off a vim,make,git workflow
Aug 02 13:44:36 <cores>	projects, workspaces, impoting, perspectives... what is going on..?

Aug 02 20:34:18 <donald1>	Ican create a new project but I can not edit it or open it on eclipse
Aug 02 21:40:44 <brandan>	what the directory where eclipse stores all it's settings in linux?
Aug 02 21:41:25 <brandan>	hmm
Aug 02 21:41:29 <brandan>	nvm
Aug 02 22:04:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: I figured it out.  It's a little weird, but even though Eclipse refers to the same Tomcat distro, it doesn't use the same server configs as the distro is using. I had to import the modified file into the server definition (which also strangely confused the server itself, because it wouldn't let me save the file until I stopped the server, but Eclipse
Aug 02 22:04:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	thought the server was already stopped. Restarting Eclipse fixed that.), then I could make additional changes to the imported files.
Aug 03 03:24:13 <Mazi>	Hi eclipse experts, can someone help with a question about Egit?
Aug 03 03:25:23 <Mazi>	At my local Git project I have edited some files and also added a new folder/library with ~500 files. How can I commit the new folder only? When using Team -> commit I get the list of all changed files but I want to commit the single folder + its files only.
Aug 03 03:25:24 <Arbalest>	Bug 500 does not exist.
Aug 03 03:39:11 <Stummi>	Mazi, git does not know anything about directories
Aug 03 03:39:21 <Stummi>	thats why you can't commit empty directories into a git repo
Aug 03 03:40:05 <Mazi>	Stummi, it is not empty. I just wonder if there is any easy way to commit a single directory only without other files which were also edited.
Aug 03 03:42:34 <Stummi>	ah, right, sorry. Misread your message
Aug 03 03:43:16 <Stummi>	not sure, I normally do stuff like this from the command line
Aug 03 04:09:16 <khlorghaal>	does CDT not support c++ 11? im getting erroneous errors and stackoverflow fixes arent working
Aug 03 04:09:40 <khlorghaal>	im using neon now, i was using indigo in the past and everything was fine
Aug 03 05:19:07 <khlorghaal>	started a new project and everything, bah ill just redownload indigo, its not like neon is a perceptible improvement
Aug 03 05:23:03 <khlorghaal>	there seems to be hundreds of people having issues like this and no fixes
Aug 03 07:15:11 <cores>	nitind: say you have a bunch of directories with make files and .cproject and .project files. how do i open them in eclipse so that i'm editing the files themselves, not just copies of the files?
Aug 03 07:15:23 <cores>	if that question even makes sense, obviously i'm a little confused
Aug 03 07:24:16 <jrtappers>	Is there a way to build an update site without launching a GUI instance of eclipse?
Aug 03 07:26:20 <jrtappers>	https://wiki.eclipse.org/PDE/User_Guide doesn't seem to have a section for update sites
Aug 03 09:06:41 <cores>	i feel like customizing eclipse is a full time job

Aug 03 12:52:12 <Jasaka>	If, while working, I remove a TODO or FIXME but it still displays as being there, how can I fix that? Or more generally: If eclipses error, warning or normal markers lag behind, how can I reload(?) them. Sorry if I'm not clear in my question as I'm not a native speaker.
Aug 03 12:58:46 <cores>	good question
Aug 03 12:58:50 <cores>	i have the same thing
Aug 03 13:03:05 <Jasaka>	Normally, it seems (with small projects) it reloads them on saving. But after a long time of work on a bigger project it just bugs out. I have a few classes which are now fully blue-underlined.
Aug 03 13:04:36 <psuzzi>	This seems a bug. Can you take a screenshot / anim gif, and report a new bug on Platform UI ?

Aug 03 16:28:14 <nitind>	cores: Once the git clone is in the Git Repositories View, use the context menu in the working directory tree to Import Projects from there. They will not be copied.
Aug 03 16:28:44 <nitind>	Jasaka: For what kind of file?
Aug 03 18:45:01 <Saul775>	Hello.  I'm creating a JAR file that uses Microsoft's JDBC driver.  However, everytime the method is invoked, I get a ClassNotFoundException.  I've had some help from people in #java and the Internet.  I'm instructed to set the classpath.  I thought I did this, but I still get the exception.  Where do I set the classpath in Eclipse?
Aug 03 18:45:21 <Saul775>	I've tried setting it under Window --> Preferences --> Java --> Build Path --> Classpath Variables.   Is this the correct location?
Aug 03 19:00:32 <nitind>	You would add the jar itself as a jar to the Java Build Path.
Aug 03 19:05:35 <Saul775>	Thank you, nitind.  I think I did this because I can see the JAR file under my referenced libraries.  Is this correct?
Aug 03 20:20:19 <nitind>	Saul775: yes. proably. haven't done JDBC in a while.

Aug 04 04:13:22 <waits_>	Is it possible to skip all the breakpoints until a certain method is executed in the call stack? I don't want to remove them.
Aug 04 04:27:30 <Amis>	Hello! I'm on Neon RC1 and I have a really hard time configuring C++11 support. I have a Makefile project with some custom (non-makefile) builder script and no matter what I do the eclipse indexer does not recognize the C++11 containers and elements. Some configuration settings: http://imgur.com/a/QECqv I've restarted several times and rebuild the index.
Aug 04 04:27:38 <Amis>	What am I doing wrong?
Aug 04 04:29:26 <Amis>	Is there some other magical settings hidden where I have to specify the flags?
Aug 04 04:30:12 <Amis>	Note that when I open a header that contains C++11 elements (like <memory>) then eclipse tells me that the __cplusplus define is not defined and excludes the code it guards
Aug 04 04:32:20 <Amis>	Correction: it says __cplusplus is defined as '199711L'
Aug 04 04:42:52 <Amis>	Thank god it solved itself because I was about the split my desk in half. It turns out that my freshly created Makefile project was not using the global provider settings so it did not have the "-std=c++11" flag added.
Aug 04 07:35:51 <Guest47968>	How can I make EGit ignore git repositories in subdirectories on pull? I just want to pull the top-level repository and not all git repositries in subdirectories.
Aug 04 12:05:37 <jmspeex>	Anyone knows how to prevent the "build on save" feature from triggering an infinite loop of builds on my project?
Aug 04 12:06:10 <jmspeex>	It started happening after I upgraded from Mars to Neon (upgrading Fedora 22 to Fedora 24)
Aug 04 12:45:43 <nitind>	That's really up to the builders.
Aug 04 12:46:20 <nitind>	wainersm: You can Disable the other breakpoints without fully Removing them. Check the Breakpoints View.

Aug 04 14:40:10 <ipun>	Arbalest thanks, will do
Aug 04 14:47:14 <ipun>	Considering this atricle is about 7 years old, I am wondering how I can extend org.eclipse.ui.ide.markersupport'
Aug 04 14:47:41 <ipun>	's markerField. The article is here: http://blog.eclipse-tips.com/2008/11/creating-custom-marker-view.html
Aug 04 14:49:47 <nitind>	That's a question to ask only after you've tried it and found out that it doesn't work that way any more.
Aug 04 15:05:30 <ipun>	nitind, i've currently been trying it on an existing extension point, the Problems view. I'm trying to get the "projects" column to display
Aug 04 15:06:26 <nitind>	What does the Problems View have to do with it?
Aug 04 15:07:47 <ipun>	im trying to develop something on the Problems view, so i am trying to get an additional field to come up, more importantly, the projects column to start
Aug 04 15:46:04 <jrtappers>	I seem to be having an issue with classes used for preferences
Aug 04 15:46:33 <jrtappers>	I get null pointers for private static final strings that have the value set immediately
Aug 04 15:46:58 <jrtappers>	private static final FOO = "bar";
Aug 04 15:47:05 <jrtappers>	And then the value later on is null
Aug 04 15:50:47 <nitind>	Where?
Aug 04 15:50:51 <nitind>	Also in a static?
Aug 04 15:54:44 <jrtappers>	Statics and also instance methods
Aug 04 15:55:15 <jrtappers>	Mainly static methods though
Aug 04 15:59:16 <jrtappers>	It seems to be ok if I have a static method that sets the values and manually call it before getting the values [removing the final], but not if it is declared and assigned together, although this seems like a messy workaround
Aug 04 16:11:47 <jrtappers>	Similar example - http://pastebin.com/ZR5EUBkS - On line 64 vals contains 12 nulls
Aug 04 16:12:17 <jrtappers>	It is a similar issue in enums
Aug 04 16:15:27 <jrtappers>	The method [setDefaults()] is called from a method [initializeDefaultPreferences()] which is part of a class registered as a PreferenceInitializer

Aug 05 11:13:06 <davidmichaelkarr>	I'm running Tomcat (TomEE) from Eclipse, and after I renamed a project (cloned, deleted old one), now Tomcat is confused with some sort of JMX error at container startup.  Is there some cache I need to delete?
Aug 05 12:00:13 <nitind>	Gamoder_: Is there a bug report?
Aug 05 12:00:23 <nitind>	davidmichaelkarr: confused how?
Aug 05 12:01:21 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: " java.lang.ClassCastException: Cannot cast org.apache.cxf.management.jmx.InstrumentationManagerImpl to org.apache.cxf.management.InstrumentationManager".  This might be a CXF and/or TomEE problem.  I'm pursuing this on #openejb also.
Aug 05 12:01:49 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: But I didn't see this error before I "renamed" the project (cloned, then deleted old one).
Aug 05 12:01:53 <nitind>	Looks like a classloader problem. Weird.

Aug 09 12:00:07 <davidmichaelkarr>	Ah.  I just had to select the file I wanted added to ignore list.
Aug 09 12:07:57 <davidmichaelkarr>	Curious.  The "Add to svn:ignore" function is clearly bound to "Ctrl+Alt+I", but pressing that key after selecting a resource to be ignored does nothing. You still have to right-click and select the option in the submenu.

Aug 11 01:24:00 <luxigo>	Ok now we have a dark theme after ten years.... but why is it still so much a pain in the sas to darken the background more (I mean to black) and not only the editor window ?  (It's not a question, its an exasperatid sigh...)
Aug 11 01:24:26 <luxigo>	ted
Aug 11 01:24:32 <luxigo>	*SIGH*
Aug 11 04:21:41 <lilalinux>	How do you hide the "Javascript Resources" virtual folder from Project Explorer?
Aug 11 04:21:59 <lilalinux>	It can't be removed via the triangle menu
Aug 11 08:43:14 <NightStrike>	If I want an eclipse IDE that combines CDT and normal java editing, what's the best way to go about putting that together?  I could for instance have two installations (probably the worst choice), I could d/l CDT and try to install Java plugins, I could d/l the basic java ide and try ot install CDT to it, or some other option?
Aug 11 08:52:54 <NightStrike>	Using the installer seems to prefer putting each IDE in a separate directory.... eclipse/cpp-neon and eclipse/java-neon....   but that seems to indicate that I need two very separate IDEs
Aug 11 09:13:11 <lilalinux>	NightStrike: I always find it easier to start with CDT and then possible other stuff
Aug 11 09:42:08 <mpiggott>	With Neon I've started to get a bunch of 'java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xml.namespace.XMLNamespacePackage' while Auto-Saving Workspace. Restarting Eclipse entirely loses the perspective's layout and tiles all the views
Aug 11 09:43:51 <mpiggott>	Also another EMF related stack trace for Oomph 'Setup Check'
Aug 11 10:01:51 <Kakemo>	Hi, I'm coding in C++ with Eclipse and I'm having trouble installing GMP and linking it with Eclipse. Can someone help me ?
Aug 11 10:46:15 <freeone3000>	Hi. On a fresh install of Eclipse Neon, attempting to start it gives me "Eclipse could not start the Virtual Machine. Eclipse will now exit." However, I don't have an error log in the application directory - where should I look for the eclipse logs for this issue?
Aug 11 10:47:30 <freeone3000>	I haven't chosen a workspace yet, so it's not there either.
Aug 11 10:48:07 <mpiggott>	freeone3000, possibly the working directory or ~/.eclipse maybe?
Aug 11 10:49:47 <freeone3000>	mpiggott: No, no logs - it does have infos.txt which lists the JVMs and which one it chose, though, and it's a valid JVM.
Aug 11 10:50:57 <mpiggott>	freeone3000, there is also the cli option -consoleLog https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_Where_can_I_find_that_elusive_.log_file%3F
Aug 11 10:52:45 <freeone3000>	Ah. "Java started but returned exit code 1". And then immediately exits. That's... better, I guess.
Aug 11 11:16:56 <nitind>	freeone3000: "it's a valid JVM" --which one was it?
Aug 11 13:26:52 <freeone3000>	nitind: Oracle 1.8.0 64-bit.
Aug 11 13:31:15 <nitind>	freeone3000: More specific than that?
Aug 11 13:31:53 <freeone3000>	nitind: "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0;1;8;0;64;true;1395170345840"?
Aug 11 13:33:17 <nitind>	freeone3000: I really meant is it the newest 1.8.0, and I trust this is a 64-bit Neon download?
Aug 11 13:35:13 <freeone3000>	nitind: Launcher library is "C:\Users\temp\.p2\pool\plugins\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_64_1.1.400.v20160518-1444". And the JDK is b132, so not *newest* but not terribly old.
Aug 11 13:36:36 <nitind>	From the Command Prompt, are you able to run that installed copy of java.exe?
Aug 11 13:37:33 <freeone3000>	nitind: Yes.
Aug 11 13:37:47 <nitind>	How'd you install Neon?
Aug 11 13:38:14 <freeone3000>	nitind: There was a x64 installer on eclipse.org, co-branded "oomph". I downloaded and ran that.
Aug 11 13:41:39 <nitind>	Have you edited the eclipse.ini file manually?
Aug 11 13:41:48 <freeone3000>	No, this is a fresh install.
Aug 11 14:04:03 <nitind>	Where did it get installed?
Aug 11 14:05:39 <freeone3000>	nitind: C:\Users\temp\eclipse
Aug 11 14:05:47 <freeone3000>	nitind: %HOME% is C:\Users\temp
Aug 11 14:07:30 <nitind>	This launcher library detail, did a dialog pop open with the -1 and bunch of other stuff
Aug 11 14:07:34 <nitind>	?
Aug 11 14:07:57 <freeone3000>	nitind: Yeah, it gave me the error code 1 and the list of launch options.
Aug 11 14:08:12 <nitind>	Can you post the ~image ?

Aug 11 14:38:44 <themiddleman>	hello all
Aug 11 14:41:01 <freeone3000>	nitind: https://imgur.com/a/XVsnP
Aug 11 14:44:08 <nitind>	freeone3000: Can you try editing the c:\Users\temp\eclipse\cpp-neon\eclipse\eclipse.ini file and removing the lines that start with -XX: ?
Aug 11 14:46:59 <freeone3000>	nitind: Alright, that gets me to the splash screen. Thanks.
Aug 11 14:47:19 <themiddleman>	somewhat quick question, my computer had restarted abruptly and it seems as if eclipse doesn't seem to recognize any plugin dependencies I have for my plugin project
Aug 11 14:47:42 <nitind>	dependencies that are in the workspace?
Aug 11 14:49:50 <themiddleman>	err they are for a plugin project
Aug 11 14:50:02 <nitind>	still applies
Aug 11 14:50:27 <themiddleman>	they are more like dependencies that should be with eclipse like org.eclipse.jface
Aug 11 14:50:37 <themiddleman>	or org.eclipse.ui
Aug 11 14:50:59 <nitind>	Information about where those are on-disk might have gone squirrely. From the preference page (Preferences > Plug-in Development > Target Platform), try Removing the Running Platform target definition, Applying, and then Restoring Defaults.
Aug 11 14:51:17 <nitind>	Or, at the last, putting them back the way you'd put them before.
Aug 11 14:52:37 <themiddleman>	ahhh ok thanks that did the trick
Aug 11 14:53:05 <freeone3000>	nitind: Yep, everything's working now! Weird that the -XX were specified by default when they didn't work, thanks.
Aug 12 12:31:42 <Restioson>	Hi. How can I prevent eGit from creating a folder inside of my repo and putting my stuff there instead of at it's root?
Aug 12 14:39:45 <chealer>	hi. when I open a function documentation page from PHP's manual via Content assist proposals, it strangely opens in a small tooltip-like zone in Eclipse rather than in my browser. Is this a known issue and if not, can it open in my browser?
Aug 12 14:41:51 <chealer>	Version 4.6.0 on Windows, with Eclipse set to use Firefox.
Aug 12 16:20:14 <chealer>	I reported in ticket #499629
Aug 13 02:59:19 <upgrdman>	are there any plugins for profiling java program per line (not just per-function time, but "hot spots" with line granularity) ?
Aug 13 11:44:45 <donald>	how to display old projects to the package explorer of eclipse?
Aug 14 02:31:06 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Pardon.. I'm quietly lusing my mind.  When creating an SWT button, there is an autocomplete for adding a selection listener.
Aug 14 02:32:09 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Button b1 = new Button(shell, SWT.PUSH);  b1.addSelectionListener(new SelectionAdapter()   and there is something here that causes Eclipse to offer to add missing methods.

Aug 15 15:45:23 <nitind>	You are impatient, but the answer would have been "yes."
Aug 15 17:15:58 <huck5>	Is there a way in Eclipse, maybe with a plugin, to see/track Java web-application HTTP Requests/Request forwarding?
Aug 15 17:19:22 <nitind>	whose requests? what forwarding?
Aug 15 17:26:24 <huck5>	The project I'm in does a lot of request redirects, which I don't see in my Web Console. Just wondering if there's an easy way to track that from within Eclipse
Aug 15 17:26:39 <huck5>	So say HTML5Controller gets a request... it then just forwards that whole request to another Servlet.
Aug 15 19:53:49 <Bento324>	When I try to create a JUnit Test Case, every time I specify a Class under test, it tells me the Class under test does not exist in current project. It clearly does, because I can browse and find it, and if I manually write the test it works. It won't let me Finish unless I clear out the Class under test. Has anyone else run into this?
Aug 16 04:14:02 <tusharm>	is anyone here experienced with swtbot (test cases for eclipse plugins)? I need some help
Aug 16 04:14:54 <tusharm>	The editors that I have extended from TextEditor are unable to pick up their resource bundles while testing with swtbot but this works when trying it out manually
Aug 16 04:15:07 <tusharm>	even a link to something useful would greatly help
Aug 16 05:02:59 <yin_yang2k>	Is git.eclipse.org down? I can't use the Oomph installer.

Aug 16 14:38:53 <afx_>	Hello ! I am using debian 8 x64 and want to install eclipse-neon . Should I run the installer as root ? also thinking to install it under /opt folder .Is that safe?
Aug 16 14:50:54 <nitind>	It can unnecessarily complicate things, but it should be safe to install (and then *not* run) as root.
Aug 16 14:53:16 <afx_>	nitind, ok currently I get : Artifact download is progressing very slowly from the following hosts . Can be my inet connection , don't know
Aug 16 14:56:32 <afx_>	nitind, can I install it in home dir and then move it to /opt?
Aug 16 14:58:05 <nitind>	yeah, but why?

Aug 17 12:48:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	Zemeio: Opening a file does not require closing anything. Not sure what you mean.
Aug 17 12:49:49 <Zemeio>	When I use open type, it searches on every open project, wanted to know if you guys know how to search only a specific project
Aug 17 13:03:31 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I've got a glitch in my thinking of how projects and packages are managed in Eclipse.
Aug 17 13:03:59 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I can create a project in Eclipse (am using Java).
Aug 17 13:04:06 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I can create a package in that project.
Aug 17 13:04:25 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I believe I can create multiple packages within that project.
Aug 17 13:05:10 <Frigid_Cryotank>	But I do not understand the nomenclature such as packages having names like "com.gs.error", "com.gs.exec", "com.gs.whatever".
Aug 17 13:05:33 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Are each of these sub-packages executables in their own right?
Aug 17 13:06:14 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Or does Eclipse view them as all being required for an executable in the top level project?  (and now I'm not sure I'm phrasing the question properly).

Aug 17 15:00:12 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: A package is just a namespace mechanism, so you can arrange classes in sensible functional groups.  A package is not "executable".
Aug 17 15:25:33 <Frigid_Cryotank>	So if I have multiple source files inside a package, and one source imports a class from another java source file in the same package (namespace) then "all should be well" ...?
Aug 17 15:26:45 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: I don't know about that, but if you reference a class in the same package as the referencing class, you don't have to import it.
Aug 17 15:27:03 <nitind>	Import just lets you use the unqualified name of a type to refer to it, either by importing that type's fully qualified name or all the contents of a package (with the .*). You don't need to import types from the same package--that's the first place the compiler will look for types you refer to anyway.
Aug 17 15:27:58 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Apologies for it being ..cryptic.  What I've been doing is working my way through a tutorial on Java.  Each section of the tutorial has multiple problems... and I was wondering if Eclipse would let me organize all these separate projects into a hierarchy of projects.
Aug 17 15:29:10 <Frigid_Cryotank>	So there would be a "Strings" "project"... and under that would be a Project for the first problem, another for the second problem..
Aug 17 15:29:37 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Which probably looks terrible as far as the filesystem goes... but it's all about organizing things anyway...
Aug 17 15:30:13 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: That's not really practical.  It is possible to use "tasks", or "Mylyn", so that when you're working on the "strings" task, you can limit what you see to projects related to that.
Aug 17 15:30:46 <nitind>	Unless you're going to have projects that aren't for these problems, they're already in a group of sorts by being in a single workspace.
Aug 17 15:37:28 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Re: Mylyn: I'm still plodding my way through simple Java material.  But I think I see the point.  So... having separate projects for all these little problems is the way to go (for the moment).
Aug 17 15:40:07 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I was having a Terrible time with Neon under Slackware Linux.  The default GTK interface has far too much whitespace with the buttons, borders, just everything.  Setting Preferences --> General --> Appearance to "Classic" just didn't work... then found an old post saying "export SWT_GTK3=0"  .. and, oh my, that made Neon extremely responsive.

Aug 18 16:25:19 <defanco>	hello
Aug 18 16:25:20 <Arbalest>	Welcome! If you have a question, just ask, or take a look at our FAQ - http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ :) Try typing ~faq to see more FAQs!

Aug 18 16:29:42 <defanco>	Ran into a bit of an issue with Eclipse that I think could've been avoided. I have a plugin that has Scala nature, other developer checked out this plugin and tries to run it in product, but gets ClassNotFoundException on one of the classes in the plugin. Of course we forget that this plugin has Scala nature and thus expects Scala Builder that we don't have because we don't have Scala IDE installed. The question is why didn't Eclips
Aug 18 16:29:42 <defanco>	e throw some kind of error into Console informing of this fact?
Aug 18 16:31:13 <defanco>	I think these kind of errors are common but hard to diagnose because NoClassFoundException can mean many things being wrong with the plugin
Aug 18 16:36:26 <defanco>	And I think in this particular situation solution is even more simpler since if UI is smart enough to mark Builder as missing, it could go extra step and log warning in the console...
Aug 18 19:14:50 <zave_>	hello, does anyone know what to do about this error "The BPMN Diagram element is not enabled in this Tool Profile"? i think it's the reason why when i drag events into the diagram, they won't stick. am i on the right track?
Aug 19 03:15:54 <jablo>	Swithced to a high-resolution (4K) display. Oh my, now Eclipse is almost unusable due to slooooow scrolling.
Aug 19 03:17:33 <jablo>	I switched from Netbeans to Eclipse for that reason. Now I fear I'll have to switch to Qtcreator (we're a C++/Qt shop).
Aug 19 03:24:20 <mvvvv>	jablo, what is your GPU ?
Aug 19 03:28:47 <jablo>	It's a Dell M3800. GPU is Nvidia Quadro K1100M GPU as far as I know
Aug 19 03:28:52 <jablo>	Linux, Ubuntu 14.04
Aug 19 03:30:28 <jablo>	Oh - I'm using X.Org X server -- Nouveau display driver. Maybe I should try the NVIDIA binary driver.
Aug 19 03:42:31 <jablo>	No. Even using NVIDIA binary driver, mouse-wheel scrolling is horribly slow. Eclipse can't keep up and is lagging 10s of seconds behind.
Aug 19 03:43:01 <jablo>	(sigh. I hate QtCreator and only use it when I absolutely have to in some debug sessions)
Aug 19 03:44:46 <mvvvv>	jablo, do you know what is your kernel version ?
Aug 19 03:45:14 <jablo>	Linux jl 3.16.0-77-generic #99~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jun 28 19:17:10 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Aug 19 03:45:18 <lookshe>	how can i skip the unnecessary local repository when cloning a git repository from eclipse?
Aug 19 03:46:52 <mvvvv>	jablo, I know that kernel 4.4 (ubuntu 16.04) has  dramatically enhanced the free video drivers
Aug 19 03:48:30 <jablo>	Oh. Interesting. Maybe that's a reason for upgrading (ie. re-installing), I was thinking of waiting for the .1 release and do an in-place upgrade instead. Hmm,.
Aug 19 03:49:20 <jablo>	QtCreator in comparison is lightning fast. Netbeans was horribly slow even on normal HD resolution. Eclipse is nice and fast on HD resolution, but can't keep up on 4K
Aug 19 03:49:22 <mvvvv>	jablo, on the other hand I've seen many problems with nvidia drivers on 16.04
Aug 19 03:49:34 <jablo>	Oh, the joy of upgrading :)(
Aug 19 03:50:41 <mvvvv>	jablo, To evaluate my driver I test some webgl experiments (looking for the highter FPS)
Aug 19 03:59:26 <jablo>	Well, glxgears full screen 4K gives 196 fps
Aug 19 04:00:57 <jablo>	With 97% idle cpu... I guess all work is done on the GPU :)
Aug 19 04:01:56 <mvvvv>	sounds good yes
Aug 19 04:04:23 <mvvvv>	jablo, did you tried SWT_GTK3=0 before launching eclipse ?
Aug 19 04:11:52 <jablo>	wvvvv set SWT_GTK3=0  as an environment variable before starting eclipse?
Aug 19 04:12:14 <mvvvv>	Yes to use GTK2 libs instead of GTK3
Aug 19 04:12:31 <mvvvv>	this workaround can save performance
Aug 19 04:12:48 <jablo>	wvvvv, now wow, THAT really helps!
Aug 19 04:13:53 <mvvvv>	ok so because of old ubuntu 14.04 you have this old problem. Ubuntu 16.04 + eclipse neon have fix this
Aug 19 04:19:38 <jablo>	wvvvv, thanks a lot. (now wondering if this or a similar solution is possible for Netbeans)
Aug 19 04:20:48 <mvvvv>	jablo, don't think cause Netbeans do not use GTK
Aug 19 04:25:30 <jablo>	I really need to clean up my workflow. I love Eclipse for editing C++ files, and need to use QtCreator for debugging when there's a need to inspect and evaluate Qt data structures, but I use Netbeans for resolving git merge/rebase conflicts.
Aug 19 04:25:43 <jablo>	what a mess
Aug 19 04:26:23 <mvvvv>	egit on eclipse is nice
Aug 19 04:28:58 <jablo>	Hmm. I rarely dare use guis for git commands. Most git commands I use the command line - then for conflict resolution I like Netbeans graphical representation. I'm a strange person, I guess.
Aug 19 04:37:01 <jablo>	Thanks anyway for speeding up my Eclipse! You've really made my day, wvvvv
Aug 19 08:39:49 <dimm>	hello, community!
Aug 19 08:40:19 <dimm>	can't run eclipse with '-xms2048M -xmx2048M'
Aug 19 08:40:28 <dimm>	only with 1024M working
Aug 19 08:41:01 <dimm>	is this possible to run eclipse more than 1024M '-vm'?
Aug 19 09:04:56 <dimm>	solved
Aug 19 09:05:09 <dimm>	it was trouble with free ram on pc :-)
Aug 19 09:54:32 <dimm>	not solved
Aug 19 09:54:43 <dimm>	is somebody have the same error?
Aug 19 09:55:45 <Stummi>	dimm, are you on 32 bit?
Aug 19 09:56:11 <Stummi>	-Xms500m -Xmx4g in eclipse.ini works fine for me
Aug 19 09:58:25 <dimm>	not 32 bit, "mixed mode" as far as i understand it is 64bit
Aug 19 10:00:36 <Stummi>	dimm, which OS?
Aug 19 10:00:46 <dimm>	windows 7
Aug 19 10:01:06 <dimm>	omg, it seems like if it 64bit, then must say about it... it seems like i on 32bit
Aug 19 10:01:42 <Stummi>	dimm, what does "java -version" say?
Aug 19 10:01:49 <Stummi>	(last line)
Aug 19 10:02:37 <dimm>	ah, my project must on 32bit
Aug 19 10:03:04 <dimm>	Stummi: sorry, developer was close window... i wait for information
Aug 19 10:03:27 <dimm>	Stummi: i just say that it is 1.6.0_24
Aug 19 10:03:47 <dimm>	Stummi: and have not '64-bit' words on 'java-version'
Aug 19 10:05:48 <Stummi>	1.6.0 is pretty old
Aug 19 10:06:01 <dimm>	yeah :-)
Aug 19 10:06:13 <dimm>	we have some restrictions there
Aug 19 10:06:35 <Stummi>	the restriction to stick to software versions with security issues?
Aug 19 10:06:43 <davidmichaelkarr>	dimm: And have you determined for certain that you're on a 64-bit OS?
Aug 19 10:07:07 <davidmichaelkarr>	Were there 64-bit OSes when 1.6 was released? :)
Aug 19 10:07:22 <Stummi>	well, when java -version does not mention its 64 bit, the platform is irrelevant anyway. Its a 32 bit jvm
Aug 19 10:07:55 <Stummi>	and a 32 bit jvm cannot take more than 2gb (minus some overhead)
Aug 19 10:08:17 <davidmichaelkarr>	dimm: It's worthwhile to point out that even if you're required to use 1.6 for your application, there should be nothing wrong with using the latest JDK to run Eclipse.
Aug 19 10:09:05 <Stummi>	can the current eclipse even run with 1.6?
Aug 19 10:09:11 <davidmichaelkarr>	The best I was able to get on 32-bit windows was 1536mb.
Aug 19 10:09:38 <dimm>	thank you, guyz

Aug 19 18:04:31 <motaka2>	hello from where I can download the latest version of eclipse for linux. I look for the url
Aug 19 18:05:30 <davidmichaelkarr>	motaka2: Just go to https://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php and follow the Download links.
Aug 19 18:06:04 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: i know but I am on a windows machine
Aug 19 18:06:12 <motaka2>	it just suggests me exe

Aug 19 18:38:52 <juacado>	Hi, I'm working in an Eclipse CDT Makefile project, I've added a new make target named 'install' (in the makefile and Make Target inspector) to copy some files to /usr/local/ but when I double-click it I get a 'Permission denied' error (as it's obvious)
Aug 19 18:39:20 <juacado>	so I added a sudo before cp, then I get 'no tty present and no askpass program specified' error
Aug 19 18:39:36 <juacado>	any suggestion that doesn't involve to tweak sudoers file?
Aug 19 19:19:44 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: have you seen this?
Aug 19 19:20:33 <davidmichaelkarr>	motaka2: ?
Aug 19 19:20:47 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: sorry http://www.eclipse.org/rap/
Aug 19 19:21:36 <davidmichaelkarr>	motaka2: Nope, never seen that.
Aug 19 19:22:00 <motaka2>	is there anything wrong with using this for an enterprise project
Aug 19 19:22:00 <motaka2>	?
Aug 19 19:27:11 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: :)
Aug 19 19:30:46 <davidmichaelkarr>	motaka2: Are you really asking me whether I think a tool that I just said I've never heard of is viable to use for projects?
Aug 19 19:32:18 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: yes. I am from php background and I am in primitive steps of creating an automation app with java. every bit of info will be apreciated
Aug 20 07:02:43 <jayaura>	Hi, I have a project that is created in windows. I looked at one of the SDK env vars, and was a windows path. I changed it to linux path. But the change is not reflected in projectinfo.xml How do I regenerate the file ?
Aug 20 07:03:09 <jayaura>	sorry, forgot to mention that I am on linux
Aug 20 08:23:30 <ZeekL>	Heyas, a asset view question.  Using Neon right now.  I have a jar in my Reference Libraries which has some json assets.  When I try to view them it says "Problem opening an editor.  Problem opening editor for 'sample.json': 'System editor can only open file based resources'.  Is there a setting or add on which can let me view those asset resources?
Aug 20 13:13:33 <juacado>	is it not possible to upgrade Mars to Neon? do Ineed to install from scratch?
Aug 20 14:22:55 <davidmichaelkarr>	juacado: believe so, yes.
Aug 20 14:24:14 <Gaulouis>	Hello,
Aug 20 14:24:23 <Gaulouis>	Q: How to install maven plugin ?
Aug 20 14:24:36 <Gaulouis>	I would like to install antlr4-maven-plugin
Aug 20 17:52:46 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Am using Neon and have run into a weird ..thing.  What does it mean when the editor text cursor flips between red and black on a source line?
Aug 20 19:33:29 <motaka2>	has anyone here seen eclipse RAP and scout ? what do you think of it ?
Aug 20 22:35:04 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Is there a way to get the Project Explorer in Eclipse Neon to sort by time/date ?
Aug 20 23:10:48 <thatGuy__>	hello, anyone here?
Aug 21 00:02:58 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: No.
Aug 21 00:03:16 <Frigid_Cryotank>	davidmichaelkarr: Thank you.
Aug 21 00:03:46 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: But note that there are plugins that allow you to open OS file explorer window in the same location.
Aug 21 00:05:31 <Frigid_Cryotank>	<sigh>  Installed Ecipse last Monday... too many plugins.. will check to see if there is a Linux equivalent.
Aug 21 00:11:18 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: Haven't used it, but <https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/open-explorer> appears to do that.
Aug 21 00:11:47 <Frigid_Cryotank>	davidmichaelkarr: Thank you. I'll take a look.
Aug 21 09:39:59 <juacado>	Hi, Eclipse Neon doesn't restart (File menu > Restart), it just quits Eclipse but never launches it again, am I the only one? (I'm using Ubuntu 16.04)
Aug 21 09:40:14 <juacado>	I can't seem to find anything related to that :/
Aug 21 10:02:15 <davidmichaelkarr>	juacado: first, have you turned off gtk3?
Aug 21 11:25:39 <juacado>	davidmichaelkarr, do you mean "Exec=env SWT_GTK3=0 eclipse"? I thought that was only for Mars :)
Aug 21 11:25:42 <juacado>	Thanks for the tip
Aug 21 11:46:09 <davidmichaelkarr>	juacado: There are different ways to do it. I don't know for sure if the GTK3 problems still persist on Neon.  I'd be surprised if it was fixed in Neon.
Aug 21 11:49:21 <juacado>	I added that line to my eclipse.desktop and it works now
Aug 21 14:55:15 <juacado>	I'm in a Makefile project, I've included <memory>, and then in the code I'm using std::shared_ptr, but it's underlined in red and says 'Symbol 'shared_ptr' could not be resolved' so I can't compile from the IDE...
Aug 21 14:55:28 <juacado>	however I can compile from command line with no issues...
Aug 21 14:55:41 <juacado>	I tried rebuilding the index, but no luck :/
Aug 21 14:56:13 <juacado>	in the makefile I'm using -std=c++11
Aug 21 16:15:49 <jablo>	juacado can eclipse find the include file <memory> ? Ie. can you Ctrl-leftclick on  <memory>  and have eclipse open the header file?
Aug 21 17:53:56 <al_nz1>	SO is M2Eclipse already installed in 4.6
Aug 21 18:00:49 <motaka2>	is eclipse RAP a good thing to create tools with it ?
Aug 21 18:05:13 <al_nz1>	But when I go to Run As Maven on a pom file I get "No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?"
Aug 21 18:05:22 <al_nz1>	but i have added the jdk

Aug 22 09:11:45 <sam__>	mvvvv: do you have any idea on that ?
Aug 22 09:11:58 <mvvvv>	sam__, I guess that upgrade to a newest version of eclipse (Neon or Mars) is the solution to this bug :(
Aug 22 09:12:49 <sam__>	so, we can't apply a patch for that ?
Aug 22 09:13:57 <mvvvv>	not for eclipse 4.3

Aug 22 12:50:09 <enleeten>	but make sure to back everything up before editing :)
Aug 22 12:50:40 <guest___>	there is no .project file in the GIT. I am creating new one from scratch during import
Aug 22 12:53:29 <enleeten>	does the git repo contain svn metadata? like a .svn folder?
Aug 22 12:53:48 <guest___>	No, it does not
Aug 22 13:01:26 <guest___>	Ok, I was able to "Import as a general project" and then convert . Still, "import as new" does not work :-(
Aug 22 14:40:40 <Sash>	Hi, in the release note there was the feature announced that neon supports hidpi screens. hot do I activate it (linux, running kde)? right now text and icons are tiny (look unscaled)
Aug 22 15:03:38 <badloop>	so, is it possible to create an eclipse project it a git repository without it having a toplevel folder in the project?
Aug 22 15:03:49 <badloop>	*in a git repository
Aug 22 15:04:15 <nitind>	Too many "it"s.
Aug 22 15:05:12 <badloop>	so many
Aug 22 15:05:15 <badloop>	:-P
Aug 22 15:06:47 <nitind>	Maybe an ~image would help?
Aug 22 15:06:47 <Arbalest>	Please upload your screenshots online and then paste the link back to the channel - http://imgur.com/ - http://imagebin.ca/
Aug 22 15:07:03 <badloop>	screenshot of what?
Aug 22 15:07:16 <nitind>	What it looks like and what it should look like.
Aug 22 15:07:25 <badloop>	ah ok
Aug 22 15:07:29 <badloop>	one sec
Aug 22 15:08:20 <nitind>	Usually the new project wizard offers a "Location" field, possibly in an Advanced section, to let you put the project directory anywhere you want.
Aug 22 15:11:56 <badloop>	essentially, i dont want a project folder in the repo
Aug 22 15:12:05 <badloop>	i just want the *contents* of the project folder in the repo
Aug 22 15:14:06 <badloop>	perhaps i should revisit how i'm storing the data on my server
Aug 22 15:23:42 <Sash>	just in case anyone has the same problem as me (the hidpi issue). that fixed it: "echo Xft.dpi: 190 | xrdb -merge" replace 190 with the right setting for your screen
Aug 22 16:25:07 <cores>	hidpi issue?
Aug 22 17:35:24 <cjoseph>	Hi, I have a project that I imported as an existing git repository a couple months ago. At the time the project was mostly python, but today we added a java folder to the repository
Aug 22 17:35:48 <cjoseph>	what is the best way to add the java nature?
Aug 22 17:36:23 <cjoseph>	is it possible to have a second .project file for this java subfolder?
Aug 22 17:37:03 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: Best to have them as separate projects.
Aug 22 17:37:20 <cjoseph>	I cannot separate them into two git repositories
Aug 22 17:37:24 <cjoseph>	so how will that work?
Aug 22 17:38:28 <cjoseph>	(a higher power than I has decreed that the java and python code shall exist in the same repo)
Aug 22 17:49:39 <nitind>	Are you saying the entire repository is one project in the workspace?  Is the folder in question already being treated as a project?
Aug 22 17:50:21 <cjoseph>	yes
Aug 22 17:50:26 <cjoseph>	nitind: yes
Aug 22 17:50:39 <cjoseph>	I used the "import git" wizard
Aug 22 17:51:02 <cjoseph>	at the time basically everything was python
Aug 22 17:51:38 <cjoseph>	now the existing python/git project has a new java subdirectory
Aug 22 17:52:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: And what is your intention for how the Python code and the Java code would interact?  Would they even be part of the same deployment artifact?
Aug 22 17:53:35 <cjoseph>	they will not interact, but the python code doesn't exist in a neat "python" subdirectory
Aug 22 17:54:00 <cjoseph>	there are half a dozen folders containing python code and this one new java folder
Aug 22 17:54:40 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: So at runtime they are effectively completely separate, and you've decided to essentially lump all the code together, even though they will have nothing to do with each other at runtime?
Aug 22 17:55:27 <cjoseph>	yes
Aug 22 17:55:34 <cjoseph>	as I explained earlier, I have no control over this
Aug 22 17:56:04 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: Yeah, whatever.  Good luck.\
Aug 22 17:56:15 <cjoseph>	thanks?
Aug 22 17:56:20 <cjoseph>	that was very unhelpful
Aug 22 17:56:48 <cjoseph>	everyone else wants to keep the code in one place
Aug 22 18:00:12 <cjoseph>	and I'm trying to find the best way to deal with this decision
Aug 22 18:00:44 <nitind>	Right clikc on the project in the Project Explorer or Navigator and look under the Configure menu.
Aug 22 18:01:56 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: nitind might be able to help you hack together a solution, but lumping all the code into a single project just makes all of it harder to manage.  Bad decision.  Look up "separation of concerns" sometime.
Aug 22 18:02:23 <cjoseph>	nitind: I see options to convert the project to a faceted form, tex, wikitext or javascript ptoject.
Aug 22 18:03:08 <cjoseph>	davidmichaelkarr: it's multiple projects in a single git repository which is somewhat different
Aug 22 18:03:12 <nitind>	Faceted form might allow it to then become a Java project.
Aug 22 18:03:42 <cjoseph>	is there any way to import the subfolder as a new java project?
Aug 22 18:04:23 <nitind>	A subfolder in an existing project?
Aug 22 18:04:28 <cjoseph>	davidmichaelkarr: and you are talking to me as if I made this decision personally, which I did not. I don't need to look up separation of concerns
Aug 22 18:04:34 <cjoseph>	your saltiness is not appreciated
Aug 22 18:05:17 <cjoseph>	nitind: yes...no idea if that's possible but if it is it seems like an easy solution.
Aug 22 18:05:28 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: Doesn't matter who made it.
Aug 22 18:05:32 <nitind>	I don't think that is supported.
Aug 22 18:07:07 <cjoseph>	davidmichaelkarr: lol yes it does, but whatever. enjoy your hobby of harassing people for things outside of their control on an IRC channel
Aug 22 18:07:30 <cjoseph>	I appreciated your initial advice, however.

Aug 23 03:29:00 <mistria>	eahmedshendy: yes, you can; although I don't know whereas there are many Che users here ATM
Aug 23 03:31:54 <eahmedshendy>	I can only find docker, vargant or yatta as a way of installation

Aug 23 06:00:18 <duelle>	Hi, how can I close only one window of eclipse in i3wm without closing the whole eclipse application?
Aug 23 06:00:44 <duelle>	(Eclipse Neon, Arch Linux, i3wm)
Aug 23 06:21:49 <mistria>	duelle: no issue with other window systems, maybe ask the i3wm community
Aug 23 06:54:42 <duelle>	mistria: Thanks for the hint. But there is no button (apart from the [x] that is not displayed in i3) that closes just the current window (or something similar)?
Aug 23 06:56:09 <mistria>	duelle: I'm not sure I understand the question. Eclipse just looks like other mainstream apps such as Thunderbird, Gimp... regarding buttons on my machine. See screenshots on other WM to figure it out and see how it is different in i3wm
Aug 23 07:00:07 <duelle>	mistria: I have eclipse neon with two windows opened and I can't find a way to close only one window. When I use File->Exit both windows close and when restarting eclipse both windows are back again. I am missing a way/shortcut/button to close one of the windows. As far as I can remember from using xfce this was possible with using the [x] on the titlebar - though there is no such button on the title bar
Aug 23 07:00:13 <duelle>	in tiling wms. I found a similar 'issue' at stackexchange for fvwm (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4812868/how-to-close-an-open-window-of-eclipse) which unfortunately is not applicable for i3wm. What I am looking for is another option/menu entry to close just one window.
Aug 23 07:58:21 <jrtappers>	How would I change how collapsed code looks? My plugin collapses code correctly, but I want it to show only the first line, not the first and last
Aug 23 08:47:45 <Marcel_>	fuck
Aug 23 08:47:47 <Marcel_>	really
Aug 23 08:47:53 <Marcel_>	is there anyone???
Aug 23 10:53:38 <ttwhy>	hey there, is the RDT (remote development tool) usable for every language (e.g. Java with ant files?)
Aug 23 11:29:39 <davidmichaelkarr>	Sigh.  I started up Eclipse on my VM this morning, and I found that the workspace was corrupted.  It didn't seem to think that I had projects in it, even though it tried to restore my last edited files, which presented exceptions when I tried to do anything with them, as it couldn't find the files (even though I can clearly see them when I browse the
Aug 23 11:29:39 <davidmichaelkarr>	workspace outside of Eclipse). This kind of thing happened to me a lot last year, but almost everything is different.  About the only similarity is that I'm running Eclipse in a VM.
Aug 23 17:09:59 <juacado>	How come Eclipse CDT on Neon platform and Ubuntu 16.04 is drawing a red line under shared_ptr and saying 'Symbol could not be resolved'? However it compiles successfully inside the IDE and in command line
Aug 23 17:10:10 <juacado>	I think I've tried everything possible :(
Aug 23 17:47:23 <Abri>	it's on meth
Aug 24 01:23:43 <Amis>	Hello! I'm on Neon (4.6.0) and (C++) when declaring instances of classes Eclipse never offers me any proposals for the expected constructor arguments. This feature never actually worked for me. Is this a bug that's been in the code forever or I have something turned off.
Aug 24 01:24:04 <Amis>	Other proposals work fine and I see this bug has been posted a long time ago and marked as fixed.
Aug 24 01:28:28 <Amis>	Note: code proposal for constructors work when objects are created with "new"
Aug 24 01:28:34 <Amis>	But it does not when created on stack
Aug 24 03:47:51 <juacado>	Amis, what do you mean exactly, for example, that you define a custom constructor with a float as argument and then you hit ctrl+space and nothing shows up?
Aug 24 03:49:10 <Amis>	juacado, a sec, I create an example
Aug 24 03:50:54 <Amis>	juacado, http://pastebin.com/SMgramCE  if I press Ctrl+Space at the last character it does not give me anything.
Aug 24 03:51:28 <Amis>	Howere if I do ---   MyClass * inst = new MyClass(      then it does give me the proper contructor
Aug 24 03:52:39 <juacado>	that's weird, it works for my both ways
Aug 24 03:52:52 <juacado>	I don't know what the problem can be
Aug 24 03:56:01 <Amis>	I just created a brand new workspace with a brand new project and it worked for the first time ONLY. It showed up once but after that it doesn't show hints anymore.
Aug 24 03:58:27 <Amis>	Well yeah this is bullpoo. After restarting that workspace the code completition doesn't even work anymore :V
Aug 24 04:00:34 <Amis>	Oh, it's probably because it's downloading some silly update and that prevents the hint from starting at all
Aug 24 04:18:16 <juacado>	Amis, a different type of question, are you using C++11 features?
Aug 24 04:18:39 <Amis>	juacado, yes
Aug 24 04:19:18 <juacado>	do you have problems with, for example, std::shraed_ptr being underlined in red but the code still compiles succesfully?
Aug 24 05:53:32 <SimonKLB>	hi! anyone know how to make eclipse wrap the first method parameter to a new line if its too long?
Aug 24 05:53:53 <SimonKLB>	i am able to wrap the other parameters, but the first one seem to stick on the same line as the method name
Aug 24 05:56:28 <SimonKLB>	ah, and this is when having the method parameters line up by column, otherwise it's fine as well

Aug 24 09:05:03 <ImNotQ009>	Hello. I'm having a litle problem with the C/C++ IDE. I'm trying to get code indexer to work but it seems it fails to index all of the C++ stuff (like std::strings)
Aug 24 09:05:07 <ImNotQ009>	Any tips, please?
Aug 24 09:05:29 <ImNotQ009>	I'm using Eclipse 4.4
Aug 24 09:08:23 <ImNotQ009>	I added include directories for C and C++ libs in the project settings
Aug 24 09:08:30 <ImNotQ009>	It is finding includes just fine
Aug 24 09:35:25 <mistria>	ImNotQ009: hi, first, use the latest version (Neon, 4.6) of Eclipse IDE for C++ developers. Many things are improved from a version to another and maybe your issue has been worked on during the timeframe
Aug 24 09:35:47 <mistria>	ImNotQ009: you'll have much trouble to find people to give you support on older version on this channel
Aug 24 09:36:43 <ImNotQ009>	mistria: I
Aug 24 09:36:46 <ImNotQ009>	mistria: I'm afraid I can
Aug 24 09:37:07 <ImNotQ009>	*sigh* I'm sorry, I keep pressing enter when I mean to press the apostrophe
Aug 24 09:37:22 <ImNotQ009>	What I meant to say is that I can't use the latest version, because it's buggy for me
Aug 24 09:37:45 <ImNotQ009>	The interface is painfully slow and I experience a lot of line rendering issues
Aug 24 09:37:51 <ImNotQ009>	It's a known bug, I found a report about it
Aug 24 09:38:05 <mistria>	ImNotQ009: which os are you using?
Aug 24 09:38:09 <ImNotQ009>	Ubuntu
Aug 24 09:38:12 <ImNotQ009>	14.04 LTS
Aug 24 09:43:24 <davidmichaelkarr>	ImNotQ009: turn off gtk3.
Aug 24 09:44:40 <ImNotQ009>	Anyway, I fixed the problem, I had a couple things lacking
Aug 24 09:45:13 <ImNotQ009>	davidmichaelkarr: will try next time around, cheers
Aug 24 09:57:30 <Tazmain>	hi all, is there a way for eclipse's web page editor to pick up css and stuff for the preview it shows ?
Aug 24 09:59:32 <Tazmain>	or the web browser to set it up to know where to load the css from
Aug 24 10:01:01 <mistria>	Tazmain: Aren't you using relative path to the CSS file?
Aug 24 10:01:40 <Tazmain>	in this case no.

Aug 24 10:02:58 <Tazmain>	A css profile might work
Aug 24 16:45:18 <juacado>	Hi Amis, did you solve your problem with code completion?
Aug 24 19:37:56 <ISmithers>	Does anyone here use Eclipse to connect to Salesforce orgs via the Force.com plugin?
Aug 25 00:59:24 <Amis>	juacado, nope
Aug 25 00:59:58 <Amis>	juacado, regardig your last question: do you have problems with, for example, std::shraed_ptr being underlined in red but the code still compiles succesfully?
Aug 25 01:00:26 <Amis>	No, I had to set some defines and flags here and there in eclipse to make it work but it knows C++11 now
Aug 25 03:57:46 <juacado>	same as me Amis, it's a bit annoying that it doesn't work just by adding -std=c++11 to the compiler options
Aug 25 04:01:06 <juacado>	in my case the application compiles succesfully and can be launched, the annoying thing is that I get that red line under shared_ptr and an error message saying that Symbol couldn't be resolved
Aug 25 04:13:27 <Amis>	juacado, you have to configure C++11 in the indexer aswell

Aug 25 05:44:03 <dethegeek>	Hi all
Aug 25 05:45:09 <dethegeek>	I switched to Ecliose Neon a few weeks ago, and I noticed I can no longer split the editor view to show 2 different files side by side
Aug 25 09:26:58 <jablo>	In Eclipse-neon the button to terminate a running build (make) seems to be gone!?!??!?
Aug 25 09:30:41 <mvvvv>	jablo, And with the "Task" view ?
Aug 25 09:31:51 <jablo>	He - right now I am stuck with a modal window saying "User Operation is Waiting"... and no way to stop the running build (which is long). I am thinking of going to the command line and "killall eclipse"
Aug 25 09:34:44 <mvvvv>	what is the eclipse package you use ?
Aug 25 09:35:48 <jablo>	Eclipse CDT - strangely enough, now the button is back (the progress window). Hmmm.
Aug 25 09:39:01 <mvvvv>	jablo, may be this can help :http://kaloyanraev.blogspot.fr/2016/04/why-does-building-workspace-block.html
Aug 25 09:39:12 <jablo>	Yes - now again, doing a "build project", I cannot stop the build from the "Progress" tab. The red stop button is gone again.
Aug 25 09:41:15 <jablo>	very annoying
Aug 25 09:41:28 <mvvvv>	what about the link I gave you
Aug 25 09:41:30 <mvvvv>	?
Aug 25 09:42:43 <jablo>	Well, that would help for the situation I was in - except that since I am working in C++, it makes sense to wait for builders. Normally I would be able to *stop* the build from that dialog, which is fine. But now in Neon it seems not possible.
Aug 25 09:43:27 <jablo>	Oh, now suddenly after quite a while, the res "stop" button is back on the progress tab. Odd.
Aug 25 09:44:06 <mvvvv>	what is the value in preferences/ Run Debug / Launching/ Wait for ongoing build .... ?
Aug 25 09:45:12 <jablo>	"Never"
Aug 25 09:45:21 <mvvvv>	so ... Prompt ?
Aug 25 09:46:52 <jablo>	Hmm - my goal really is to be able to stop a running build.
Aug 25 09:47:08 <mvvvv>	and with prompt ?
Aug 25 09:47:29 <jablo>	mvvv, LOL - alright alright - :-D
Aug 25 09:47:38 <mvvvv>	^_^
Aug 25 09:49:01 <jablo>	Then the red "Stop" button seems to be consistently there in the Progress tab from the start of my build. Nice.

Aug 29 11:06:40 <mistria>	Lone_Rifle mvvvv: https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ecafaq.php , the Eclipse contributor License agreement has to be signed on the Eclipse Profile page https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/myaccount.php#open_tab_cla
Aug 29 11:07:49 <mvvvv>	mistria For Github ??
Aug 29 11:08:32 <mistria>	mvvvv: I believe so, IIRC, Eclipse adds an additional IP check which verifies one has signed the Eclipse Contributor Agreement
Aug 29 11:08:50 <mistria>	mvvvv: it's reported like a test pass or failure
Aug 29 11:10:01 <mistria>	mvvvvv: see https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/2234 for an example, the "ip-validation" at the bottom
Aug 29 11:10:16 <mistria>	mvvvv: though this one is not about ECA
Aug 29 11:12:41 <enleeten>	could it be something with that new contributor agreement?
Aug 29 11:13:59 <enleeten>	nm missed the bottom comments due to scrollback
Aug 29 12:24:42 <TML>	Is there a way to make "Eclipse Intaller.app" use my existing, fully functional JDK instead of looking for Apple's unsupported, legacy 1.6 JDK?
Aug 29 15:40:52 <purplex88>	In Eclipse Java, If I type 'S' it brings up a long autocomplete list of stuff that starts with 'S' and when I press backspace to delete 'S' the autocomplete list doesn't go away.
Aug 29 15:41:28 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Press Escape.
Aug 29 15:42:31 <purplex88>	can i make it work with backpace?
Aug 29 15:42:45 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: No.
Aug 29 15:42:49 <purplex88>	list still being there seems unnecessary if i delete it
Aug 29 15:45:39 <nitind>	Did you set it to automatically show the list when you type 'S'?
Aug 29 15:47:11 <purplex88>	i have set all the alphabetic characters under Windows menu -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Content assist
Aug 29 20:36:47 <Keitaro>	hello is there anybody here plz ?
Aug 29 20:37:30 <Keitaro>	i have a problem on eclipse when i try to build the project it said : cannot find -lpthread
Aug 29 20:37:33 <IstiCusi>	Keitaro: yes
Aug 29 20:38:03 <Keitaro>	c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/5.3.0/../../../../mingw32/bin/ld.exe: cannot find -lpthread
Aug 29 20:38:10 <Keitaro>	i don't know why
Aug 29 20:38:35 <IstiCusi>	sorry, no idea
Aug 29 20:38:38 <Keitaro>	i install mingw with the installer and use eclipse last version for C/C++ dev
Aug 29 20:39:06 <Keitaro>	if i am on windows 64 bit mingw 32 bit works ?
Aug 29 20:39:15 <Keitaro>	or did i have to take the 64 one ?
Aug 30 07:47:05 <greenit>	hi, i have two folders which have identical things in it. one is a svn-synchronized folder, the other one is a linked folder to a share. I need both to be on the same state. is it somehow possible to automatically get all changes i make in one of the folders in the other one too?
Aug 30 07:47:25 <greenit>	both are imported into eclipse
Aug 30 08:42:30 <sasadw4748>	hello?

Sep 01 11:08:11 <Gamoder_>	Hi everyone, is there a way to find out whether eclipse has "crashed" or just takes a long time when editing java files?
Sep 01 11:08:54 <nitind>	~hang
Sep 01 11:08:54 <Arbalest>	In a deadlock or curious what's eating up CPU? http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/How_to_report_a_deadlock
Sep 01 11:10:49 <Gamoder_>	well, it is in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.parser.Scanner
Sep 01 11:11:22 <Gamoder_>	more specifically, in the constructor (probably, it is called <init>)
Sep 01 11:12:44 <Gamoder_>	here is the threaddump: http://pastebin.com/bMjyV1gj
Sep 01 11:15:14 <Gamoder_>	argh, it even happens without code completion
Sep 01 11:17:38 <Gamoder_>	Probably lambdas are the problem
Sep 01 11:17:53 <Gamoder_>	I am using eclipse mars and the support doesn't seem good. If I remove the Lambda, it is ok
Sep 01 11:21:42 <nitind>	What happens with Neon?
Sep 01 11:23:44 <Gamoder_>	don't know, haven't tried it yet
Sep 01 15:05:16 <badloop>	is it possible to launch just any old application in a generic tab in eclipse somehow?
Sep 01 16:03:26 <hanshenrik>	when Neon says it needs the path to a Java 1.8+ VM, does it really mean an ancient jre 1.x release, meaning that my open-jdk 7u111 should suffice, or does it mean something else, like java 8~?
Sep 01 16:03:46 <hanshenrik>	(Neon installer)
Sep 01 16:08:44 <badloop>	hanshenrik: it means java 8
Sep 01 16:08:55 <badloop>	1.8 is the actual release number
Sep 01 16:10:39 <nitind>	"Java 8" is branding.
Sep 01 16:14:37 <hanshenrik>	oh kk
Sep 01 20:44:54 <zave>	could someone give me a definitive link to where one can download the bpmn diagram editor for eclipse (mars.2)?
Sep 01 20:45:37 <zave>	i've been trying this one: http://download.eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler/updates/mars/1.2.4/, but i keep getting an unknown host error.
Sep 01 21:03:39 <Smarticles101>	quick question...  what are the recommended requirements for eclipse?
Sep 01 21:46:20 <hanshenrik_>	over 9001 ghz everything
Sep 01 21:46:57 <hanshenrik_>	j/k, but eclipse is known for being really slow compared to other IDE's
Sep 01 21:48:36 <hanshenrik_>	(meanwhile i use a high-end system, so i don't really notice. i guess most eclipse core devs do too)
Sep 02 03:11:28 <chele>	hi there, how do i remove this exception: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.internal.core.dom.binding.VariableBinding cannot be cast to org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.core.dom.IFunctionBinding . it continuously pops up a window which makes the experience of using eclipse unpleasant.
Sep 02 03:12:32 <chele>	the whole trace http://paste.debian.net/803247/ btw i am using eclipse neon
Sep 02 03:15:59 <mvvvv>	chele, Have a look to this : https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=496749

Sep 04 19:37:23 <al_nz1>	so when I create a new java project in eclipse, there is /src/main/java and /src/test/java - I can understand the main folder structure,but why is a /test/ one getting created?
Sep 04 19:39:05 <davidmichaelkarr>	al_nz1: to encourage you to write unit tests.
Sep 04 19:46:25 <al_nz1>	ok, I will google and read up on it
Sep 04 20:07:55 <al_nz1>	I am trying to follow this tutorial : http://www.mkyong.com/webservices/jax-rs/jersey-hello-world-example/ - but since I am using Java (I think with the M2 plugin) I am not using the commandlines

Sep 04 23:26:59 <jancoow>	Hi there. I want to move from coocox to eclipse. However, coocox works a little bit strange.
Sep 04 23:27:30 <jancoow>	Every directory in the coocox project is linked to "/"
Sep 04 23:28:02 <jancoow>	So, if i have a file in /test/test.c and i want to include it in main.c i have to type include test.c instead of /test/test.c
Sep 04 23:28:08 <jancoow>	Is this also possible in eclipse?
Sep 04 23:57:32 <jeen>	jancoow, I'm not a C developer but I think you might be able to configure a project's build paths to achieve that. In project -> configuration, at a guess.
Sep 05 00:01:54 <jancoow>	jeen: yeah well c usually doesnt have folders, it more catogorisation of files
Sep 05 00:02:06 <jancoow>	so do i need to set every directory as build path
Sep 05 00:02:13 <jancoow>	or what is the different with source folder?
Sep 05 00:03:24 <TheChubu>	also eclipse works fine with links
Sep 05 00:03:57 <TheChubu>	you can set it up to copy the linked file, or to link to the folder, or just make your own system links in whatever os you use
Sep 05 00:07:10 <jancoow>	meh that won't work
Sep 05 00:26:07 <jancoow>	okay beside the include fact it won't compile in ecilpse, ugh
Sep 05 01:29:31 <jvava>	dear, im trying to play a javascript project in eclipse neon,   all ok, but there are many error/warning for node_module, which i notice is excluded. does you met this issue?
Sep 05 02:23:18 <jvava>	jsdt, error/warning, node_modules !!!!
Sep 05 02:24:03 <davidmichaelkarr>	jvava: You're going to have to be more specific.  Exclamation points without showing any real information doesn't help.
Sep 05 02:24:35 <jvava>	ok, let me say in detail
Sep 05 02:26:59 <jvava>	i have a javascript project with npm management,  in eclipse neon, though i check and foudn node_modules directory is excluded from include path,  but validator still report error/warning for the node_moduels, that is just boring. please help.
Sep 05 02:27:44 <davidmichaelkarr>	Well, if pages are trying to include files in node_modules, and you have it excluded, then you should probably change that.
Sep 05 02:28:22 <davidmichaelkarr>	jvava: And you still haven't told us what those errors or warnings are.
Sep 05 02:29:44 <jvava>	1. Duplicate key 'a'  2. Expected value  3. illegal return statement
Sep 05 02:30:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	jvava: Can't tell anything from those.
Sep 05 02:30:41 <jvava>	davidmichaelkarr,  in node_module directory, there are chance test file exist,
Sep 05 02:32:09 <jvava>	even though no test file, maybe a old/third library conflicted with new grammar but can run, so i need exclude that from validator
Sep 05 02:33:39 <jvava>	so i need not see the red error/warning,
Sep 05 02:57:56 <jvava>	who is in charge of the jsdt development,  i have question for you
Sep 05 05:35:07 <jvava>	hi

Sep 05 20:44:09 <davidmichaelkarr>	jancoow1: if you're not using a c++ compiler, it won't be defined.
Sep 06 00:41:21 <metaspike>	hi! I want to work on a remote project with eclipse, is there a agnostic way to do this through ssh?
Sep 06 00:42:11 <metaspike>	or, a 'general way' rather, eg. remote project can be of any project type, but I can load that project into eclipse from remote fs
Sep 06 00:42:27 <metaspike>	and -not- through sshfs :) this is really slow
Sep 06 00:43:10 <metaspike>	I was looking at PTP, but it seems to be specific to C++ / java
Sep 06 00:45:59 <metaspike>	and installing it didn't provide the expected New > Other > Syncronized Project thing anyway so. stumped
Sep 06 02:21:11 <al_nz1>	Why when I add the jars to /WEB-INF/lib do are my imports not recognised?
Sep 06 02:57:08 <al_nz1>	can somebody please help me out trying to follow this tutorial http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/REST/article.html
Sep 06 02:57:17 <al_nz1>	when I try to run my project I get :
Sep 06 02:57:33 <al_nz1>	Servlet [Jersey REST Service] in web application [/com.vogella.jersey.first] threw load() exception
Sep 06 02:57:34 <al_nz1>	java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer
Sep 06 03:19:09 <mistria>	al_nz1: consider using JBoss Tools, it may help
Sep 06 03:22:03 <al_nz1>	mistria: ok, I will take a look, but finding it really frustrating to not be able to follow a darn tutorial
Sep 06 03:22:20 <al_nz1>	I am using maven so all the deps stuff should be handled
Sep 06 03:25:33 <mistria>	al_nz1: there are some deps that are assumed to be "provided" by the JEE server
Sep 06 03:25:56 <mistria>	al_nz1: also, maybe your server isn't using Jersey for Jax-RS
Sep 06 03:26:12 <al_nz1>	Its tomcat. How would I check?
Sep 06 03:26:19 <mistria>	al_nz1: if you tell Maven that dep is provided, but it's not; then it ends up being missing
Sep 06 03:26:37 <mistria>	al_nz1: I don't know, I rarely use Tomcat (exactly for this kind of reasons)
Sep 06 03:27:15 <al_nz1>	sure looks provided : https://snag.gy/pUXncy.jpg
Sep 06 03:28:16 <mistria>	al_nz1: whether the dependency gets included or not in your app depends on the Maven scope
Sep 06 03:28:21 <al_nz1>	oh yep, fair enough, though this doenst look like a tomcat issue
Sep 06 03:28:42 <al_nz1>	dont supose you would be interested in taking a look at my screen?
Sep 06 03:28:48 <mistria>	al_nz1: it is an integration issue , that you have specifically because you're using Tomcat ;)
Sep 06 03:28:52 <al_nz1>	i have wasted two days on this
Sep 06 03:29:10 <mistria>	al_nz1: if you were using a real JEE server, Jax-RS is embedded and usually working better (that's JEE spec)
Sep 06 03:29:46 <al_nz1>	a real JEE server being?
Sep 06 03:32:11 <mistria>	al_nz1: WildFly
Sep 06 03:33:07 <mistria>	al_nz1: or any of http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/compatibility-jsp-136984.html
Sep 06 03:34:28 <al_nz1>	so glassfish, wildfly, tomcat, jetty are all JEE servers?
Sep 06 03:42:46 <mistria>	tomcat and jetty are not full JEE servers
Sep 06 03:42:58 <mistria>	they do not implement the Jax-RS specification for example
Sep 06 03:43:08 <mistria>	they only implement the Servlet one and a few others
Sep 06 03:44:41 <mistria>	al_nz1: basically with Tomcat, if you want Jax-RS you have to add it by yourself (and deal with potential integration issues), if you use Wildfly, it's there, tested and certified as working
Sep 06 03:53:35 <purplex88>	why the user dictionary is not working?
Sep 06 03:54:28 <purplex88>	I right click on the word > Add to dictionary
Sep 06 03:54:56 <purplex88>	It brings a preference dialog where i set the path to user defined dictionary and click ok
Sep 06 03:55:24 <purplex88>	After that it doesn't add the word
Sep 06 04:03:32 <mistria>	purplex88: does your user defined dictionary contain the word? Maybe you have to close your editor and open it again.
Sep 06 04:04:44 <purplex88>	mistria: the file is not even created
Sep 06 04:05:19 <purplex88>	i specified: "mydic.txt" in eclipse folder
Sep 06 04:05:41 <mistria>	purplex88: I believe it's your responsibility to create the file (and maybe even edit it), the action name may be misleading
Sep 06 04:06:05 <purplex88>	even edit it?
Sep 06 04:06:40 <mistria>	purplex88: maybe, I don't know, I don't use it
Sep 06 04:07:00 <purplex88>	it action clearly says "Add <word> to dictionary"
Sep 06 04:27:45 <mistria>	purplex88: well, you tried, it doesn't do what it says. So it's most likely a bug (in the action or its name)
Sep 06 04:27:53 <mistria>	purplex88: http://bugs.eclipse.org
Sep 06 04:52:02 <purplex88>	Really?
Sep 06 04:53:03 <purplex88>	How can this bug still be there? It should have been fixed since its a very function
Sep 06 04:53:11 <purplex88>	basic function*
Sep 06 04:55:18 <mistria>	purplex88: it's probably still here because no-one reported it previously
Sep 06 04:55:36 <mistria>	purplex88: and not many people use care about spelling in the Eclipse IDE
Sep 06 04:55:46 <purplex88>	or no one uses dictionary lol
Sep 06 04:55:50 <mistria>	purplex88: it's the kind of things that's easily unnoticed
Sep 06 07:54:30 <Ben_1>	hi

Sep 08 09:10:12 <lyubenblagoev>	Hello everybody, I'm having an issue with Eclipse "Next Editor" and "Previous Editor" commands (those commands are bound to Ctrl+F6 and Shift+Ctrl+F6 by default). I'm running it on Linux with Gnome 3.20. Both commands don't work even after I changed the default key binding. Does anyone else have the same issue?
Sep 08 09:11:26 <lyubenblagoev>	I've tried them on a Windows VM that I have and both commands work. I also googled for similar issues but all issues I found are too old.
Sep 08 11:56:50 <davidmichaelkarr>	Wow, m2e is really aggravating me. For some reason, when I do "update project" on a particular project, it keeps on replacing my JDK 1.8 library with a JDK 1.5 library, and then because of that fails facet constraints and other things. I can't figure out what is making it do this.
Sep 08 12:01:33 <davidmichaelkarr>	Ok. Figured it out. I didn't have a "maven-compiler-plugin" config for that project (it actually is just a html/javascript war, with no java), so apparently that was making it default to 1.5.  I just added the missing config and now it isn't losing its mind.
Sep 08 13:49:53 <davidmichaelkarr>	Sigh. The Tomcat server config in Eclipse is fragile. It can just start failing for no obvious reason. The only fix I've found is to recreate the server def and copy in all my required settings, and then it just works fine again. Annoying.
Sep 08 14:41:13 <nitind>	Do you have logs of the failures?
Sep 08 14:54:39 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: yes, but it doesn't really tell me anything.  It tells me that it couldn't find the class.  Duh.  You told me that already. :)
Sep 08 14:55:13 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: "you" being Eclipse, obviously.
Sep 08 14:57:06 <davidmichaelkarr>	lyubenblagoev: If you're still around, by "don't work", do you mean that pressing the key doesn't appear to execute the desired function?  Do you see any binding conflicts in the Eclipse log file?
Sep 08 17:23:42 <n3m0>	Hi there! I have a question regarding the neon/mars releases: How can I add flags for the building to projects?
Sep 08 17:33:31 <n3m0>	I am more specifically struggling on how to set it up in order to link libraries
Sep 08 17:36:58 <n3m0>	And I guess I should add that I use eclipse for c++ development
Sep 09 01:49:06 <lyubenblagoev>	davidmichaelkarr: I don't see any conflicts at least in the keys dialog. I tried to change it to another key combinations without effect. When I press the keys nothing happens (usually a list of editors is shown and on every subsequent keypres the selection in the list is changed). After pressing the keys multiple times the list appears but I cannot select anything except with the mouse but the active editor doesn't change.
Sep 09 01:49:53 <lyubenblagoev>	That happened when I changed the keybinding to Ctrl + Shift + ] and i hold Ctrl + Shift while pressing multiple times ]
Sep 09 02:29:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	lyubenblagoev: I'm guessing this isn't a binding problem per se.  Can you press Ctrl+shift+l (ell), which should list current key bindings, and then scroll down to "Next Editor" and press enter on that?
Sep 09 02:35:13 <lyubenblagoev>	davidmichaelkarr, I also think this isn't a binding problem.
Sep 09 02:35:32 <lyubenblagoev>	I tried what you suggested and the editors list popped up
Sep 09 02:35:49 <lyubenblagoev>	but I can't scroll and select any items in it
Sep 09 02:35:59 <lyubenblagoev>	I can select only with mouse
Sep 09 02:36:07 <lyubenblagoev>	and this doesn't change the current editor
Sep 09 02:36:28 <lyubenblagoev>	Ctrl+F8 (next perspective) also doesn't work for me
Sep 09 02:42:46 <davidmichaelkarr>	lyubenblagoev: What platform are you on?
Sep 09 02:44:18 <davidmichaelkarr>	lyubenblagoev: And have you inspected the eclipse log yet?
Sep 09 02:45:40 <lyubenblagoev>	davidmichaelkarr, I'm on Arch Linux with Gnome 3.20.2 with Eclipse Neon
Sep 09 02:45:52 <lyubenblagoev>	davidmichaelkarr, I wrote that in my first message
Sep 09 02:46:25 <lyubenblagoev>	I'm currently tailing the output of workspace/.metadata/.log but no messages are logged there when I try to switch editors or perspectives
Sep 09 02:47:09 <davidmichaelkarr>	lyubenblagoev: I know that Ubuntu has issues with GTK3, I have no idea if that platform would have issues with it. Have you attempted to turn off GTK3?
Sep 09 02:49:48 <lyubenblagoev>	davidmichaelkarr, yes, I've already turned GTK3 off and using GTK2
Sep 09 02:59:16 <lyubenblagoev>	Is there anyone else using Linux to confirm whether or not he or she is having the same issues as me?
Sep 09 03:02:49 <mvvvv>	lyubenblagoev, can you repost your problem ?
Sep 09 03:08:27 <lyubenblagoev>	mvvvv, I'm having an issue with Eclipse "Next Editor" and "Previous Editor" commands (those commands are bound to Ctrl+F6 and Shift+Ctrl+F6 by default). I'm running it on Linux with Gnome 3.20. Both commands don't work even after I changed the default key binding. The Next Perspective (Ctrl+F8) also doesn't seem to work.
Sep 09 03:09:47 <lyubenblagoev>	I've set Ctrl+Tab and Shift+Ctrl+Tab to the Next Tab / Previous Tab bindings and they do work, but I want to be able to go to the previously opened tab, while Previous / Next Tab go to the tab before or after the currently opened tab.
Sep 09 03:12:21 <lyubenblagoev>	I found the following in the Eclipse Bugzilla: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=474449
Sep 09 03:12:35 <lyubenblagoev>	but it doesn't seem to be resolved yet
Sep 09 03:13:06 <lyubenblagoev>	probably I'm hitting the same issue
Sep 09 03:16:30 <mvvvv>	looks like gnome do not release ctrl+f6
Sep 09 03:19:48 <mvvvv>	Don't you have a gnome-shell extension using these shortcuts ?
Sep 09 03:20:18 <lyubenblagoev>	mvvvv, no I don't
Sep 09 03:20:46 <lyubenblagoev>	mvvvv, I've also remapped to different keys and still doesn't work
Sep 09 03:21:24 <davidmichaelkarr>	lyubenblagoev: Considering it still behaved strangely when you executed it directly from the bindings list, it's not just a binding problem.
Sep 09 03:24:15 <lyubenblagoev>	davidmichaelkarr, agree. It's not the binding
Sep 09 05:02:41 <mvvvv>	lyubenblagoev, I'm testing on gnome-shell 20 (ubuntu version) I do not have the problem
Sep 09 05:03:22 <lyubenblagoev>	mvvvv, thank you for testing this
Sep 09 08:12:15 <hanshenrik>	i think i found a bug in 4.6.0; the start page has this "Review IDE configuration settings: Review the IDE's most fiercely contested preferences" , that thing may be slow to respond when clicked on, which might prompt the user to click on it several times before it opens. then, when it first actually opens, it opens a window for every time the user clicked on it. clicked on it 10 times? it opens 10 copies of the window. pretty sure
Sep 09 08:12:15 <hanshenrik>	that's not supposed to happen

Sep 13 11:04:12 <caturday>	hello all
Sep 13 11:04:24 <fares>	hey guys this will seem silly but whenever I press on a line, the entire line is highlighted... do u know how to fix this?
Sep 13 11:04:56 <caturday>	i've got a dynamic web module project with some jsps and a custom jstl taglib
Sep 13 11:06:08 <caturday>	for whatever reason, every time i maven rebuild the project, all of my custom tags with references to the taglib they're in cause "can not find the tag library descriptor for /path/to/tag/lib"
Sep 13 11:06:23 <caturday>	errors, specifically on the @taglib lnie
Sep 13 11:06:25 <caturday>	line*
Sep 13 11:06:45 <caturday>	and then /eventually/ those errors go away
Sep 13 11:06:50 <caturday>	but after quite a bit of time
Sep 13 11:07:44 <caturday>	i figure this has to be some weird discrepency between what maven has built and the eclipse jsp validator
Sep 13 11:08:02 <caturday>	the strange thing is that this doesn't happen in any of my jsps with references to the same taglib
Sep 13 11:08:06 <caturday>	only the tags within
Sep 13 11:11:55 <fares>	nevermind got it to work...
Sep 13 11:19:36 <nitind>	caturday: Not sure I understand what you mean. You're talking about tag files?
Sep 13 11:19:59 <caturday>	yeah
Sep 13 11:20:11 <caturday>	so i've got tag files defined as part of a taglib
Sep 13 11:20:30 <nitind>	And they have taglib directives in them themselves?
Sep 13 11:21:08 <caturday>	i'm willing to admit that this might be misunderstanding on my part, but... yes
Sep 13 11:21:13 <caturday>	references to their own taglib
Sep 13 11:21:25 <caturday>	because some of the tags are composed of other tags in the same library
Sep 13 11:32:22 <nitind>	I think it's a bug. In http://git.eclipse.org/c/sourceediting/webtools.sourceediting.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.jst.jsp.core/src/org/eclipse/jst/jsp/core/internal/taglib/TaglibHelperManager.java#n120 .  I've added a note to ~421146 .

Sep 13 11:39:14 <caturday>	thanks, nitind
Sep 13 15:38:32 <ipun>	Hi, is there a method to check if eclipse is currently themed?
Sep 13 17:06:53 <Kaje>	There is some way to get information about parts in a current workbench, but I can't remember what it is called.
Sep 13 17:07:30 <Kaje>	It is some hot key that will let you select a part in Eclipse and it will tell you a bunch of information about it, such as what bundle it comes from...
Sep 13 17:07:43 <Kaje>	Can someone remind me what I'm thinking of?

Sep 13 21:59:43 <Vivekananda>	hi. anyone knows gradle ?
Sep 13 22:14:36 <promach>	what does the comment in https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&th=1081105&goto=1743172&#msg_1743172 means ?
Sep 13 22:14:48 <promach>	how would I proceed ?
Sep 13 22:55:41 <davidmichaelkarr>	promach: Uh, see if you can build it from the command line outside of Eclipse?
Sep 13 22:56:03 <davidmichaelkarr>	Vivekananda: If you have a question, ask it, but it might be better to ask it on the Gradle Forum site.
Sep 13 22:57:36 <promach>	I think I need to install arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc
Sep 13 23:00:15 <Vivekananda>	davidmichaelkarr, if there is an irc channel on a different server for gradle please let me know. My question is I have separate gradle projects ( ie separated folders each with a gradle.build file) for lessons in java collections tutorial. I wanted to import all folders in one superfolder and then work on those. But on doing it the gradle.build files give an error on trying to build: The folder 'superfolder' is not
Sep 13 23:00:15 <Vivekananda>	backed by gradle. So how do I do this ?
Sep 13 23:04:15 <davidmichaelkarr>	Vivekananda: There is #gradle, but I'm saying you'll get a better response on the Gradle Forum site, not IRC.
Sep 13 23:04:36 <Vivekananda>	hmm ok
Sep 14 02:12:03 <tippy>	hey all
Sep 14 02:12:55 <tippy>	I'm getting the unhandled event error, and I've tried all the fixes
Sep 14 02:16:57 <promach>	davidmichaelkarr: I have already installed arch-linux package for ARM cross-compile libraries (arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc) an restarted Xilinx SDK. I can build it outside eclipse with only command line gcc. However, I still have unresolved inclusion for stdio.h
Sep 14 03:40:08 <Stummi>	Quick question: is there any way to easily find out which preferences option provided a particular color used in the editor? I am using a dark theme, some editors still use dark colors for some parts of the syntax highlighting and I often find myself having a hard time figuring out where to change this color
Sep 14 03:52:17 <mvvvv>	Stummi, I'm afraid it's still a mess to find the right one
Sep 14 04:34:59 <Anticom>	Hi all. I'm running Eclipse Luna CDT on Linux. I was wondering, whether it was possible to configure it to properly build an autotools based project. I couldn't find anything online concerning this
Sep 14 04:40:25 <Anticom>	oh nvm, found it
Sep 14 05:00:48 <Velho>	Why's a maven project so hard to setup on Eclipse?
Sep 14 05:09:49 <Anticom>	Hm, that's really weird. I've installed eclipse cdt from the official ubuntu sources now (for whatever reason it's only v3.8.1). There's no gnu autotools option aswell

Sep 14 12:33:09 <loganrun>	is there any way to fix this
Sep 14 12:34:48 <mvvvv>	loganrun, what's the message when you launch it from command line ?
Sep 14 12:37:17 <loganrun>	don't see any message
Sep 14 12:37:43 <loganrun>	OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: ignoring option MaxPermSize=256m; support was removed in 8.0
Sep 14 12:38:28 <loganrun>	is there a way to force a scan for plugins
Sep 14 12:39:03 <davidmichaelkarr>	loganrun: You mean updates for them?  Just do "Help"->"Check for updates".
Sep 14 12:39:29 <loganrun>	no trying to figure out why pydev won't show up after I install it
Sep 14 12:40:48 <loganrun>	is there a way to run it manually or figure out whatversion of java it is using
Sep 14 12:42:21 <loganrun>	I am thinking it may be using some ancient version of java or something
Sep 14 12:46:55 <loganrun>	anybody know why eclipse doesn't reconize the pydev plugin
Sep 14 12:48:17 <mvvvv>	you're using openjdk 8 (or above)
Sep 14 12:49:42 <mvvvv>	do you have a workspace created or not ?
Sep 14 12:50:13 <loganrun>	yes using openjdk 8, tried installing 9 but eclipse just crashes
Sep 14 12:50:55 <loganrun>	so if I go to about eclipse it shows pydev for eclipse 5.2.0.20168171824
Sep 14 12:51:15 <loganrun>	  PyDev for Eclipse	5.2.0.201608171824	org.python.pydev.feature.feature.group	Fabio Zadrozny
Sep 14 12:52:15 <loganrun>	when I do the updates it presuably puts them in ~/.eclipse/
Sep 14 12:52:34 <loganrun>	but it seems like the module does't really do anything
Sep 14 12:52:55 <mvvvv>	so liclipse is running but you don't see the ? editor ?
Sep 14 12:53:35 <loganrun>	I don't see pydev perspective etc.
Sep 14 12:53:44 <loganrun>	eclipse seems to work fine otherwise
Sep 14 12:54:01 <mvvvv>	how did you downloaded pydev ?
Sep 14 12:55:27 <mvvvv>	sorry I have to quit
Sep 14 12:55:33 <loganrun>	from install software: PyDev - http://pydev.org/updates
Sep 14 12:55:46 <loganrun>	from within eclipse
Sep 14 12:55:55 <loganrun>	is it getting the wrong version or something
Sep 14 12:57:25 <loganrun>	is there an error log or something
Sep 14 13:02:30 <davidmichaelkarr>	loganrun: There's an Eclipse log at .metadata/.log , in your workspace.

Sep 15 03:58:41 <Anticom>	Hi all. I'm currently maintaining a legacy project where no build files exist but it is only buildable with eclipse CDT. Now in the project settings where the GCC tools are configured i see "${workspace_loc:/foo/bar}". How is ${workspace_loc:/path} different from ${workspace_loc}/path ?
Sep 15 04:01:43 <mvvvv>	they are two different variables : http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fconcepts-exttools.htm
Sep 15 04:04:08 <Anticom>	mvvvv: I just also noticed in the link you gave me there was project_loc... I've been using ProjDirPath for quite some time... Is this obsolete?
Sep 15 04:04:26 <Anticom>	Because from what i see they should point to the same path, shouldn't they?
Sep 15 04:07:32 <mvvvv>	looks like a variable added by some tools. Don't know it
Sep 15 04:10:59 <mvvvv>	no it's in the list of variable for cdt (see Pref / C++ build / Build variables)
Sep 15 04:11:53 <mvvvv>	using project proterties you can add this variable to your project variable list
Sep 15 05:04:03 <Anticom>	Hi all. I'm running Eclipse CDT (3.8.1) on Ubuntu. I've enabled "CDT GCC Built-in Compiler Settings" Provider in "C/C++ General" > "Preprocessor Includes" and triggered an Indexer rebuilt but it still fails to find standard headers like <string>, <iostream> or3rd party libraries like <boost/filesystem/path.hpp>
Sep 15 05:04:06 <Anticom>	What am i missing?
Sep 15 05:05:35 <mvvvv>	Anticom, don't use the old eclipse from ubuntu is outdated
Sep 15 05:07:33 <Anticom>	mvvvv: My VM runs ubuntu 14.04 LTS and i hadn't much luck installing eclipse neon because of jdk8
Sep 15 05:08:00 <Anticom>	I've got default-jre installed
Sep 15 05:08:51 <Anticom>	Any suggestions?
Sep 15 05:09:32 <mvvvv>	Anticom, http://www.webupd8.org/2012/09/install-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-via-ppa.html
Sep 15 05:12:05 <Anticom>	Hm, i'd rather go for openjdk. According to (german) ubuntu wiki there's a ppa for it aswell: ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
Sep 15 05:15:32 <mvvvv>	you may also have a problem with gtk3 : export SWT_GTK3=0   before launching eclipse
Sep 15 05:48:51 <Anticom>	mvvvv: Okay i've upgraded to eclipse neon but the problem still resides
Sep 15 05:51:06 <mvvvv>	Anticom, did you create a new project or is it an old one imported ?
Sep 15 05:51:08 <Anticom>	Oh wait, think i've figured it out. The indexer was using a (currently) broken build config. Didn't know you could specify which one the indexer should use.
Sep 15 05:51:16 <Anticom>	mvvvv: it's an old imported one
Sep 15 05:51:25 <Anticom>	Indexer is currently doing a refresh
Sep 15 05:51:51 <Anticom>	Yep, that was the issue
Sep 15 07:09:26 <jrtappers>	Is there a best class to extend if I want to make my own IDocument that is just like the default one, just with added methods
Sep 15 09:53:46 <Anticom>	My eclipse neon suddenly started opening and switching tabs randomly
Sep 15 09:54:11 <Anticom>	Like i did some edit and wanted to save and before i was able to it switched to another tab
Sep 15 09:54:17 <Anticom>	Is this a known problem?
Sep 15 10:00:37 <davidmichaelkarr>	Anticom: platform?
Sep 15 10:09:01 <mvvvv>	davidmichaelkarr, I think it's ubuntu 14.04
Sep 15 10:19:02 <davidmichaelkarr>	Make sure gtk3 is turned off.
Sep 15 10:19:41 <davidmichaelkarr>	Anticom: make sure gtk3 is turned off.
Sep 15 10:21:36 <Anticom>	Can i do this in eclipse.ini or do i have to do this via environment?
Sep 15 10:21:43 <Anticom>	^ davidmichaelkarr
Sep 15 11:33:56 <altendky>	i would like to have a build option that does not get committed and is 'easily' accessible in the gui.  we revision control .project and .cproject presently.  for context, the option would build the embedded application such that it uses defaults rather than loading saved parameters.  does eclipse provide a feature for this?
Sep 15 12:42:26 <bgunter>	i think the virgo website might have been compromised
Sep 15 12:42:42 <bgunter>	i'm browsing the docks and i keep getting popup windows that go to URLs like this
Sep 15 12:42:48 <bgunter>	*docs
Sep 15 12:42:52 <bgunter>	http://quickdomainfwd.com/?dn=loopfuse.net&pid=9PO755G95
Sep 15 12:47:56 <bgunter>	example of a page that gave me that popup when i clicked a link http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/documentation/virgo-documentation-3.7.0.M01/docs/virgo-user-guide/html/ch01.html#d0e102
Sep 15 12:52:51 <purplex88>	whats the latest stable eclipse IDE?
Sep 15 12:54:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Neon (4.6.0).
Sep 15 12:54:45 <purplex88>	can't find 4.6 here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/all
Sep 15 12:56:02 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Site seems a little confused right now. Not sure what's going on there.
Sep 15 12:56:45 <purplex88>	well it doesn't number any of releases
Sep 15 12:57:09 <purplex88>	all i see is m1, m2, m3.. RC etc
Sep 15 12:57:46 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Yes, I can see that.  It's broken.  I don't know what's wrong.  You can normally just click the "Download" link at https://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php , but that's broken also.
Sep 15 12:59:33 <purplex88>	is eclipse dying?
Sep 15 13:00:20 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Everything has bugs. I'm sure it will be fixed soon. I believe I noticed they were in the midst of releasing a Neon release candidate, so perhaps someone did something wrong and no one has noticed it yet.
Sep 15 13:01:34 <purplex88>	i guess i will still use Eclipse Mars i downloaded last year
Sep 15 13:07:16 <purplex88>	ok found it here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/
Sep 15 13:07:41 <purplex88>	Neon 4.6 aka. Neon R
Sep 15 13:09:26 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Weird.  I haven't seen that "Neon R" convention before.  I guess the "R" stands for "Release".  I don't get the point of that.
Sep 15 13:11:42 <purplex88>	true, and 'M' in M1, M2 etc is "Milestone".
Sep 15 13:12:35 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Well, yeah, that's well known, and seeing "RC" is also pretty obvious, but it just seems silly to call it "Neon R".
Sep 15 13:13:05 <purplex88>	i guess just stick to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
Sep 15 13:13:47 <purplex88>	yep haven't seen this kind of naming before
Sep 15 13:14:24 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: When that's working.  For me, that just displays "can't open file" below the donations panel.
Sep 15 13:15:36 <purplex88>	hm, you couldn't download it?
Sep 15 13:16:36 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Not that I need to, as I already have it, but as I described, when I click that link right now, it produces a page with the "donations" panel on top of a simple "can't open file" message.  That's the entire page.
Sep 15 13:18:33 <purplex88>	strange.. didn't happen with me, i already downloaded it
Sep 15 13:37:17 <purplex88>	The dictionary now correctly works in neon.
Sep 15 13:37:31 <purplex88>	i couldn't use it at all in mars
Sep 15 13:43:36 FiSHLiM plugin unloaded

Sep 19 10:36:42 <Wallcraft>	Hi all! stupid question , how do i add libraries into WEB-INF/lib folder? If i do "Add External JARs" them will be added into Referenced Libraries folder
Sep 19 11:53:57 <mistria>	Wallcraft: did you try to copy the necessary jars to this folder?
Sep 19 11:54:03 <mistria>	Wallcraft: are you using Maven?
Sep 19 11:55:24 <Wallcraft>	i solved it but i still get some error
Sep 19 11:56:12 <Wallcraft>	mistria: im becoming fool, can you help me to configure Eclipse in the proper way to develop Java EE apps?
Sep 19 11:56:43 <mistria>	Wallcraft: well, all depends on whether you're using Maven or not
Sep 19 11:56:52 <Wallcraft>	no im not using maven
Sep 19 11:56:54 <chibby0ne>	Hey guys, so while I run an SWTBot test using maven (through the tycho-surefire-plugin) I get this weird UI which is not the normal eclipse sdk ide or the platform ide. In fact there's a message saying "!ENTRY org.eclipse.equinox.app !MESSAGE Product org.eclipse.platform.ide could not be found". I doesn't include my plugins/features, and therefore every test fails as it doesn't find the menu entries/icons that I want to test. Do you
Sep 19 11:56:55 <chibby0ne>	guys have any idea why this happens?
Sep 19 11:56:56 <mistria>	Wallcraft: using Maven would be recommended
Sep 19 11:57:38 <mistria>	Wallcraft: if you install JBoss Tools, you have some good help to get started with a Java EE project (and Maven), and good tools for the continuation of your project
Sep 19 11:57:42 <Wallcraft>	i tried to use it, but i dont understand how to use, when i installed and convert my project into maven project i get only error
Sep 19 11:58:37 <mistria>	chibby0ne: is the org.eclipse.platform.ide product available in your target-platform Tycho is using?
Sep 19 11:58:53 <Wallcraft>	Doesn't exist a sort of guide step by step for newbie that introduce to java EE developer and how to configure Eclipse too?
Sep 19 11:59:21 <mistria>	Wallcraft: there are plenty of them, however, I'm not sure which one to recommend
Sep 19 11:59:47 <chibby0ne>	So more specifically: in the <configuration> of tycho-surefire-plugin, I set the <product> to any of the commonly used products when launching but none of them are found. Funny thing is that all the test run perfectly when they are launched as junit test or swtbot test in run configuration menu.
Sep 19 11:59:50 <Wallcraft>	okay thanks anyway!
Sep 19 12:00:26 <mistria>	Wallcraft: this one is good http://developers.redhat.com/ticket-monster/ but I'm not sure it's for Java EE beginners
Sep 19 12:01:03 <mistria>	chibby0ne: that's because the necessary bundles are available in your "Run Configuration" of the IDE
Sep 19 12:01:05 <chibby0ne>	mistria, Yes, the target-definition file used in the target-platform-configuration plugin, basically contained everything from the normal update-sites (mars/neon-release, 4.5/4.6 release)
Sep 19 12:01:33 <mistria>	chibby0ne: ok...
Sep 19 12:02:21 <mistria>	chibby0ne: IIRC, Tycho doesn't automatically find which feature/bundle to add for a given productID, so you probably have to add extra-dependencies to the <configuration> of tycho-surefire-plugin to have the product included
Sep 19 12:02:47 <chibby0ne>	mistria, I'm not using target-platform anymore as I can always let tycho calculate the target-platform. Besides reading the surefire-plugin docs, it says that the OSGI runtime created doesn't contain all the plugins/features included in the target-definition
Sep 19 12:04:06 <mistria>	chibby0ne: yeah, that's fine, so I think you need to add explicitly a dependency to the bundle providing the product with https://eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-surefire/tycho-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#dependencies
Sep 19 12:04:44 <chibby0ne>	mistria, interesting.. I was doing that sort of extra-dependencies but not with the productID directly, I would just add all dependencies from the target-definition file (mainly org.eclipse.platform as eclipse-plugin)
Sep 19 12:05:35 <Wallcraft>	mistria: thanks man
Sep 19 12:06:16 <mistria>	chibby0ne: you shouldn't use the productId as an artifactId, but add explicitly the dependency to the necessary bundle
Sep 19 12:06:47 <mistria>	chibby0ne: but anyway, you should also evaluate why your tests do require a product to work
Sep 19 12:07:41 <mistria>	chibby0ne: usually, you want you code to work in multiple products, so you'd like your plugin and test to run even without a product
Sep 19 12:08:01 <chibby0ne>	mistria, ok I'll try that again more carefully.
Sep 19 12:08:21 <mistria>	chibby0ne: most projects run without the product, using the regular workbench application.
Sep 19 12:08:33 <chibby0ne>	mistria, yeah but with/without a product it just launches a weird ide :(
Sep 19 12:11:37 <chibby0ne>	mistria, actually tbh there's a branding plugin (which I'm not including in the build atm because it doesn't work) but what would be the difference in the approach if I wanted to use swtbot for rcp products? wouldn't that require the product? Also what is the testRuntime=p2Installed. I've tried this ( by using the maven-director and materializing-product goal), and pointing to the work directory to that installation but it also doesn't
Sep 19 12:11:37 <chibby0ne>	find the product :(
Sep 19 12:21:45 <Wallcraft>	mistria: i have always the same problem. When i create a Dynamic Web Project, and i create i servlet, there are many missing import such as: javax.servlet.ServletException
Sep 19 12:22:32 <Wallcraft>	for solve this i always need to import manually JARs file from tomcat9.0/lib folders, there's a way to automatically get libs from tomcat imported?
Sep 19 12:25:53 <mistria>	Wallcraft: IIRC, if you configure a server in the "Servers" view and associate it with the project, the classpath should be augmented to include the JEE jars
Sep 19 12:26:34 <mistria>	chibby0ne: did you look at the log in details, it doesn't tell anything more about not finding product?
Sep 19 12:27:59 <Wallcraft>	i created a Web Project and i associated a tomcat, but when i create servlet the servlet jars are missing
Sep 19 12:33:48 <mistria>	Wallcraft: did you look at help.eclipse.org ?
Sep 19 14:44:41 <TheMontyChrist_>	how do I get eclipse cdt to point to mingw64?
Sep 19 15:01:35 <motaka2>	cant I compile and run a single file in eclipse project using maven ?

Sep 20 10:25:45 <chibby0ne>	mistria, do you know how to get rid of these warnings when launching surefire-test "Could not resolve module: org.eclipse.compare.win32 [309]
Sep 20 10:25:46 <chibby0ne>	  Unresolved requirement: Require-Capability: eclipse.platform; filter:="(osgi.os=win32)"?
Sep 20 10:25:59 <mistria>	chibby0ne: no
Sep 20 10:26:07 <mistria>	chibby0ne: I usually ignore warning
Sep 20 10:28:03 <chibby0ne>	mistria, they seem to be caused by the inclusion of the "org.eclipse.platform" to the dependencies. A similar one also appear for macosx. Funny thing is that I'm running everything in Linux
Sep 20 10:28:51 <chibby0ne>	mistria, but yeah we can just ignore them for the time being
Sep 20 10:40:25 <maybee>	I am back, so right to your questions: 1. I am testing both. Directly starting SWTBot Tests from IDE as well as run them with tycho
Sep 20 10:40:28 <maybee>	does not matter
Sep 20 10:41:15 <maybee>	my plug-in to be tested is definitively loaded as I already triggered it. However, the error or success dialog is not shown at all
Sep 20 10:43:20 <maybee>	I even just started the test in debug mode and manually operate on the started workbench. I can do several things with my plug-in under test. However, JFace error/warning/information dialogs are not shown at all
Sep 20 11:01:15 <chibby0ne>	maybee, mmm interesting, so when NOT running the SWTBot tests the Dialogs are shown, but when using SWTBot tests  (whether through Launch Configuration as SWTBot Test or Maven/Tycho build) they are not shown?
Sep 20 11:02:35 <maybee>	that is, what I am currently observing... yes
Sep 20 11:07:39 <maybee>	I just tried it again. Normally starting a workbench with the plug-in installed yields valid MessageDialogs, but SWTBot tests do not
Sep 20 11:37:37 <mistria>	maybee: your SWTBot test need to always have focus, do you make sure you don't interfer with the test focus when it's running?
Sep 20 11:39:35 <maybee>	mistria: yes, I also do run tests where I do not do anything. not even touch mouse and keyboard. no difference
Sep 20 11:39:54 <maybee>	btw. bot.captureScreenshot also does not work. Any dependency I can miss?
Sep 20 11:56:12 <mistria>	maybee: does your test code use Display.syncExec()? Could it be stuck there?
Sep 20 12:00:56 <maybee>	mistria: not the test code does not use Display.syncExec, but the plug-in's code does. But this should not be an issue, shouldn't it?
Sep 20 12:02:21 <mistria>	maybee: no, it should not; however maybe the test do actually show an issue in the plugin's code
Sep 20 12:04:22 <maybee>	mistria: I actually just tried to debug into the JFace code and start providing different shells as a parent. Also nothing...
Sep 20 12:05:04 <maybee>	Yes, it might be an issue in the plugin's code. However, I do not know which one it could be. Until now, the plugin works fine for years (without testing) :D
Sep 20 12:05:41 <maybee>	So as I am out of ideas, I will try to dive even deeper into the mud of jface code^^
Sep 20 12:08:56 <maybee>	Found it! org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.ErrorDialog:  /** Static to prevent opening of error dialogs for automated testing. */ 	public static boolean AUTOMATED_MODE = false;
Sep 20 12:09:57 <maybee>	This flag is set to true (somewhere) and thus prevents from opening e.g. ErrorDialogs
Sep 20 12:11:29 <maybee>	mistria: So for now, I do not understand what is going on here. Is it set by SWTBot? Can I prevent the test infrastructure from setting this flag?

Sep 20 13:44:41 <quangl>	eclipse is better than netbeans?
Sep 20 13:45:04 <davidmichaelkarr>	quangl: You're going to have to answer that for yourself.
Sep 20 13:46:28 <quangl>	but i never used either
Sep 20 13:46:39 <nitind>	They're both free. So just try them.
Sep 20 13:47:44 <quangl>	ok
Sep 20 13:55:43 <mistria>	quangl: in most cases, Eclipse and NetBeans are equivalent
Sep 20 13:56:08 <mistria>	quangl: Eclipse is more feature-rich, especially if you use 3rd-party extensions from Marketplace
Sep 20 13:57:13 <mistria>	quangl: NetBeans has its advantages too, but you'll have to ask NetBeans supporter as we're all biased in favor of Eclipse here ;)
Sep 20 16:58:17 <nivag>	What's happening with Eclipse 4.6.1?
Sep 20 16:59:31 <nitind>	Still expected a week from tomorrow, AFAIK.

Sep 21 14:12:50 <Newyorkadam>	what does it mean to "switch stacks" using the eclipse debugger?
Sep 21 14:15:00 <davidmichaelkarr>	Newyorkadam: Well, I would guess that would refer to the fact that in a multi-threaded application, you could potentially be at multiple breakpoints at the same time, so you could inspect the stack at each breakpoint separately.
Sep 21 14:15:14 <Newyorkadam>	davidmichaelkarr: how would you do that?
Sep 21 14:15:50 <davidmichaelkarr>	Newyorkadam: You just click on the stack entry in the debugger frame.  You'd have to scroll up or down to find the thread that has hit a breakpoint.

Sep 21 15:22:12 <davidmichaelkarr>	soman: Best to use regexp for that.

Sep 23 14:42:54 <davidmichaelkarr>	panzon: It's generally going to be pretty hard to debug code if you don't have the source code.  However, you might be able to get some mileage out of installing "jd-eclipse", a decompiler plugin for Eclipse.  You'll have to be able to set breakpoints in the decompiled code, assuming the code hasn't been "broken" by an obfuscation system.

Sep 28 11:22:53 <zain2>	I've added the JAVA_HOME variable
Sep 28 11:24:49 <zain2_>	it worked! Thank you for your help :D
Sep 28 11:26:09 <mvvvv>	zain2_, what will you do with eclipse

Sep 28 11:26:29 <zain2_>	code java
Sep 28 11:26:50 <mvvvv>	so you'll have to install the JDK ^_^

Sep 28 11:27:46 <mvvvv>	ok so enjoy
Sep 28 11:28:09 <zain2_>	thanks :) Still waiting for installation to finish and for it to launch without errors, so fingers crossed
Sep 28 11:28:38 <mvvvv>	you don't need JAVA_HOME if you have JDK_HOME (so your jre is useless)
Sep 28 11:32:07 <zain2_>	Everything works now, so I'm afraid to change anything :p
Sep 28 11:32:09 <zain2_>	it's fine, right?
Sep 28 11:32:45 <mvvvv>	you have to keep in mind you have a JRE and a JDK installed (so 2 JRE)
Sep 28 11:42:55 <zain2_>	oh
Sep 28 11:43:06 <zain2_>	so I remove the JDE JAVA_HOME (or whatever it was) thing?
Sep 28 11:44:00 <mvvvv>	and replace with JDK_HOME
Sep 28 11:44:51 <Mooniac>	when exporting to a runnable jar, what's the difference between "exporting required libraries into ..." vs. "package required libraries into ..."
Sep 28 11:45:31 <zain2_>	I added the JDK path to the "Path" name, though
Sep 28 11:45:35 <zain2_>	I was following a guide
Sep 28 11:46:35 <mvvvv>	zain2_, I check that and I think you should keep JAVA_HOME and update it to the jdk directory
Sep 28 11:47:20 <zain2_>	so instead of JAVA_HOME going to jde it should go to jdk?
Sep 28 11:47:31 <mvvvv>	eclipse know JDK_HOME but no all the other java programs
Sep 28 11:47:43 <mvvvv>	yes
Sep 28 11:48:15 <zain2_>	ok I'll do that, thanks! :)

Sep 28 14:23:18 <metrixx>	there is a local wsdl file and also i have web service url. wsdl is hidden on service server. how can i consume this service on java via eclipse?
Sep 28 14:35:43 <frostilicus>	I've been trying to use the java search to find methods that return List<MyClass>, but no matter what I do I get results for methods that return any type of List
Sep 28 14:36:13 <frostilicus>	I've also tried the type search and limiting the locations to method return types, but I get the same problem.
Sep 28 14:36:37 <frostilicus>	It seems like all type arguments for parameterized types are ignored.

Sep 28 17:05:13 <nitind>	frostilicus: Are you doing this through the UI or from the API? If you posted http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39754974/how-to-search-for-methods-that-return-a-list-of-a-specific-class-in-eclipse , it's a little hard to tell.
Sep 28 17:05:29 <frostilicus>	through the UI
Sep 28 19:14:24 <hanshenrik_>	... for some reason, eclipse, when i press ctrl+F11 , compiles it, runs it, disregards stderr AND stdout, and just shows me what number main() returned...
Sep 28 19:14:37 <hanshenrik_>	how do i make eclipse NOT hide stdout/stderr from "console" ?
Sep 28 19:15:54 <hanshenrik_>	nvm, i think i found it ("global build console" or somthin)
Sep 28 20:10:53 <carabia>	(Eclipse CDT) Why is it that whenever I open project properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings, eclipse freezes for a minute?
Sep 28 20:10:58 <carabia>	not even exaggerating
Sep 28 20:12:42 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: platform?
Sep 28 20:24:18 <carabia>	linux
Sep 28 20:25:19 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: be more specific. Ubuntu?
Sep 28 20:28:55 <carabia>	yeah this one's based on 16.04
Sep 28 20:30:17 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: may not matter, but you should turn off gtk3 in eclipse.
Sep 28 20:31:39 <carabia>	is it a switch or disabled within eclipse?
Sep 28 20:32:13 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=turn+off+gtk3+in+eclipse
Sep 28 20:33:17 <carabia>	yeah thanks, would have taken you less time actually to spit it out than to be a smartass
Sep 28 20:35:38 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: it's simply an easy way to ensure we're talking about the same search results.
Sep 28 20:36:57 <carabia>	:D sure ha, well thanks I'll give it a shot anyway.
Sep 28 22:20:57 <carabia>	davidmichaelkarr: and I finally got the time to try it out. It actually works, thank you sir!
Sep 29 00:17:43 <nitind>	Which version of Eclipse is it? You might be better off leaving it on with the newest.
Sep 29 00:35:29 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: might be worth testing it again with your change reverted.
Sep 29 00:35:51 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: are you aware of specific gtk3 fixes?
Sep 29 00:48:04 <carabia>	nitind: this is 4.5.12
Sep 29 00:48:09 <carabia>	4.5.2*
Sep 29 00:48:35 <carabia>	davidmichaelkarr: yeah, I did. And it's just dead slow when gtk3 is enabled
Sep 29 00:52:40 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: ok. When you upgrade to latest (4.6.1 just today), might test toggling it again. I'm not aware of gtk3 fixes, but i'm not tracking that.

Sep 29 05:58:22 <sigdk>	Hello. I go to Preferences --> Java --> Code Style --> Formatter and I un-tick the "Empty lines" option (the last one)
Sep 29 05:59:05 <sigdk>	If I understood correctly, in this way, eclipse *will not* indent my empty lines (there will be no tabs/spaces/etc there)
Sep 29 05:59:32 <sigdk>	Yet this doesn't seem to work. Is there maybe some "conflict"? Am I doing something wrong?
Sep 29 06:28:31 <mistria>	sigdk: if you untick, those lines don't get formatted
Sep 29 06:28:42 <mistria>	sigdk: that doesn't skip auto-indentation I believe
Sep 29 06:29:40 <mistria>	sigdk: there's a setting somewhere called "remove trailing whitespaces". I believe it is what you want
Sep 29 06:30:17 <sigdk>	mistria, hmm... I'll check that, thanks
Sep 29 09:48:23 <chibby0ne>	Hey guys is anyone familiar with code coverage using cobertura?
Sep 29 09:50:41 <Zemeio>	Hi guys. I am trying to use eclipse neon and point it to a different jdk using -vm argument, and it's not working. Do you know if it is a known issue? (yes it is above -vmargs)
Sep 29 09:52:01 <Zemeio>	When I try to open the clipse it gives me an error, looking at the path pointed on my system variable, I am on windows 7.
Sep 29 09:52:27 <mvvvv>	Zemeio, do you have JAVA_HOME or JDK_HOME variable ?
Sep 29 09:55:14 <mistria>	chibby0ne: cobertura is highly deprecated, jacoco is the replacement
Sep 29 09:57:30 <chibby0ne>	mistria, I noticed that jacoco is has more active releases than cobertura... but is it really that deprecated?
Sep 29 10:01:09 <Zemeio>	mvvvv: both
Sep 29 10:01:34 <mvvvv>	does it work when your remove -vm arg ?
Sep 29 10:02:32 <Zemeio>	It gives me the same error, I don't think it is using the version specified in the vm.
Sep 29 10:04:02 <mvvvv>	what is the -vm arg ?
Sep 29 10:04:41 <Zemeio>	C:/Java8/jre/bin/server/jvm.dll
Sep 29 10:05:03 <mvvvv>	Zemeio, https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini
Sep 29 10:05:06 <Zemeio>	I tried with C:/Java8/bin/javaw.exe too
Sep 29 10:05:27 <mvvvv>	does this file exist ? the path is strange
Sep 29 10:05:34 <mvvvv>	how did you installed java ?
Sep 29 10:05:53 <Zemeio>	It is portable, the file exists and actually works
Sep 29 10:06:48 <mvvvv>	are you sure this is a windows version of java ?
Sep 29 10:07:25 <Zemeio>	Yeah, I downloaded the 32 bits exe and, extracted and ran the tools (before running the files didn't work at all)
Sep 29 10:09:07 <mvvvv>	https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html
Sep 29 10:18:18 <Zemeio>	I can't change my main java, I have to use a different one on eclipse
Sep 29 10:21:59 <mvvvv>	you have to check your java installation
Sep 29 10:49:27 <Zemeio>	K, it's working now. I don't know what it was, just copied my friend's eclipse.ini and adapted the file path to mine
Sep 29 10:49:34 <Zemeio>	Thanks for the help mvvvv
Sep 29 11:30:32 <hydrian>	Ello all
Sep 29 11:30:44 <hydrian>	I've got a plugin issue that's driving my nuts.
Sep 29 11:32:06 <hydrian>	I'm trying to remove plugin. I've removed it from the plugin directory. I've removed the configuration files from the workspace.
Sep 29 11:32:17 <hydrian>	But it still shows up as being installed.
Sep 29 11:36:04 <hydrian>	I'm tring to uninstall the plugin because I need to install an older version
Sep 29 11:36:40 <hydrian>	subclipse is the culprit.
Sep 29 11:39:53 <hydrian>	If anyone answered me, I'm missed it. (Unexpected disconnect)
Sep 29 15:34:41 <davidmichaelkarr>	One thing that I've never been able to figure out in "Search" is how to find all references to any classes in a particular package, and in all its child packages.
Sep 29 15:37:29 <davidmichaelkarr>	Hmm, never mind.  I guess i was simpler than I thought.  Search for "packagepath.*" and Types and All References.
Sep 29 15:43:51 <neilthereildeil>	can someone please help my build a large java project in eclipse?
Sep 29 15:47:01 <neilthereildeil>	i have a bunch of folder with the code organized by the package nameing convention
Sep 29 15:47:10 <neilthereildeil>	how can i import them into a buildable eclipse project?
Sep 29 15:51:21 <nitind>	copy/paste from a Finder/Explorer window? import from FileSystem?
Sep 29 15:54:02 <davidmichaelkarr>	One thing that I use a lot is hovering on a type reference to get the description of the type.  However, sometimes other "hovers" take precedence over the javadoc info, like checkstyle.  Is there a key I can press, or some action, that will let me see the javadoc info, overriding the hover precedence?
Sep 29 15:56:59 <nitind>	davidmichaelkarr: F2
Sep 29 15:57:30 <nitind>	You can also set modifiers on the Hovers preference page.
Sep 29 15:58:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: Well, no, that's not it, but I did just figure it out. That only gives the tooltip window keyboard focus. I found the hovers prefs page which shows the modifiers.  I thought it was something like that, but I didn't know which ones did what.  I found what modifier javadoc is set to, and I see that that works.
Sep 29 15:59:01 <davidmichaelkarr>	Amazing how asking questions here makes me figure it out 5 seconds later. :)
Sep 29 16:04:27 <nitind>	And what you can learn by trying to figure out how to answer the questions you don't already know how to answer.
Sep 29 16:15:02 <Infested1>	hello, i need to do a project in prolog, and i would like to do the gui in java. does eclipse support prolog in java or anything of the sort?
Sep 29 16:18:29 <davidmichaelkarr>	Infested1: you might just build a plain java gui and execute your prolog interpreter from it.
Sep 29 16:19:58 <Infested1>	well its a game, all the rules and checking moves are valid and stuff like that should happen in prolog. the gui part is just for ease of use and game management (like whos turn it is and calling the right methods)
Sep 29 16:24:39 <Infested1>	davidmichaelkarr: forgot to notify
Sep 29 16:26:29 <davidmichaelkarr>	Infested1: doesn't change my answer.
Sep 29 16:27:18 <Maxel>	not sure if this is an eclipse question: I have eclipse with weblogic server. I am trying to set up weblogic and when I add my username/password credentials and hit test, it says successful, but then as soon as I hit ok, the message next to the server says user authentication failed
Sep 29 16:28:59 <Infested1>	ok then i dont understand your answer. how do i execute my prolog interpreter from it, and get an answer back (and maybe send it info), and how do i keep the prolog's knowledge of the game alive?
Sep 29 17:28:48 <nitind>	Maxel: What does "set up weblogic" mean, and is that related to Eclipse somehow?
Sep 29 17:32:25 <davidmichaelkarr>	Infested1: you can run other executables from java. You can pass it input and read output.
Sep 30 07:37:59 <chibby0ne>	Hey guys is anyone familiar with code coverage using Jacoco? My problem is that the report lists the class analyzed as test class and not the Class under Test.
Sep 30 07:42:41 <chibby0ne>	is there any eclipse project that uses jacoco?
Sep 30 07:47:24 <mvvvv>	chibby0ne, computer says yes !
Sep 30 07:52:11 <chibby0ne>	oh forgot to mention: this is related to using Jacoco in maven builds. Not the Eclipse Plugin Eclmma
Sep 30 07:53:01 <mvvvv>	computer says yes
Sep 30 07:55:05 <chibby0ne>	mvvvv, ?
Sep 30 07:55:44 <mvvvv>	google : eclipse maven jacoco  --> http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html
Sep 30 08:06:17 <chibby0ne>	mvvvv, funny. I did that... it doesn't explain how to use jacoco to create coverage reports of eclipse-plugin from eclipse-test-plugin does it?
Sep 30 08:09:03 <mvvvv>	not funny I didn't understood your question. so you want to test your eclipse-plugin using jacoco
Sep 30 08:11:04 <chibby0ne>	mvvvv, computer says yes !
Sep 30 08:12:55 <chibby0ne>	mvvvv, just in case: yes that's what I meant: produce test coverage of an eclipse-plugin
Sep 30 08:18:49 <mvvvv>	So you can do that from eclipse launch configurations : http://www.eclemma.org/userdoc/launching.html and you want to do that from maven
Sep 30 08:22:23 <chibby0ne>	mvvvv, yeah exactly
Sep 30 08:24:34 <mvvvv>	something like that : https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/977961/
Sep 30 08:32:40 <chibby0ne>	mvvvv, not really. I'm not using RCPTT. I'm doing unit tests at the moment, but I also have SWTBot tests that I would like to add to the coverage report.
Sep 30 08:34:20 <mistria>	chibby0ne: Eclipse Platform and SWTBot do have code coverage produced by Jacoco and reported to Sonar
Sep 30 08:35:22 <mvvvv>	mistria, with RCPTT ...
Sep 30 08:35:25 <mistria>	chibby0ne: just noticed that SWTBot seems to have the same problem as you have
Sep 30 08:35:36 <mistria>	mvvvv: no
Sep 30 08:37:00 <mistria>	chibby0ne: see https://dev.eclipse.org/sonar/drilldown/measures/33441?metric=coverage for example
Sep 30 08:37:46 <mistria>	chibby0ne: however, Sonar does all the magic, all we did is provide it a nice jacoco.exec to report
Sep 30 08:40:30 <mistria>	chibby0ne: and here is the job configuration: https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.resources-SonarQube/
Sep 30 08:46:45 <chibby0ne>	mistria, ok this is definitively helpful! Thanks mistria!!
Sep 30 08:47:17 <chibby0ne>	mistria, what I did notice is that they're not using jacoco report goal... they just use "prepare-agent"
Sep 30 08:47:41 <mistria>	chibby0ne: yes, Sonar does the report
Sep 30 08:48:16 <mistria>	chibby0ne: it's easier to install Sonar  and let it work than to try to automate report creation via Maven
Sep 30 08:48:32 <mistria>	chibby0ne: moreover, it looks nicer and is easier to browse
Sep 30 08:49:13 <mistria>	chibby0ne: if you interest in code coverage and other quality indicators, using SonarQube is worth it
Sep 30 08:49:22 <mistria>	chibby0ne: especially since it's free ;)
Sep 30 08:49:58 <chibby0ne>	mistria, it does look much prettier, but I was hoping at some point to show the code coverage stats from jenkins itself (using the jacoco jenkins plugin)
Sep 30 08:50:26 <mistria>	chibby0ne: ok, I never tried it
Sep 30 08:51:33 <chibby0ne>	mistria, just checked; there's also a sonarcube jenkins plugin...
Sep 30 08:54:36 <mistria>	chibby0ne: yes, Platform uses it. Hudson/Jenkins runs build (which generate the jacoco.exec) and then invoke the SonarQube plugin (which triggers analysis and report)
Sep 30 08:54:54 <mistria>	chibby0ne: it's a post-build step like JUnit reports
Sep 30 08:57:37 <mizhka>	hi! it will be nice to see new OS support (*bsd), but what should be done for it? actually port of Eclipse exists for a long time, actual version is 4.6.0. there is also bugzilla ticket...
Sep 30 09:02:26 <chibby0ne>	mistria, I see! interesting approach indeed!
Sep 30 09:22:17 <chibby0ne>	mistria, checking the poms from the build.. I don't see any configuration of jacoco plugin
Sep 30 09:24:24 <mistria>	chibby0ne: it's http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator.git/tree/eclipse-platform-parent/pom.xml#n1013 . The jacoco.destFile property is set to an absolutePath in the hudson job and passed to the SonarQube Hudson plugoin
Sep 30 09:26:21 <chibby0ne>	mistria, oh ok I just went and cloned eclipse.platform.resources because that's what the build showed, but yeah this is the parent of all the platform subprojects right?
Sep 30 09:55:08 <chibby0ne>	mistria, mmm I just noticed I still have the same problem of having the stats for the test itself and not the plugin...
Sep 30 10:55:04 <Gamoder_>	Hi everyone, how can I ensure some classes are available in the runtime for some plugin project? I always get some NoClassDefFoundError for classes which I think should be on the classpath
Sep 30 16:11:48 <dmiles>	Import Software From an Existing Isntallation is very very awesome
Sep 30 16:12:06 <dmiles>	i wonder how long that has been there?
