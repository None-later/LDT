Jul 26 05:47:29 <CustosL1men>	O
Jul 26 05:58:02 <mistria>	CustosL1men: do you know how to build this project without Eclipse?
Jul 26 06:11:05 <CustosL1men>	mistria, I guess I can hack something out with javac
Jul 26 06:12:34 <CustosL1men>	let me get a file tree
Jul 26 06:12:43 <mistria>	CustosL1men: Eclipse builds automatically, All you have to do is to set the right classpath
Jul 26 06:13:14 <CustosL1men>	mistria, where is the output of build ?
Jul 26 06:13:35 <mistria>	CustosL1men: classes are usually in the bin/ folder
Jul 26 06:14:20 <mistria>	CustosL1men: if you want the jar, you have to use File > Export > Jar File
Jul 26 06:15:25 <CustosL1men>	http://termbin.com/n2zc
Jul 26 06:19:42 <mistria>	CustosL1men: ok, and what are you trying to achieve exactly?
Jul 26 06:19:57 <CustosL1men>	mistria, I want to build jar
Jul 26 06:20:02 <CustosL1men>	mistria, but what you suggested did wokr
Jul 26 06:20:04 <CustosL1men>	mistria, but what you suggested did work
Jul 26 06:20:11 <CustosL1men>	export jar
Jul 26 06:49:32 <samuel_m>	mistria: thanks for the hint about reporting a bug yesterday, just did that: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=498487
Jul 26 08:39:25 <BadApe>	what is eclipse neon? is it just a new naming scheme?
Jul 26 08:47:37 <CustosL1men>	BadApe, neon is the version/release name
Jul 26 08:50:19 <BadApe>	no more releases like pluto, i guess maybe they ran out of names
Jul 26 09:28:27 <raddy>	Hello Everybody
Jul 26 09:28:41 <raddy>	This is not directly related to eclipse
Jul 26 09:29:02 <raddy>	But people who have experience in Java can try to help

Jul 26 11:45:43 <CustosL1men>	can I do non graphical install for eclipse ?
Jul 26 11:47:27 <mistria>	CustosL1men: Depends on what you want to do, Eclipse can be extended to load without UI, but it's not part of the default packages
Jul 26 11:48:01 <CustosL1men>	actually - I want to build eclipse stuff from command line
Jul 26 11:48:06 <strykerawb>	mistria,  PM
Jul 26 11:48:13 <CustosL1men>	so I downloaded eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz (neon version)
Jul 26 11:48:35 <CustosL1men>	but when I run ./eclipse-installer/eclipse-inst I get graphical installer
Jul 26 11:48:40 <CustosL1men>	I want non graphical installer
Jul 26 11:48:48 <CustosL1men>	or if I can have non installer based eclipse it will also be fine
Jul 26 11:50:24 <mistria>	CustosL1men: ok, those are packages. From http://eclipse.org/downloads, there's a small link behind the installer
Jul 26 11:50:35 <CustosL1men>	ok thanks
Jul 26 11:50:40 <mistria>	CustosL1men: you can directly download zip/tars
Jul 26 11:50:41 <CustosL1men>	let me give it a go
Jul 26 11:51:17 <mistria>	CustosL1men: if you're on a recent and developer friendly Linux distro such as Fedora, there a native packages available with dnf
Jul 26 11:51:21 <mistria>	or apt
Jul 26 11:51:26 <CustosL1men>	mistria, on gentoo
Jul 26 11:51:34 <CustosL1men>	mistria, there are native packages but I dont like them
Jul 26 11:51:49 <mistria>	CustosL1men: don't think there's something recent on Gentoo
Jul 26 12:12:57 <CustosL1men>	so this builds classes hnb eclipse-neon eclipse -nosplash -data "${HOME}/eclipse-workspace/" -application org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core.aptBuild
Jul 26 12:13:04 <CustosL1men>	but not sure how to get it to build jar
Jul 26 12:18:22 <mistria>	CustosL1men: you can try the antBuilder application, and pass an Ant build.xml file
Jul 26 12:20:35 <CustosL1men>	cant I somehow get maven to build eclipse projects ?
Jul 26 12:26:38 <mistria>	CustosL1men: what do you ,mean bu Eclipse projects? Eclipse plugins? or regular Java projects?
Jul 26 12:28:00 <CustosL1men>	mistria, regular java projects like this: http://termbin.com/wbut
Jul 26 12:29:28 <mistria>	CustosL1men: ok, so yes, they can be built with Maven. But this task is independent from the IDE. The IDE can help and will understand Maven, but once your project is Maven based, you simply build it with Maven, no need for the IDE to build.
Jul 26 12:30:15 <CustosL1men>	mistria, see - I just want a simple straight forward way to generate jars for like 20 projects like this from command line
Jul 26 12:30:37 <CustosL1men>	normally I use maven as base - but people who made these projects did not
Jul 26 12:30:53 <CustosL1men>	and I'm trying to figure out how to get this to build automatically for me to jars
Jul 26 12:33:18 <mistria>	CustosL1men: the best way is to migrate this project to Maven. You can automate Eclipse export with Ant, but it's a PITA to maintain such approach
Jul 26 12:34:58 <CustosL1men>	ok - let me see about adding pom.xml files
Jul 26 12:35:29 <CustosL1men>	thanks for help mistria - really means allot ;)
Jul 26 12:35:45 <CustosL1men>	I normally just use vim + maven
Jul 26 12:35:58 <CustosL1men>	so I'm a bit overwhelmed by this IDE stuff
Jul 26 12:46:27 <mistria>	CustosL1men: there's for sure a learning curve, but it's wrth iy
Jul 26 12:46:36 <mistria>	worth it
Jul 26 12:46:58 <dan>	Hi, I just wanted to know, howcome Eclipse does not support JavaFX by default? Is JavaFX considered "dead"?
Jul 26 12:47:00 <CustosL1men>	mistria, for me not really - vim > - but anyway - main challenge is to just get this stuff auto building from command line
Jul 26 12:49:23 <mistria>	CustosL1men: vim is for sure an awesome editor. But automated build, awesome completion, debug, instant error reporting... Even if typimg cam be slower, all the other tools make coding good things easier
Jul 26 12:49:49 <CustosL1men>	mistria, but IMO automated build just inside maven is not usefull
Jul 26 12:50:06 <CustosL1men>	instant error reporting is nice, and auto completion is nice - but not that nice that I ever miss it
Jul 26 12:50:18 <CustosL1men>	<CustosL1men> mistria, but IMO automated build just inside maven is not usefull < I mean just inside eclipse
Jul 26 12:50:39 <CustosL1men>	like I said normally I juse maven - and then for people who want to use eclipse its no problem - but other way round is serious issue IMO
Jul 26 12:50:57 <CustosL1men>	if I cant build something easily from command line its a failure
Jul 26 12:52:29 <mistria>	CustomL1men: I agree about build shouldn't require IDE
Jul 26 12:53:06 <mistria>	CustomL1men: however, the last versions of Maven support in Eclipse IDE sometimes have pretty good completion. Infering parameters and documentation.
Jul 26 13:48:06 <BadApe_>	hello, i see neon has gulp support
Jul 26 13:48:22 <BadApe_>	do i need to install something?
Jul 26 15:03:04 <cjoseph>	hi, I'm using eclipse mars on an HTML page and I see a little warning triangle in the editor next to an iframe tag...but there are no error/problems listed in the problem window
Jul 26 15:03:20 <cjoseph>	any ideas why this is happening?
Jul 26 15:46:08 <nitind>	cjoseph: Have you not yet saved it to disk and let the project build (assuming the validation builder is set on that project)?
Jul 26 15:47:09 <cjoseph>	@nitind: is saved to disk...I have never run build, as it's just static HTML
Jul 26 16:03:47 <nitind>	cjoseph: You can righ-click on the file and Validate from there...I think.
Jul 26 16:04:04 <nitind>	Otherwise it's not going to add anything to the Problems View.
Jul 26 16:08:54 <cjoseph>	oh, that did it
Jul 26 16:08:57 <cjoseph>	thanks

Jul 27 16:13:07 <Vauff>	hi, i'm having an issue with eclipse where the code detail hover window is black and cannot be read, this started happening on a new neon install on linux with an imported workspace from windows mars https://i.imgur.com/bcwHwWS.png
Jul 27 16:15:27 <jeen>	Vauff, that's a known problem with Eclipse on Linux, I've seen it happen as far back as Helios. Fix is to install gnome-color-chooser and there configure background/foreground colors for tooltips.
Jul 27 16:16:03 <jeen>	see http://askubuntu.com/questions/45001/how-to-fix-black-tooltips-in-eclipse
Jul 27 16:18:03 <Vauff>	do you know if that would work with cinnamon?
Jul 27 17:26:37 <Vauff>	jeen: i've got it up and running now, however it seems that eclipse doesn't listen to anything i do with the background colour, the foreground does change properly though
Jul 27 18:39:35 <chealer>	hi. When debugging, when a variable is selected in the Variables view and its value changes, it does not highlight in yellow (since it's highlighted as selected). is this a known issue?
Jul 27 22:38:15 <_44trent>	so i have some code, but it's all commented out by line...how do I uncomment them all
Jul 27 22:38:36 <_44trent>	i'm trying to use find and replace to get rid of it, btw
Jul 27 22:39:57 <_44trent>	i got rid of the comments that didn't have the line number in them but for example on line 233...it's like this at the start "/* 233 */"
Jul 27 22:40:11 <_44trent>	is there a way i could make it remove everything starting with /* and ending with /*?
Jul 27 22:45:17 <_44trent>	uhm, is anyone here?
Jul 27 22:49:07 <_44trent>	*tumbleweed*
Jul 27 22:55:33 <_44trent>	just highlighting the lines and doing control + shift + \ keeps the whitespaces and the numbers
Jul 27 22:56:23 <phroa>	the comments start and end on the same line, always?
Jul 27 23:04:19 <_44trent>	yeah
Jul 27 23:04:46 <phroa>	they are the only thing on a given line?
Jul 27 23:04:59 <_44trent>	well each line has the comment, and then the code

Jul 27 23:06:49 <phroa>	have you thought about telling jd-gui to not generate those
Jul 27 23:06:59 <_44trent>	uhm, no.
Jul 27 23:07:05 <_44trent>	that's a thing?
Jul 27 23:07:23 <phroa>	that's such an intrusive feature I have to assume you can turn it off
Jul 27 23:08:06 <_44trent>	yeah someone else had already messed with a little, they have a server that is still running alpha and he had to make a new authentication server...
Jul 27 23:08:19 <_44trent>	and they disabled the part that makes it download the game
Jul 27 23:11:05 <_44trent>	i mean, I could get the uncommented code from the unmodified launcher actually
Jul 27 23:11:09 *	_44trent facepalms
Jul 27 23:12:51 <_44trent>	yep the code is untouched except for those things, I did a diff check first
Jul 27 23:13:01 <_44trent>	should be able to just copy it back in
Jul 27 23:19:30 <_44trent>	weird, those comment things are happening with everything...
Jul 27 23:19:36 <_44trent>	is eclipse doing something?
Jul 28 00:46:33 <khlorghaal>	cdt doesnt appear to be passing any of my -l args http://hastebin.com/zawelinijo.tex i know the project settings are correct, but its not showing -lSDL2 anywhere in the output
Jul 28 00:49:56 <khlorghaal>	even if i manually put it in linker misc args it doesnt show up
Jul 28 05:50:09 <StephenS>	hey is it possible to have Insert Dependency in pom.xml when I do alt+space?
Jul 28 07:31:44 <rann>	Hi all, running Eclipse Neon since three days. Have an annoying bug that appears when trying to alter workingsets in Enterprise Explorer and/or Project Explorer. I get an error dialog that tells me that a certain icon in an obj16/ directory could not be found.
Jul 28 07:32:59 <rann>	This seems innocent enough, but two times already, after this error and after closing the IDE, Enterprise Explorer crashed due to workingsets.xml being in an invalid state (two workingsets with the same name it says and creates a modern art of ui elements in Enterprise Explorer)
Jul 28 08:03:34 <pandaadb>	Hi - I have set up a gradle project for scala. It builds fine and i can import it into eclipse, however every time I change anything the editor tells me evertthing is broken
Jul 28 08:56:36 <chealer>	my issue is already tracked in ticket #246733.
Jul 28 08:58:42 <chealer>	if someone has the necessary privilege, this should not be assigned to CDT.
Jul 28 11:52:21 <nitind>	rann: You should report which icon cant be found through ~bugzilla
Jul 28 11:52:21 <Arbalest>	Bugzilla is the bug tracking system used by Eclipse. Open new bug reports and/or enhancement requests https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi / Search for existing bugs and/or enhancement requests https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/query.cgi
Jul 28 11:56:12 <rann>	nitind: alrighty, will do
Jul 28 11:58:34 <rann>	nitind: This one is getting the same backtrace (new, unconfirmed: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=488618)
Jul 28 11:59:38 <rann>	And this one: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=465456
Jul 28 12:03:11 <rann>	heh, how appropriate: "This is a timebomb that shouldn't be left ticking without a target milestone."
Jul 28 15:33:41 <_44trent>	so i'm trying to modify an older minecraft launcher but I can't seem to start it with any run configuration
Jul 28 15:34:12 <_44trent>	iirc the main class is LauncherFrame...in net.minecraft.LauncherFrame...
Jul 28 15:34:20 <_44trent>	but it still won't start
Jul 28 15:35:47 <_44trent>	does anyone know how the heck I can launch it?
Jul 28 15:36:01 <nitind>	WHat have you already tried?
Jul 28 15:36:32 <_44trent>	well, I opened the run configurations and made a run configuration with it's main method being "net.minecraft.LauncherFrame"
Jul 28 15:36:34 <_44trent>	but it can't find that
Jul 28 15:36:55 <_44trent>	i try to do it from the parent directory as the launcher also needs LZMA stuff...
Jul 28 15:37:40 <_44trent>	manifest.mf in meta-inf does say the main class is "net.minecraft.LauncherFrame"
Jul 28 15:38:08 <_44trent>	http://hastebin.com/poyunarero.pas
Jul 28 15:38:12 <_44trent>	that's the manifest
Jul 28 15:38:30 <_44trent>	i don't see why it won't run at all, it doesn't find any methods at all, only the system ones
Jul 28 15:39:32 <_44trent>	do i need to set launcherframe.java as my main class or something?
Jul 28 15:40:03 <_44trent>	this is the directory structure of my project btw: https://vgy.me/s2WMTH
Jul 28 15:43:06 <_44trent>	i should have set that as my source folder probably

Jul 29 03:36:04 <Stummi>	Is there some way to hide warnings from generated source files?
Jul 29 05:41:15 <rann>	Stummi: Apparently this is a feature in the JDT plugin (so .java only) since 3.8: Project properties > Java Build Path > Compiler > Source, "Selectively ignore errors/warnings from source folders". The toggle is called "Ignore optional compile problems" and can be enabled on per-folder basis

Jul 30 12:10:26 <red-lichtie>	Hi, I've just installed the latest version of eclipse (neon) using the online installer. Now when I try to add another site I am getting the following error "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class sun.security.ssl.SSLSessionImpl"
Jul 30 12:11:48 <red-lichtie>	But the error is coming from within that class. Any ideas?
Jul 30 12:17:10 <red-lichtie>	I looks like it might be a nJVM problem
Jul 30 12:47:39 <red-lichtie>	I get the error using openjdk 8 but not with oracle, so using the "-vm" to force that one
Jul 30 17:02:58 <TheChubu>	hi! i have a question
Jul 30 17:03:12 <TheChubu>	does anybody knows where on earth i can get Eclipse launcher's icons?
Jul 30 17:03:35 <TheChubu>	afaik they do like some icons with a tiny "JEE" or "PHP" or whatever for each of the distributions
Jul 30 17:03:42 <TheChubu>	dunno where to find htem
Jul 30 22:27:01 <ecfuser71476>	Hello!
Jul 31 06:05:16 <eagles0513875_>	hey guys anyone here
Jul 31 06:07:03 <eagles0513875_>	i need some major help with exporting to a runnable jar file but for some reason im running it on the command line for testing purposes
Jul 31 06:07:18 <eagles0513875_>	and its like the jar file is not finding the java file with the class that has the main method
Jul 31 06:07:28 <eagles0513875_>	i check with java tvc on the jar file and i see the app.java file there
Jul 31 06:07:30 <eagles0513875_>	any ideas
Jul 31 06:07:56 <eagles0513875_>	running the main class from with in eclipse works fine no problem just jar file
Jul 31 09:00:56 <surial>	eagles0513875_: what exactly are you running? java -cp myjar.jar or java -jar myjar.jar? Also, separately, you should really be making these with maven, gradle, or ant, not eclipse.
Jul 31 10:11:30 <eagles0513875_>	surial: they are ant scripts im using eclipse and telling it to export everything to a runnable jar file
Jul 31 10:12:01 <eagles0513875_>	surial: thing is this was a single developer FOSS project and lead dev is stepping back. and im taking over so i am with out documentation on how things are if you like i can provide you a link to the repository.
Jul 31 10:15:38 <eagles0513875_>	surial: another issue is that this is 25 seperate projects and instead of creating an installer for each I want something which is a bit more portable
Jul 31 10:15:49 <eagles0513875_>	hence my wanting to use a runnable jar
Jul 31 11:07:16 <surial>	eagles0513875_: you should make this monolithic runnable jar with maven, gradle, or ant, and not eclipse.
Jul 31 11:07:31 <eagles0513875_>	how does one do that with ant
Jul 31 11:07:49 <eagles0513875_>	if ant scripts are spread across 25 different projects in eclipse
Jul 31 14:23:45 <Tase>	Installed jdk 1.8 x86, run eclisep-insta-win32.exe, does nothing
Jul 31 14:24:06 <Tase>	run eclipse-inst-win64.exe, shows missing 64bit jfk (as expected)
Jul 31 14:24:35 <Tase>	i went to the wiki for install instructions, but it forwards to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php?show_instructions=TRUE
Jul 31 14:24:39 <Tase>	which shows nothing
Jul 31 17:14:37 <flappynerd>	for the CDT (C++ Developer Tools) do I need the "C++ Developer Tools SDK" or is that only if I want to contribute to CDT itself?
Jul 31 19:42:56 <AlpTunga_>	Hello all
Jul 31 19:45:54 <AlpTunga_>	I had a problem about Eclipse Console doesn't get EOF (ctrl+d) as input and it was solved by updating it. It was eclipse-cpp-mars-R-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz. Something broke down and i was not able to launch it so i installed a new one from Ubuntu Software Center. Even though i updated it i still got the same problem.
Jul 31 20:05:59 <AlpTunga_>	Upgrading from previous Eclipse IDE package to Neon (4.6) is NOT supported https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_upgrade_Eclipse_IDE%3F
Jul 31 20:06:00 <AlpTunga_>	nvm.
Jul 31 20:09:56 <donald1>	I have just installed eclipse IDE with this tuto https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-java/installer-les-outils-de-developpement. I follow these instructions to setup a new project but at the selection of installed JRE after Window > Preferences I still do not see the bar situated under the name "package explorer". How to see this one to read my code on the right side and begin to code?
Jul 31 20:26:21 <davidmichaelkarr>	donald1: Sorry, but you'll have to be much more specific.  I have no idea what "do not see the bar" means. Also note that most people here will be english-speaking (and mostly not french-reading), so don't expect us to get much information from pages like that.
Jul 31 20:43:31 <donald1>	I have just installed eclipse IDE with this tuto https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-java/installer-les-outils-de-developpement. I follow these instructions to setup a new project but I can not create the left bar.
Jul 31 20:56:14 <upgrdman>	how do i attached a javadoc JAR for eclipse to see? im trying to use the Apache Commons Math library. i did the Add External JARs thing, and added the commons...jar and commons...javadoc.jar files. both are listed under Referenced Libraries. but Eclipse can't seem to see the javadoc when i hover over a method to try and see it's javadoc.
Aug 01 08:47:37 <carabia>	Question of Eclipse C/C++, when you write a function prototype, and later you define said function , is it possible for eclipse to auto-complete the parameters?
Aug 01 08:48:26 <carabia>	The way, e.g. visual studio does it, iirc
Aug 01 10:46:13 <RajRajRaj>	hi i am setting up eclipse cdt for existing code, that code required some environment variables to be set upfront in order to build it. how do i do it in eclipse build configuration.
Aug 01 14:46:38 <carabia>	I'll ask again, if anyone knows ~
Aug 01 14:46:43 <carabia>	Question of Eclipse C/C++, when you write a function prototype, and later you define said function , is it possible for eclipse to auto-complete the parameters?
Aug 01 15:41:01 <nitind>	So have you tried it, or having tried it, found it not to do that?
Aug 01 15:43:44 <themiddleman_>	Quick question, how can I access the project properties from a plugin
Aug 01 15:47:40 <nitind>	What do you mean?
Aug 01 15:48:55 <nitind>	themiddleman_: https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-core/documents/user_settings/faq.html#platformScopes and  http://help.eclipse.org/neon/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/ProjectScope.html ?
Aug 01 16:04:45 <davidmichaelkarr>	So I just tried to set up Tomcat 8.5.3 (in TomEE 7.0.1) in Eclipse, and apparently there is a long-standing required hack to the "ServerInfo.properties" file to fool Eclipse to knowing it's Tomcat 8.x. Seems strange this is still required.
Aug 01 16:09:05 <nitind>	Are you sure this doesn't fall under ~494936 ?
Aug 01 16:09:06 <Arbalest>	Bug 494936 - http://bugs.eclipse.org/494936 - WTP ServerTools / jst.server / 3.7 - All / All - NEW /  / normal / - Assignee: Larry.Isaacs - Add Tomcat 8.5 support to WTP Server Tools
Aug 01 16:11:35 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: Thanks.  Looks like that's it.  Not as long-standing as I thought.
Aug 01 16:12:30 <themiddleman_>	@nitind sry for the delay, I'm referring to project propeties, like when a project is right-clicked ->properties, is there a way I can get those same details through an eclipse plugin?
Aug 01 16:13:32 <nitind>	themiddleman_: So you don't mean accessing them, you mean opening the same dialog?
Aug 01 16:13:47 <themiddleman_>	yeah accessing them would be fine
Aug 01 16:15:18 <themiddleman_>	not really opening with a dialog
Aug 01 16:18:11 <nitind>	themiddleman_: Take a look at the two URLs I posted earlier (in the voice of Ida).
Aug 01 16:24:41 <davidmichaelkarr>	If I've created a Dynamic Web Project with the usual defaults, but I want to move step by step to a Maven organization, how do I properly move "WebContent" to "src/main/webapp"?
Aug 01 16:25:55 <themiddleman_>	@nitind so for example if a project also has git associated with it, when accessing the project properties I can see that it has git url associate with it, is there a way I can access that git URL?
Aug 01 16:29:50 <davidmichaelkarr>	Never mind.  Figured it out.
Aug 01 16:29:54 <nitind>	themiddleman_: I can only throw you at the jgit API, http://download.eclipse.org/jgit/site/4.4.1.201607150455-r/apidocs/index.html . The project isn't usually the git root itself.
Aug 01 16:32:24 <themiddleman_>	@nitind , ahhh ok
Aug 01 17:21:57 <themiddleman_>	hmmm, another dead end...
Aug 01 17:22:36 <themiddleman_>	is there a way to get the remote repository url of a project through a plugin?
Aug 01 17:25:21 <nitind>	Have you looked at how the GitProjectPropertyPage figures it out?
Aug 01 17:28:24 <themiddleman_>	@nitind , I have not, looking at it right now
Aug 01 18:27:36 <themiddleman_>	ok phew! Finally got it
Aug 01 19:45:52 <carabia>	nitind, I have not found a way to do it, if you asked me earlier.
Aug 01 19:46:34 <carabia>	I just figured, at least myself I found it kind of a crucial feature
Aug 01 19:47:02 <carabia>	Maybe not crucial, but a really really amazing quality of life -type of thing.
Aug 01 19:52:59 <themiddleman_>	so in order to get the git remote url for a project, I first get all the projects (IProject). 2. Iterating through all the projects I get the GITProvider through RepositoryProvider.getProvider. 3. get the repositoryMappings.entrySet, and iterate through the entrySet. 4.Get the repository from the RepositoryMapping, then follow http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2011/08/16/jgit-api-reading-configuration-information/

Aug 02 13:25:27 <davidmichaelkarr>	When running a REST service app in Tomcat in Eclipse, is there any way to prevent it from creating an editor view attempting to access the root url of the project?
Aug 02 13:37:39 <cores>	i have a really simple question, i want to open an existing c++ in place (it's in a source controlled directory), i don't want to "import" it. how can I do that?
Aug 02 13:38:05 <cores>	an existing c++ project in place, i mean
Aug 02 13:43:00 <cores>	i hope this "import existing projects into workspace" did the trick
Aug 02 13:43:50 <cores>	this "eclipse way" of doing things is confusing to a newcomer fresh off a vim,make,git workflow
Aug 02 13:44:36 <cores>	projects, workspaces, impoting, perspectives... what is going on..?

Aug 02 20:34:18 <donald1>	Ican create a new project but I can not edit it or open it on eclipse
Aug 02 21:40:44 <brandan>	what the directory where eclipse stores all it's settings in linux?
Aug 02 21:41:25 <brandan>	hmm
Aug 02 21:41:29 <brandan>	nvm
Aug 02 22:04:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: I figured it out.  It's a little weird, but even though Eclipse refers to the same Tomcat distro, it doesn't use the same server configs as the distro is using. I had to import the modified file into the server definition (which also strangely confused the server itself, because it wouldn't let me save the file until I stopped the server, but Eclipse
Aug 02 22:04:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	thought the server was already stopped. Restarting Eclipse fixed that.), then I could make additional changes to the imported files.
Aug 03 03:24:13 <Mazi>	Hi eclipse experts, can someone help with a question about Egit?
Aug 03 03:25:23 <Mazi>	At my local Git project I have edited some files and also added a new folder/library with ~500 files. How can I commit the new folder only? When using Team -> commit I get the list of all changed files but I want to commit the single folder + its files only.
Aug 03 03:25:24 <Arbalest>	Bug 500 does not exist.
Aug 03 03:39:11 <Stummi>	Mazi, git does not know anything about directories
Aug 03 03:39:21 <Stummi>	thats why you can't commit empty directories into a git repo
Aug 03 03:40:05 <Mazi>	Stummi, it is not empty. I just wonder if there is any easy way to commit a single directory only without other files which were also edited.
Aug 03 03:42:34 <Stummi>	ah, right, sorry. Misread your message
Aug 03 03:43:16 <Stummi>	not sure, I normally do stuff like this from the command line
Aug 03 04:09:16 <khlorghaal>	does CDT not support c++ 11? im getting erroneous errors and stackoverflow fixes arent working
Aug 03 04:09:40 <khlorghaal>	im using neon now, i was using indigo in the past and everything was fine
Aug 03 05:19:07 <khlorghaal>	started a new project and everything, bah ill just redownload indigo, its not like neon is a perceptible improvement
Aug 03 05:23:03 <khlorghaal>	there seems to be hundreds of people having issues like this and no fixes
Aug 03 07:15:11 <cores>	nitind: say you have a bunch of directories with make files and .cproject and .project files. how do i open them in eclipse so that i'm editing the files themselves, not just copies of the files?
Aug 03 07:15:23 <cores>	if that question even makes sense, obviously i'm a little confused
Aug 03 07:24:16 <jrtappers>	Is there a way to build an update site without launching a GUI instance of eclipse?
Aug 03 07:26:20 <jrtappers>	https://wiki.eclipse.org/PDE/User_Guide doesn't seem to have a section for update sites
Aug 03 09:06:41 <cores>	i feel like customizing eclipse is a full time job

Aug 03 12:52:12 <Jasaka>	If, while working, I remove a TODO or FIXME but it still displays as being there, how can I fix that? Or more generally: If eclipses error, warning or normal markers lag behind, how can I reload(?) them. Sorry if I'm not clear in my question as I'm not a native speaker.
Aug 03 12:58:46 <cores>	good question
Aug 03 12:58:50 <cores>	i have the same thing
Aug 03 13:03:05 <Jasaka>	Normally, it seems (with small projects) it reloads them on saving. But after a long time of work on a bigger project it just bugs out. I have a few classes which are now fully blue-underlined.
Aug 03 13:04:36 <psuzzi>	This seems a bug. Can you take a screenshot / anim gif, and report a new bug on Platform UI ?

Aug 03 16:28:14 <nitind>	cores: Once the git clone is in the Git Repositories View, use the context menu in the working directory tree to Import Projects from there. They will not be copied.
Aug 03 16:28:44 <nitind>	Jasaka: For what kind of file?
Aug 03 18:45:01 <Saul775>	Hello.  I'm creating a JAR file that uses Microsoft's JDBC driver.  However, everytime the method is invoked, I get a ClassNotFoundException.  I've had some help from people in #java and the Internet.  I'm instructed to set the classpath.  I thought I did this, but I still get the exception.  Where do I set the classpath in Eclipse?
Aug 03 18:45:21 <Saul775>	I've tried setting it under Window --> Preferences --> Java --> Build Path --> Classpath Variables.   Is this the correct location?
Aug 03 19:00:32 <nitind>	You would add the jar itself as a jar to the Java Build Path.
Aug 03 19:05:35 <Saul775>	Thank you, nitind.  I think I did this because I can see the JAR file under my referenced libraries.  Is this correct?
Aug 03 20:20:19 <nitind>	Saul775: yes. proably. haven't done JDBC in a while.

Aug 04 04:13:22 <waits_>	Is it possible to skip all the breakpoints until a certain method is executed in the call stack? I don't want to remove them.
Aug 04 04:27:30 <Amis>	Hello! I'm on Neon RC1 and I have a really hard time configuring C++11 support. I have a Makefile project with some custom (non-makefile) builder script and no matter what I do the eclipse indexer does not recognize the C++11 containers and elements. Some configuration settings: http://imgur.com/a/QECqv I've restarted several times and rebuild the index.
Aug 04 04:27:38 <Amis>	What am I doing wrong?
Aug 04 04:29:26 <Amis>	Is there some other magical settings hidden where I have to specify the flags?
Aug 04 04:30:12 <Amis>	Note that when I open a header that contains C++11 elements (like <memory>) then eclipse tells me that the __cplusplus define is not defined and excludes the code it guards
Aug 04 04:32:20 <Amis>	Correction: it says __cplusplus is defined as '199711L'
Aug 04 04:42:52 <Amis>	Thank god it solved itself because I was about the split my desk in half. It turns out that my freshly created Makefile project was not using the global provider settings so it did not have the "-std=c++11" flag added.
Aug 04 07:35:51 <Guest47968>	How can I make EGit ignore git repositories in subdirectories on pull? I just want to pull the top-level repository and not all git repositries in subdirectories.
Aug 04 12:05:37 <jmspeex>	Anyone knows how to prevent the "build on save" feature from triggering an infinite loop of builds on my project?
Aug 04 12:06:10 <jmspeex>	It started happening after I upgraded from Mars to Neon (upgrading Fedora 22 to Fedora 24)
Aug 04 12:45:43 <nitind>	That's really up to the builders.
Aug 04 12:46:20 <nitind>	wainersm: You can Disable the other breakpoints without fully Removing them. Check the Breakpoints View.

Aug 04 14:40:10 <ipun>	Arbalest thanks, will do
Aug 04 14:47:14 <ipun>	Considering this atricle is about 7 years old, I am wondering how I can extend org.eclipse.ui.ide.markersupport'
Aug 04 14:47:41 <ipun>	's markerField. The article is here: http://blog.eclipse-tips.com/2008/11/creating-custom-marker-view.html
Aug 04 14:49:47 <nitind>	That's a question to ask only after you've tried it and found out that it doesn't work that way any more.
Aug 04 15:05:30 <ipun>	nitind, i've currently been trying it on an existing extension point, the Problems view. I'm trying to get the "projects" column to display
Aug 04 15:06:26 <nitind>	What does the Problems View have to do with it?
Aug 04 15:07:47 <ipun>	im trying to develop something on the Problems view, so i am trying to get an additional field to come up, more importantly, the projects column to start
Aug 04 15:46:04 <jrtappers>	I seem to be having an issue with classes used for preferences
Aug 04 15:46:33 <jrtappers>	I get null pointers for private static final strings that have the value set immediately
Aug 04 15:46:58 <jrtappers>	private static final FOO = "bar";
Aug 04 15:47:05 <jrtappers>	And then the value later on is null
Aug 04 15:50:47 <nitind>	Where?
Aug 04 15:50:51 <nitind>	Also in a static?
Aug 04 15:54:44 <jrtappers>	Statics and also instance methods
Aug 04 15:55:15 <jrtappers>	Mainly static methods though
Aug 04 15:59:16 <jrtappers>	It seems to be ok if I have a static method that sets the values and manually call it before getting the values [removing the final], but not if it is declared and assigned together, although this seems like a messy workaround
Aug 04 16:11:47 <jrtappers>	Similar example - http://pastebin.com/ZR5EUBkS - On line 64 vals contains 12 nulls
Aug 04 16:12:17 <jrtappers>	It is a similar issue in enums
Aug 04 16:15:27 <jrtappers>	The method [setDefaults()] is called from a method [initializeDefaultPreferences()] which is part of a class registered as a PreferenceInitializer

Aug 05 11:13:06 <davidmichaelkarr>	I'm running Tomcat (TomEE) from Eclipse, and after I renamed a project (cloned, deleted old one), now Tomcat is confused with some sort of JMX error at container startup.  Is there some cache I need to delete?
Aug 05 12:00:13 <nitind>	Gamoder_: Is there a bug report?
Aug 05 12:00:23 <nitind>	davidmichaelkarr: confused how?
Aug 05 12:01:21 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: " java.lang.ClassCastException: Cannot cast org.apache.cxf.management.jmx.InstrumentationManagerImpl to org.apache.cxf.management.InstrumentationManager".  This might be a CXF and/or TomEE problem.  I'm pursuing this on #openejb also.
Aug 05 12:01:49 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: But I didn't see this error before I "renamed" the project (cloned, then deleted old one).
Aug 05 12:01:53 <nitind>	Looks like a classloader problem. Weird.

Aug 09 12:00:07 <davidmichaelkarr>	Ah.  I just had to select the file I wanted added to ignore list.
Aug 09 12:07:57 <davidmichaelkarr>	Curious.  The "Add to svn:ignore" function is clearly bound to "Ctrl+Alt+I", but pressing that key after selecting a resource to be ignored does nothing. You still have to right-click and select the option in the submenu.

Aug 11 01:24:00 <luxigo>	Ok now we have a dark theme after ten years.... but why is it still so much a pain in the sas to darken the background more (I mean to black) and not only the editor window ?  (It's not a question, its an exasperatid sigh...)
Aug 11 01:24:26 <luxigo>	ted
Aug 11 01:24:32 <luxigo>	*SIGH*
Aug 11 04:21:41 <lilalinux>	How do you hide the "Javascript Resources" virtual folder from Project Explorer?
Aug 11 04:21:59 <lilalinux>	It can't be removed via the triangle menu
Aug 11 08:43:14 <NightStrike>	If I want an eclipse IDE that combines CDT and normal java editing, what's the best way to go about putting that together?  I could for instance have two installations (probably the worst choice), I could d/l CDT and try to install Java plugins, I could d/l the basic java ide and try ot install CDT to it, or some other option?
Aug 11 08:52:54 <NightStrike>	Using the installer seems to prefer putting each IDE in a separate directory.... eclipse/cpp-neon and eclipse/java-neon....   but that seems to indicate that I need two very separate IDEs
Aug 11 09:13:11 <lilalinux>	NightStrike: I always find it easier to start with CDT and then possible other stuff
Aug 11 09:42:08 <mpiggott>	With Neon I've started to get a bunch of 'java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xml.namespace.XMLNamespacePackage' while Auto-Saving Workspace. Restarting Eclipse entirely loses the perspective's layout and tiles all the views
Aug 11 09:43:51 <mpiggott>	Also another EMF related stack trace for Oomph 'Setup Check'
Aug 11 10:01:51 <Kakemo>	Hi, I'm coding in C++ with Eclipse and I'm having trouble installing GMP and linking it with Eclipse. Can someone help me ?
Aug 11 10:46:15 <freeone3000>	Hi. On a fresh install of Eclipse Neon, attempting to start it gives me "Eclipse could not start the Virtual Machine. Eclipse will now exit." However, I don't have an error log in the application directory - where should I look for the eclipse logs for this issue?
Aug 11 10:47:30 <freeone3000>	I haven't chosen a workspace yet, so it's not there either.
Aug 11 10:48:07 <mpiggott>	freeone3000, possibly the working directory or ~/.eclipse maybe?
Aug 11 10:49:47 <freeone3000>	mpiggott: No, no logs - it does have infos.txt which lists the JVMs and which one it chose, though, and it's a valid JVM.
Aug 11 10:50:57 <mpiggott>	freeone3000, there is also the cli option -consoleLog https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_Where_can_I_find_that_elusive_.log_file%3F
Aug 11 10:52:45 <freeone3000>	Ah. "Java started but returned exit code 1". And then immediately exits. That's... better, I guess.
Aug 11 11:16:56 <nitind>	freeone3000: "it's a valid JVM" --which one was it?
Aug 11 13:26:52 <freeone3000>	nitind: Oracle 1.8.0 64-bit.
Aug 11 13:31:15 <nitind>	freeone3000: More specific than that?
Aug 11 13:31:53 <freeone3000>	nitind: "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0;1;8;0;64;true;1395170345840"?
Aug 11 13:33:17 <nitind>	freeone3000: I really meant is it the newest 1.8.0, and I trust this is a 64-bit Neon download?
Aug 11 13:35:13 <freeone3000>	nitind: Launcher library is "C:\Users\temp\.p2\pool\plugins\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_64_1.1.400.v20160518-1444". And the JDK is b132, so not *newest* but not terribly old.
Aug 11 13:36:36 <nitind>	From the Command Prompt, are you able to run that installed copy of java.exe?
Aug 11 13:37:33 <freeone3000>	nitind: Yes.
Aug 11 13:37:47 <nitind>	How'd you install Neon?
Aug 11 13:38:14 <freeone3000>	nitind: There was a x64 installer on eclipse.org, co-branded "oomph". I downloaded and ran that.
Aug 11 13:41:39 <nitind>	Have you edited the eclipse.ini file manually?
Aug 11 13:41:48 <freeone3000>	No, this is a fresh install.
Aug 11 14:04:03 <nitind>	Where did it get installed?
Aug 11 14:05:39 <freeone3000>	nitind: C:\Users\temp\eclipse
Aug 11 14:05:47 <freeone3000>	nitind: %HOME% is C:\Users\temp
Aug 11 14:07:30 <nitind>	This launcher library detail, did a dialog pop open with the -1 and bunch of other stuff
Aug 11 14:07:34 <nitind>	?
Aug 11 14:07:57 <freeone3000>	nitind: Yeah, it gave me the error code 1 and the list of launch options.
Aug 11 14:08:12 <nitind>	Can you post the ~image ?

Aug 11 14:38:44 <themiddleman>	hello all
Aug 11 14:41:01 <freeone3000>	nitind: https://imgur.com/a/XVsnP
Aug 11 14:44:08 <nitind>	freeone3000: Can you try editing the c:\Users\temp\eclipse\cpp-neon\eclipse\eclipse.ini file and removing the lines that start with -XX: ?
Aug 11 14:46:59 <freeone3000>	nitind: Alright, that gets me to the splash screen. Thanks.
Aug 11 14:47:19 <themiddleman>	somewhat quick question, my computer had restarted abruptly and it seems as if eclipse doesn't seem to recognize any plugin dependencies I have for my plugin project
Aug 11 14:47:42 <nitind>	dependencies that are in the workspace?
Aug 11 14:49:50 <themiddleman>	err they are for a plugin project
Aug 11 14:50:02 <nitind>	still applies
Aug 11 14:50:27 <themiddleman>	they are more like dependencies that should be with eclipse like org.eclipse.jface
Aug 11 14:50:37 <themiddleman>	or org.eclipse.ui
Aug 11 14:50:59 <nitind>	Information about where those are on-disk might have gone squirrely. From the preference page (Preferences > Plug-in Development > Target Platform), try Removing the Running Platform target definition, Applying, and then Restoring Defaults.
Aug 11 14:51:17 <nitind>	Or, at the last, putting them back the way you'd put them before.
Aug 11 14:52:37 <themiddleman>	ahhh ok thanks that did the trick
Aug 11 14:53:05 <freeone3000>	nitind: Yep, everything's working now! Weird that the -XX were specified by default when they didn't work, thanks.
Aug 12 12:31:42 <Restioson>	Hi. How can I prevent eGit from creating a folder inside of my repo and putting my stuff there instead of at it's root?
Aug 12 14:39:45 <chealer>	hi. when I open a function documentation page from PHP's manual via Content assist proposals, it strangely opens in a small tooltip-like zone in Eclipse rather than in my browser. Is this a known issue and if not, can it open in my browser?
Aug 12 14:41:51 <chealer>	Version 4.6.0 on Windows, with Eclipse set to use Firefox.
Aug 12 16:20:14 <chealer>	I reported in ticket #499629
Aug 13 02:59:19 <upgrdman>	are there any plugins for profiling java program per line (not just per-function time, but "hot spots" with line granularity) ?
Aug 13 11:44:45 <donald>	how to display old projects to the package explorer of eclipse?
Aug 14 02:31:06 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Pardon.. I'm quietly lusing my mind.  When creating an SWT button, there is an autocomplete for adding a selection listener.
Aug 14 02:32:09 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Button b1 = new Button(shell, SWT.PUSH);  b1.addSelectionListener(new SelectionAdapter()   and there is something here that causes Eclipse to offer to add missing methods.

Aug 15 15:45:23 <nitind>	You are impatient, but the answer would have been "yes."
Aug 15 17:15:58 <huck5>	Is there a way in Eclipse, maybe with a plugin, to see/track Java web-application HTTP Requests/Request forwarding?
Aug 15 17:19:22 <nitind>	whose requests? what forwarding?
Aug 15 17:26:24 <huck5>	The project I'm in does a lot of request redirects, which I don't see in my Web Console. Just wondering if there's an easy way to track that from within Eclipse
Aug 15 17:26:39 <huck5>	So say HTML5Controller gets a request... it then just forwards that whole request to another Servlet.
Aug 15 19:53:49 <Bento324>	When I try to create a JUnit Test Case, every time I specify a Class under test, it tells me the Class under test does not exist in current project. It clearly does, because I can browse and find it, and if I manually write the test it works. It won't let me Finish unless I clear out the Class under test. Has anyone else run into this?
Aug 16 04:14:02 <tusharm>	is anyone here experienced with swtbot (test cases for eclipse plugins)? I need some help
Aug 16 04:14:54 <tusharm>	The editors that I have extended from TextEditor are unable to pick up their resource bundles while testing with swtbot but this works when trying it out manually
Aug 16 04:15:07 <tusharm>	even a link to something useful would greatly help
Aug 16 05:02:59 <yin_yang2k>	Is git.eclipse.org down? I can't use the Oomph installer.

Aug 16 14:38:53 <afx_>	Hello ! I am using debian 8 x64 and want to install eclipse-neon . Should I run the installer as root ? also thinking to install it under /opt folder .Is that safe?
Aug 16 14:50:54 <nitind>	It can unnecessarily complicate things, but it should be safe to install (and then *not* run) as root.
Aug 16 14:53:16 <afx_>	nitind, ok currently I get : Artifact download is progressing very slowly from the following hosts . Can be my inet connection , don't know
Aug 16 14:56:32 <afx_>	nitind, can I install it in home dir and then move it to /opt?
Aug 16 14:58:05 <nitind>	yeah, but why?

Aug 17 12:48:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	Zemeio: Opening a file does not require closing anything. Not sure what you mean.
Aug 17 12:49:49 <Zemeio>	When I use open type, it searches on every open project, wanted to know if you guys know how to search only a specific project
Aug 17 13:03:31 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I've got a glitch in my thinking of how projects and packages are managed in Eclipse.
Aug 17 13:03:59 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I can create a project in Eclipse (am using Java).
Aug 17 13:04:06 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I can create a package in that project.
Aug 17 13:04:25 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I believe I can create multiple packages within that project.
Aug 17 13:05:10 <Frigid_Cryotank>	But I do not understand the nomenclature such as packages having names like "com.gs.error", "com.gs.exec", "com.gs.whatever".
Aug 17 13:05:33 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Are each of these sub-packages executables in their own right?
Aug 17 13:06:14 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Or does Eclipse view them as all being required for an executable in the top level project?  (and now I'm not sure I'm phrasing the question properly).

Aug 17 15:00:12 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: A package is just a namespace mechanism, so you can arrange classes in sensible functional groups.  A package is not "executable".
Aug 17 15:25:33 <Frigid_Cryotank>	So if I have multiple source files inside a package, and one source imports a class from another java source file in the same package (namespace) then "all should be well" ...?
Aug 17 15:26:45 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: I don't know about that, but if you reference a class in the same package as the referencing class, you don't have to import it.
Aug 17 15:27:03 <nitind>	Import just lets you use the unqualified name of a type to refer to it, either by importing that type's fully qualified name or all the contents of a package (with the .*). You don't need to import types from the same package--that's the first place the compiler will look for types you refer to anyway.
Aug 17 15:27:58 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Apologies for it being ..cryptic.  What I've been doing is working my way through a tutorial on Java.  Each section of the tutorial has multiple problems... and I was wondering if Eclipse would let me organize all these separate projects into a hierarchy of projects.
Aug 17 15:29:10 <Frigid_Cryotank>	So there would be a "Strings" "project"... and under that would be a Project for the first problem, another for the second problem..
Aug 17 15:29:37 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Which probably looks terrible as far as the filesystem goes... but it's all about organizing things anyway...
Aug 17 15:30:13 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: That's not really practical.  It is possible to use "tasks", or "Mylyn", so that when you're working on the "strings" task, you can limit what you see to projects related to that.
Aug 17 15:30:46 <nitind>	Unless you're going to have projects that aren't for these problems, they're already in a group of sorts by being in a single workspace.
Aug 17 15:37:28 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Re: Mylyn: I'm still plodding my way through simple Java material.  But I think I see the point.  So... having separate projects for all these little problems is the way to go (for the moment).
Aug 17 15:40:07 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I was having a Terrible time with Neon under Slackware Linux.  The default GTK interface has far too much whitespace with the buttons, borders, just everything.  Setting Preferences --> General --> Appearance to "Classic" just didn't work... then found an old post saying "export SWT_GTK3=0"  .. and, oh my, that made Neon extremely responsive.

Aug 18 16:25:19 <defanco>	hello
Aug 18 16:25:20 <Arbalest>	Welcome! If you have a question, just ask, or take a look at our FAQ - http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ :) Try typing ~faq to see more FAQs!

Aug 18 16:29:42 <defanco>	Ran into a bit of an issue with Eclipse that I think could've been avoided. I have a plugin that has Scala nature, other developer checked out this plugin and tries to run it in product, but gets ClassNotFoundException on one of the classes in the plugin. Of course we forget that this plugin has Scala nature and thus expects Scala Builder that we don't have because we don't have Scala IDE installed. The question is why didn't Eclips
Aug 18 16:29:42 <defanco>	e throw some kind of error into Console informing of this fact?
Aug 18 16:31:13 <defanco>	I think these kind of errors are common but hard to diagnose because NoClassFoundException can mean many things being wrong with the plugin
Aug 18 16:36:26 <defanco>	And I think in this particular situation solution is even more simpler since if UI is smart enough to mark Builder as missing, it could go extra step and log warning in the console...
Aug 18 19:14:50 <zave_>	hello, does anyone know what to do about this error "The BPMN Diagram element is not enabled in this Tool Profile"? i think it's the reason why when i drag events into the diagram, they won't stick. am i on the right track?
Aug 19 03:15:54 <jablo>	Swithced to a high-resolution (4K) display. Oh my, now Eclipse is almost unusable due to slooooow scrolling.
Aug 19 03:17:33 <jablo>	I switched from Netbeans to Eclipse for that reason. Now I fear I'll have to switch to Qtcreator (we're a C++/Qt shop).
Aug 19 03:24:20 <mvvvv>	jablo, what is your GPU ?
Aug 19 03:28:47 <jablo>	It's a Dell M3800. GPU is Nvidia Quadro K1100M GPU as far as I know
Aug 19 03:28:52 <jablo>	Linux, Ubuntu 14.04
Aug 19 03:30:28 <jablo>	Oh - I'm using X.Org X server -- Nouveau display driver. Maybe I should try the NVIDIA binary driver.
Aug 19 03:42:31 <jablo>	No. Even using NVIDIA binary driver, mouse-wheel scrolling is horribly slow. Eclipse can't keep up and is lagging 10s of seconds behind.
Aug 19 03:43:01 <jablo>	(sigh. I hate QtCreator and only use it when I absolutely have to in some debug sessions)
Aug 19 03:44:46 <mvvvv>	jablo, do you know what is your kernel version ?
Aug 19 03:45:14 <jablo>	Linux jl 3.16.0-77-generic #99~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jun 28 19:17:10 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Aug 19 03:45:18 <lookshe>	how can i skip the unnecessary local repository when cloning a git repository from eclipse?
Aug 19 03:46:52 <mvvvv>	jablo, I know that kernel 4.4 (ubuntu 16.04) has  dramatically enhanced the free video drivers
Aug 19 03:48:30 <jablo>	Oh. Interesting. Maybe that's a reason for upgrading (ie. re-installing), I was thinking of waiting for the .1 release and do an in-place upgrade instead. Hmm,.
Aug 19 03:49:20 <jablo>	QtCreator in comparison is lightning fast. Netbeans was horribly slow even on normal HD resolution. Eclipse is nice and fast on HD resolution, but can't keep up on 4K
Aug 19 03:49:22 <mvvvv>	jablo, on the other hand I've seen many problems with nvidia drivers on 16.04
Aug 19 03:49:34 <jablo>	Oh, the joy of upgrading :)(
Aug 19 03:50:41 <mvvvv>	jablo, To evaluate my driver I test some webgl experiments (looking for the highter FPS)
Aug 19 03:59:26 <jablo>	Well, glxgears full screen 4K gives 196 fps
Aug 19 04:00:57 <jablo>	With 97% idle cpu... I guess all work is done on the GPU :)
Aug 19 04:01:56 <mvvvv>	sounds good yes
Aug 19 04:04:23 <mvvvv>	jablo, did you tried SWT_GTK3=0 before launching eclipse ?
Aug 19 04:11:52 <jablo>	wvvvv set SWT_GTK3=0  as an environment variable before starting eclipse?
Aug 19 04:12:14 <mvvvv>	Yes to use GTK2 libs instead of GTK3
Aug 19 04:12:31 <mvvvv>	this workaround can save performance
Aug 19 04:12:48 <jablo>	wvvvv, now wow, THAT really helps!
Aug 19 04:13:53 <mvvvv>	ok so because of old ubuntu 14.04 you have this old problem. Ubuntu 16.04 + eclipse neon have fix this
Aug 19 04:19:38 <jablo>	wvvvv, thanks a lot. (now wondering if this or a similar solution is possible for Netbeans)
Aug 19 04:20:48 <mvvvv>	jablo, don't think cause Netbeans do not use GTK
Aug 19 04:25:30 <jablo>	I really need to clean up my workflow. I love Eclipse for editing C++ files, and need to use QtCreator for debugging when there's a need to inspect and evaluate Qt data structures, but I use Netbeans for resolving git merge/rebase conflicts.
Aug 19 04:25:43 <jablo>	what a mess
Aug 19 04:26:23 <mvvvv>	egit on eclipse is nice
Aug 19 04:28:58 <jablo>	Hmm. I rarely dare use guis for git commands. Most git commands I use the command line - then for conflict resolution I like Netbeans graphical representation. I'm a strange person, I guess.
Aug 19 04:37:01 <jablo>	Thanks anyway for speeding up my Eclipse! You've really made my day, wvvvv
Aug 19 08:39:49 <dimm>	hello, community!
Aug 19 08:40:19 <dimm>	can't run eclipse with '-xms2048M -xmx2048M'
Aug 19 08:40:28 <dimm>	only with 1024M working
Aug 19 08:41:01 <dimm>	is this possible to run eclipse more than 1024M '-vm'?
Aug 19 09:04:56 <dimm>	solved
Aug 19 09:05:09 <dimm>	it was trouble with free ram on pc :-)
Aug 19 09:54:32 <dimm>	not solved
Aug 19 09:54:43 <dimm>	is somebody have the same error?
Aug 19 09:55:45 <Stummi>	dimm, are you on 32 bit?
Aug 19 09:56:11 <Stummi>	-Xms500m -Xmx4g in eclipse.ini works fine for me
Aug 19 09:58:25 <dimm>	not 32 bit, "mixed mode" as far as i understand it is 64bit
Aug 19 10:00:36 <Stummi>	dimm, which OS?
Aug 19 10:00:46 <dimm>	windows 7
Aug 19 10:01:06 <dimm>	omg, it seems like if it 64bit, then must say about it... it seems like i on 32bit
Aug 19 10:01:42 <Stummi>	dimm, what does "java -version" say?
Aug 19 10:01:49 <Stummi>	(last line)
Aug 19 10:02:37 <dimm>	ah, my project must on 32bit
Aug 19 10:03:04 <dimm>	Stummi: sorry, developer was close window... i wait for information
Aug 19 10:03:27 <dimm>	Stummi: i just say that it is 1.6.0_24
Aug 19 10:03:47 <dimm>	Stummi: and have not '64-bit' words on 'java-version'
Aug 19 10:05:48 <Stummi>	1.6.0 is pretty old
Aug 19 10:06:01 <dimm>	yeah :-)
Aug 19 10:06:13 <dimm>	we have some restrictions there
Aug 19 10:06:35 <Stummi>	the restriction to stick to software versions with security issues?
Aug 19 10:06:43 <davidmichaelkarr>	dimm: And have you determined for certain that you're on a 64-bit OS?
Aug 19 10:07:07 <davidmichaelkarr>	Were there 64-bit OSes when 1.6 was released? :)
Aug 19 10:07:22 <Stummi>	well, when java -version does not mention its 64 bit, the platform is irrelevant anyway. Its a 32 bit jvm
Aug 19 10:07:55 <Stummi>	and a 32 bit jvm cannot take more than 2gb (minus some overhead)
Aug 19 10:08:17 <davidmichaelkarr>	dimm: It's worthwhile to point out that even if you're required to use 1.6 for your application, there should be nothing wrong with using the latest JDK to run Eclipse.
Aug 19 10:09:05 <Stummi>	can the current eclipse even run with 1.6?
Aug 19 10:09:11 <davidmichaelkarr>	The best I was able to get on 32-bit windows was 1536mb.
Aug 19 10:09:38 <dimm>	thank you, guyz

Aug 19 18:04:31 <motaka2>	hello from where I can download the latest version of eclipse for linux. I look for the url
Aug 19 18:05:30 <davidmichaelkarr>	motaka2: Just go to https://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php and follow the Download links.
Aug 19 18:06:04 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: i know but I am on a windows machine
Aug 19 18:06:12 <motaka2>	it just suggests me exe

Aug 19 18:38:52 <juacado>	Hi, I'm working in an Eclipse CDT Makefile project, I've added a new make target named 'install' (in the makefile and Make Target inspector) to copy some files to /usr/local/ but when I double-click it I get a 'Permission denied' error (as it's obvious)
Aug 19 18:39:20 <juacado>	so I added a sudo before cp, then I get 'no tty present and no askpass program specified' error
Aug 19 18:39:36 <juacado>	any suggestion that doesn't involve to tweak sudoers file?
Aug 19 19:19:44 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: have you seen this?
Aug 19 19:20:33 <davidmichaelkarr>	motaka2: ?
Aug 19 19:20:47 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: sorry http://www.eclipse.org/rap/
Aug 19 19:21:36 <davidmichaelkarr>	motaka2: Nope, never seen that.
Aug 19 19:22:00 <motaka2>	is there anything wrong with using this for an enterprise project
Aug 19 19:22:00 <motaka2>	?
Aug 19 19:27:11 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: :)
Aug 19 19:30:46 <davidmichaelkarr>	motaka2: Are you really asking me whether I think a tool that I just said I've never heard of is viable to use for projects?
Aug 19 19:32:18 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: yes. I am from php background and I am in primitive steps of creating an automation app with java. every bit of info will be apreciated
Aug 20 07:02:43 <jayaura>	Hi, I have a project that is created in windows. I looked at one of the SDK env vars, and was a windows path. I changed it to linux path. But the change is not reflected in projectinfo.xml How do I regenerate the file ?
Aug 20 07:03:09 <jayaura>	sorry, forgot to mention that I am on linux
Aug 20 08:23:30 <ZeekL>	Heyas, a asset view question.  Using Neon right now.  I have a jar in my Reference Libraries which has some json assets.  When I try to view them it says "Problem opening an editor.  Problem opening editor for 'sample.json': 'System editor can only open file based resources'.  Is there a setting or add on which can let me view those asset resources?
Aug 20 13:13:33 <juacado>	is it not possible to upgrade Mars to Neon? do Ineed to install from scratch?
Aug 20 14:22:55 <davidmichaelkarr>	juacado: believe so, yes.
Aug 20 14:24:14 <Gaulouis>	Hello,
Aug 20 14:24:23 <Gaulouis>	Q: How to install maven plugin ?
Aug 20 14:24:36 <Gaulouis>	I would like to install antlr4-maven-plugin
Aug 20 17:52:46 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Am using Neon and have run into a weird ..thing.  What does it mean when the editor text cursor flips between red and black on a source line?
Aug 20 19:33:29 <motaka2>	has anyone here seen eclipse RAP and scout ? what do you think of it ?
Aug 20 22:35:04 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Is there a way to get the Project Explorer in Eclipse Neon to sort by time/date ?
Aug 20 23:10:48 <thatGuy__>	hello, anyone here?
Aug 21 00:02:58 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: No.
Aug 21 00:03:16 <Frigid_Cryotank>	davidmichaelkarr: Thank you.
Aug 21 00:03:46 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: But note that there are plugins that allow you to open OS file explorer window in the same location.
Aug 21 00:05:31 <Frigid_Cryotank>	<sigh>  Installed Ecipse last Monday... too many plugins.. will check to see if there is a Linux equivalent.
Aug 21 00:11:18 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: Haven't used it, but <https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/open-explorer> appears to do that.
Aug 21 00:11:47 <Frigid_Cryotank>	davidmichaelkarr: Thank you. I'll take a look.
Aug 21 09:39:59 <juacado>	Hi, Eclipse Neon doesn't restart (File menu > Restart), it just quits Eclipse but never launches it again, am I the only one? (I'm using Ubuntu 16.04)
Aug 21 09:40:14 <juacado>	I can't seem to find anything related to that :/
Aug 21 10:02:15 <davidmichaelkarr>	juacado: first, have you turned off gtk3?
Aug 21 11:25:39 <juacado>	davidmichaelkarr, do you mean "Exec=env SWT_GTK3=0 eclipse"? I thought that was only for Mars :)
Aug 21 11:25:42 <juacado>	Thanks for the tip
Aug 21 11:46:09 <davidmichaelkarr>	juacado: There are different ways to do it. I don't know for sure if the GTK3 problems still persist on Neon.  I'd be surprised if it was fixed in Neon.
Aug 21 11:49:21 <juacado>	I added that line to my eclipse.desktop and it works now
Aug 21 14:55:15 <juacado>	I'm in a Makefile project, I've included <memory>, and then in the code I'm using std::shared_ptr, but it's underlined in red and says 'Symbol 'shared_ptr' could not be resolved' so I can't compile from the IDE...
Aug 21 14:55:28 <juacado>	however I can compile from command line with no issues...
Aug 21 14:55:41 <juacado>	I tried rebuilding the index, but no luck :/
Aug 21 14:56:13 <juacado>	in the makefile I'm using -std=c++11
Aug 21 16:15:49 <jablo>	juacado can eclipse find the include file <memory> ? Ie. can you Ctrl-leftclick on  <memory>  and have eclipse open the header file?
Aug 21 17:53:56 <al_nz1>	SO is M2Eclipse already installed in 4.6
Aug 21 18:00:49 <motaka2>	is eclipse RAP a good thing to create tools with it ?
Aug 21 18:05:13 <al_nz1>	But when I go to Run As Maven on a pom file I get "No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?"
Aug 21 18:05:22 <al_nz1>	but i have added the jdk

Aug 22 09:11:45 <sam__>	mvvvv: do you have any idea on that ?
Aug 22 09:11:58 <mvvvv>	sam__, I guess that upgrade to a newest version of eclipse (Neon or Mars) is the solution to this bug :(
Aug 22 09:12:49 <sam__>	so, we can't apply a patch for that ?
Aug 22 09:13:57 <mvvvv>	not for eclipse 4.3

Aug 22 12:50:09 <enleeten>	but make sure to back everything up before editing :)
Aug 22 12:50:40 <guest___>	there is no .project file in the GIT. I am creating new one from scratch during import
Aug 22 12:53:29 <enleeten>	does the git repo contain svn metadata? like a .svn folder?
Aug 22 12:53:48 <guest___>	No, it does not
Aug 22 13:01:26 <guest___>	Ok, I was able to "Import as a general project" and then convert . Still, "import as new" does not work :-(
Aug 22 14:40:40 <Sash>	Hi, in the release note there was the feature announced that neon supports hidpi screens. hot do I activate it (linux, running kde)? right now text and icons are tiny (look unscaled)
Aug 22 15:03:38 <badloop>	so, is it possible to create an eclipse project it a git repository without it having a toplevel folder in the project?
Aug 22 15:03:49 <badloop>	*in a git repository
Aug 22 15:04:15 <nitind>	Too many "it"s.
Aug 22 15:05:12 <badloop>	so many
Aug 22 15:05:15 <badloop>	:-P
Aug 22 15:06:47 <nitind>	Maybe an ~image would help?
Aug 22 15:06:47 <Arbalest>	Please upload your screenshots online and then paste the link back to the channel - http://imgur.com/ - http://imagebin.ca/
Aug 22 15:07:03 <badloop>	screenshot of what?
Aug 22 15:07:16 <nitind>	What it looks like and what it should look like.
Aug 22 15:07:25 <badloop>	ah ok
Aug 22 15:07:29 <badloop>	one sec
Aug 22 15:08:20 <nitind>	Usually the new project wizard offers a "Location" field, possibly in an Advanced section, to let you put the project directory anywhere you want.
Aug 22 15:11:56 <badloop>	essentially, i dont want a project folder in the repo
Aug 22 15:12:05 <badloop>	i just want the *contents* of the project folder in the repo
Aug 22 15:14:06 <badloop>	perhaps i should revisit how i'm storing the data on my server
Aug 22 15:23:42 <Sash>	just in case anyone has the same problem as me (the hidpi issue). that fixed it: "echo Xft.dpi: 190 | xrdb -merge" replace 190 with the right setting for your screen
Aug 22 16:25:07 <cores>	hidpi issue?
Aug 22 17:35:24 <cjoseph>	Hi, I have a project that I imported as an existing git repository a couple months ago. At the time the project was mostly python, but today we added a java folder to the repository
Aug 22 17:35:48 <cjoseph>	what is the best way to add the java nature?
Aug 22 17:36:23 <cjoseph>	is it possible to have a second .project file for this java subfolder?
Aug 22 17:37:03 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: Best to have them as separate projects.
Aug 22 17:37:20 <cjoseph>	I cannot separate them into two git repositories
Aug 22 17:37:24 <cjoseph>	so how will that work?
Aug 22 17:38:28 <cjoseph>	(a higher power than I has decreed that the java and python code shall exist in the same repo)
Aug 22 17:49:39 <nitind>	Are you saying the entire repository is one project in the workspace?  Is the folder in question already being treated as a project?
Aug 22 17:50:21 <cjoseph>	yes
Aug 22 17:50:26 <cjoseph>	nitind: yes
Aug 22 17:50:39 <cjoseph>	I used the "import git" wizard
Aug 22 17:51:02 <cjoseph>	at the time basically everything was python
Aug 22 17:51:38 <cjoseph>	now the existing python/git project has a new java subdirectory
Aug 22 17:52:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: And what is your intention for how the Python code and the Java code would interact?  Would they even be part of the same deployment artifact?
Aug 22 17:53:35 <cjoseph>	they will not interact, but the python code doesn't exist in a neat "python" subdirectory
Aug 22 17:54:00 <cjoseph>	there are half a dozen folders containing python code and this one new java folder
Aug 22 17:54:40 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: So at runtime they are effectively completely separate, and you've decided to essentially lump all the code together, even though they will have nothing to do with each other at runtime?
Aug 22 17:55:27 <cjoseph>	yes
Aug 22 17:55:34 <cjoseph>	as I explained earlier, I have no control over this
Aug 22 17:56:04 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: Yeah, whatever.  Good luck.\
Aug 22 17:56:15 <cjoseph>	thanks?
Aug 22 17:56:20 <cjoseph>	that was very unhelpful
Aug 22 17:56:48 <cjoseph>	everyone else wants to keep the code in one place
Aug 22 18:00:12 <cjoseph>	and I'm trying to find the best way to deal with this decision
Aug 22 18:00:44 <nitind>	Right clikc on the project in the Project Explorer or Navigator and look under the Configure menu.
Aug 22 18:01:56 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: nitind might be able to help you hack together a solution, but lumping all the code into a single project just makes all of it harder to manage.  Bad decision.  Look up "separation of concerns" sometime.
Aug 22 18:02:23 <cjoseph>	nitind: I see options to convert the project to a faceted form, tex, wikitext or javascript ptoject.
Aug 22 18:03:08 <cjoseph>	davidmichaelkarr: it's multiple projects in a single git repository which is somewhat different
Aug 22 18:03:12 <nitind>	Faceted form might allow it to then become a Java project.
Aug 22 18:03:42 <cjoseph>	is there any way to import the subfolder as a new java project?
Aug 22 18:04:23 <nitind>	A subfolder in an existing project?
Aug 22 18:04:28 <cjoseph>	davidmichaelkarr: and you are talking to me as if I made this decision personally, which I did not. I don't need to look up separation of concerns
Aug 22 18:04:34 <cjoseph>	your saltiness is not appreciated
Aug 22 18:05:17 <cjoseph>	nitind: yes...no idea if that's possible but if it is it seems like an easy solution.
Aug 22 18:05:28 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: Doesn't matter who made it.
Aug 22 18:05:32 <nitind>	I don't think that is supported.
Aug 22 18:07:07 <cjoseph>	davidmichaelkarr: lol yes it does, but whatever. enjoy your hobby of harassing people for things outside of their control on an IRC channel
Aug 22 18:07:30 <cjoseph>	I appreciated your initial advice, however.

Aug 23 03:29:00 <mistria>	eahmedshendy: yes, you can; although I don't know whereas there are many Che users here ATM
Aug 23 03:31:54 <eahmedshendy>	I can only find docker, vargant or yatta as a way of installation

Aug 23 06:00:18 <duelle>	Hi, how can I close only one window of eclipse in i3wm without closing the whole eclipse application?
Aug 23 06:00:44 <duelle>	(Eclipse Neon, Arch Linux, i3wm)
Aug 23 06:21:49 <mistria>	duelle: no issue with other window systems, maybe ask the i3wm community
Aug 23 06:54:42 <duelle>	mistria: Thanks for the hint. But there is no button (apart from the [x] that is not displayed in i3) that closes just the current window (or something similar)?
Aug 23 06:56:09 <mistria>	duelle: I'm not sure I understand the question. Eclipse just looks like other mainstream apps such as Thunderbird, Gimp... regarding buttons on my machine. See screenshots on other WM to figure it out and see how it is different in i3wm
Aug 23 07:00:07 <duelle>	mistria: I have eclipse neon with two windows opened and I can't find a way to close only one window. When I use File->Exit both windows close and when restarting eclipse both windows are back again. I am missing a way/shortcut/button to close one of the windows. As far as I can remember from using xfce this was possible with using the [x] on the titlebar - though there is no such button on the title bar
Aug 23 07:00:13 <duelle>	in tiling wms. I found a similar 'issue' at stackexchange for fvwm (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4812868/how-to-close-an-open-window-of-eclipse) which unfortunately is not applicable for i3wm. What I am looking for is another option/menu entry to close just one window.
Aug 23 07:58:21 <jrtappers>	How would I change how collapsed code looks? My plugin collapses code correctly, but I want it to show only the first line, not the first and last
Aug 23 08:47:45 <Marcel_>	fuck
Aug 23 08:47:47 <Marcel_>	really
Aug 23 08:47:53 <Marcel_>	is there anyone???
Aug 23 10:53:38 <ttwhy>	hey there, is the RDT (remote development tool) usable for every language (e.g. Java with ant files?)
Aug 23 11:29:39 <davidmichaelkarr>	Sigh.  I started up Eclipse on my VM this morning, and I found that the workspace was corrupted.  It didn't seem to think that I had projects in it, even though it tried to restore my last edited files, which presented exceptions when I tried to do anything with them, as it couldn't find the files (even though I can clearly see them when I browse the
Aug 23 11:29:39 <davidmichaelkarr>	workspace outside of Eclipse). This kind of thing happened to me a lot last year, but almost everything is different.  About the only similarity is that I'm running Eclipse in a VM.
Aug 23 17:09:59 <juacado>	How come Eclipse CDT on Neon platform and Ubuntu 16.04 is drawing a red line under shared_ptr and saying 'Symbol could not be resolved'? However it compiles successfully inside the IDE and in command line
Aug 23 17:10:10 <juacado>	I think I've tried everything possible :(
Aug 23 17:47:23 <Abri>	it's on meth
Aug 24 01:23:43 <Amis>	Hello! I'm on Neon (4.6.0) and (C++) when declaring instances of classes Eclipse never offers me any proposals for the expected constructor arguments. This feature never actually worked for me. Is this a bug that's been in the code forever or I have something turned off.
Aug 24 01:24:04 <Amis>	Other proposals work fine and I see this bug has been posted a long time ago and marked as fixed.
Aug 24 01:28:28 <Amis>	Note: code proposal for constructors work when objects are created with "new"
Aug 24 01:28:34 <Amis>	But it does not when created on stack
Aug 24 03:47:51 <juacado>	Amis, what do you mean exactly, for example, that you define a custom constructor with a float as argument and then you hit ctrl+space and nothing shows up?
Aug 24 03:49:10 <Amis>	juacado, a sec, I create an example
Aug 24 03:50:54 <Amis>	juacado, http://pastebin.com/SMgramCE  if I press Ctrl+Space at the last character it does not give me anything.
Aug 24 03:51:28 <Amis>	Howere if I do ---   MyClass * inst = new MyClass(      then it does give me the proper contructor
Aug 24 03:52:39 <juacado>	that's weird, it works for my both ways
Aug 24 03:52:52 <juacado>	I don't know what the problem can be
Aug 24 03:56:01 <Amis>	I just created a brand new workspace with a brand new project and it worked for the first time ONLY. It showed up once but after that it doesn't show hints anymore.
Aug 24 03:58:27 <Amis>	Well yeah this is bullpoo. After restarting that workspace the code completition doesn't even work anymore :V
Aug 24 04:00:34 <Amis>	Oh, it's probably because it's downloading some silly update and that prevents the hint from starting at all
Aug 24 04:18:16 <juacado>	Amis, a different type of question, are you using C++11 features?
Aug 24 04:18:39 <Amis>	juacado, yes
Aug 24 04:19:18 <juacado>	do you have problems with, for example, std::shraed_ptr being underlined in red but the code still compiles succesfully?
Aug 24 05:53:32 <SimonKLB>	hi! anyone know how to make eclipse wrap the first method parameter to a new line if its too long?
Aug 24 05:53:53 <SimonKLB>	i am able to wrap the other parameters, but the first one seem to stick on the same line as the method name
Aug 24 05:56:28 <SimonKLB>	ah, and this is when having the method parameters line up by column, otherwise it's fine as well

Aug 24 09:05:03 <ImNotQ009>	Hello. I'm having a litle problem with the C/C++ IDE. I'm trying to get code indexer to work but it seems it fails to index all of the C++ stuff (like std::strings)
Aug 24 09:05:07 <ImNotQ009>	Any tips, please?
Aug 24 09:05:29 <ImNotQ009>	I'm using Eclipse 4.4
Aug 24 09:08:23 <ImNotQ009>	I added include directories for C and C++ libs in the project settings
Aug 24 09:08:30 <ImNotQ009>	It is finding includes just fine
Aug 24 09:35:25 <mistria>	ImNotQ009: hi, first, use the latest version (Neon, 4.6) of Eclipse IDE for C++ developers. Many things are improved from a version to another and maybe your issue has been worked on during the timeframe
Aug 24 09:35:47 <mistria>	ImNotQ009: you'll have much trouble to find people to give you support on older version on this channel
Aug 24 09:36:43 <ImNotQ009>	mistria: I
Aug 24 09:36:46 <ImNotQ009>	mistria: I'm afraid I can
Aug 24 09:37:07 <ImNotQ009>	*sigh* I'm sorry, I keep pressing enter when I mean to press the apostrophe
Aug 24 09:37:22 <ImNotQ009>	What I meant to say is that I can't use the latest version, because it's buggy for me
Aug 24 09:37:45 <ImNotQ009>	The interface is painfully slow and I experience a lot of line rendering issues
Aug 24 09:37:51 <ImNotQ009>	It's a known bug, I found a report about it
Aug 24 09:38:05 <mistria>	ImNotQ009: which os are you using?
Aug 24 09:38:09 <ImNotQ009>	Ubuntu
Aug 24 09:38:12 <ImNotQ009>	14.04 LTS
Aug 24 09:43:24 <davidmichaelkarr>	ImNotQ009: turn off gtk3.
Aug 24 09:44:40 <ImNotQ009>	Anyway, I fixed the problem, I had a couple things lacking
Aug 24 09:45:13 <ImNotQ009>	davidmichaelkarr: will try next time around, cheers
Aug 24 09:57:30 <Tazmain>	hi all, is there a way for eclipse's web page editor to pick up css and stuff for the preview it shows ?
Aug 24 09:59:32 <Tazmain>	or the web browser to set it up to know where to load the css from
Aug 24 10:01:01 <mistria>	Tazmain: Aren't you using relative path to the CSS file?
Aug 24 10:01:40 <Tazmain>	in this case no.

Aug 24 10:02:58 <Tazmain>	A css profile might work
Aug 24 16:45:18 <juacado>	Hi Amis, did you solve your problem with code completion?
Aug 24 19:37:56 <ISmithers>	Does anyone here use Eclipse to connect to Salesforce orgs via the Force.com plugin?
Aug 25 00:59:24 <Amis>	juacado, nope
Aug 25 00:59:58 <Amis>	juacado, regardig your last question: do you have problems with, for example, std::shraed_ptr being underlined in red but the code still compiles succesfully?
Aug 25 01:00:26 <Amis>	No, I had to set some defines and flags here and there in eclipse to make it work but it knows C++11 now
Aug 25 03:57:46 <juacado>	same as me Amis, it's a bit annoying that it doesn't work just by adding -std=c++11 to the compiler options
Aug 25 04:01:06 <juacado>	in my case the application compiles succesfully and can be launched, the annoying thing is that I get that red line under shared_ptr and an error message saying that Symbol couldn't be resolved
Aug 25 04:13:27 <Amis>	juacado, you have to configure C++11 in the indexer aswell

Aug 25 05:44:03 <dethegeek>	Hi all
Aug 25 05:45:09 <dethegeek>	I switched to Ecliose Neon a few weeks ago, and I noticed I can no longer split the editor view to show 2 different files side by side
Aug 25 09:26:58 <jablo>	In Eclipse-neon the button to terminate a running build (make) seems to be gone!?!??!?
Aug 25 09:30:41 <mvvvv>	jablo, And with the "Task" view ?
Aug 25 09:31:51 <jablo>	He - right now I am stuck with a modal window saying "User Operation is Waiting"... and no way to stop the running build (which is long). I am thinking of going to the command line and "killall eclipse"
Aug 25 09:34:44 <mvvvv>	what is the eclipse package you use ?
Aug 25 09:35:48 <jablo>	Eclipse CDT - strangely enough, now the button is back (the progress window). Hmmm.
Aug 25 09:39:01 <mvvvv>	jablo, may be this can help :http://kaloyanraev.blogspot.fr/2016/04/why-does-building-workspace-block.html
Aug 25 09:39:12 <jablo>	Yes - now again, doing a "build project", I cannot stop the build from the "Progress" tab. The red stop button is gone again.
Aug 25 09:41:15 <jablo>	very annoying
Aug 25 09:41:28 <mvvvv>	what about the link I gave you
Aug 25 09:41:30 <mvvvv>	?
Aug 25 09:42:43 <jablo>	Well, that would help for the situation I was in - except that since I am working in C++, it makes sense to wait for builders. Normally I would be able to *stop* the build from that dialog, which is fine. But now in Neon it seems not possible.
Aug 25 09:43:27 <jablo>	Oh, now suddenly after quite a while, the res "stop" button is back on the progress tab. Odd.
Aug 25 09:44:06 <mvvvv>	what is the value in preferences/ Run Debug / Launching/ Wait for ongoing build .... ?
Aug 25 09:45:12 <jablo>	"Never"
Aug 25 09:45:21 <mvvvv>	so ... Prompt ?
Aug 25 09:46:52 <jablo>	Hmm - my goal really is to be able to stop a running build.
Aug 25 09:47:08 <mvvvv>	and with prompt ?
Aug 25 09:47:29 <jablo>	mvvv, LOL - alright alright - :-D
Aug 25 09:47:38 <mvvvv>	^_^
Aug 25 09:49:01 <jablo>	Then the red "Stop" button seems to be consistently there in the Progress tab from the start of my build. Nice.

Aug 29 11:06:40 <mistria>	Lone_Rifle mvvvv: https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ecafaq.php , the Eclipse contributor License agreement has to be signed on the Eclipse Profile page https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/myaccount.php#open_tab_cla
Aug 29 11:07:49 <mvvvv>	mistria For Github ??
Aug 29 11:08:32 <mistria>	mvvvv: I believe so, IIRC, Eclipse adds an additional IP check which verifies one has signed the Eclipse Contributor Agreement
Aug 29 11:08:50 <mistria>	mvvvv: it's reported like a test pass or failure
Aug 29 11:10:01 <mistria>	mvvvvv: see https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/2234 for an example, the "ip-validation" at the bottom
Aug 29 11:10:16 <mistria>	mvvvv: though this one is not about ECA
Aug 29 11:12:41 <enleeten>	could it be something with that new contributor agreement?
Aug 29 11:13:59 <enleeten>	nm missed the bottom comments due to scrollback
Aug 29 12:24:42 <TML>	Is there a way to make "Eclipse Intaller.app" use my existing, fully functional JDK instead of looking for Apple's unsupported, legacy 1.6 JDK?
Aug 29 15:40:52 <purplex88>	In Eclipse Java, If I type 'S' it brings up a long autocomplete list of stuff that starts with 'S' and when I press backspace to delete 'S' the autocomplete list doesn't go away.
Aug 29 15:41:28 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Press Escape.
Aug 29 15:42:31 <purplex88>	can i make it work with backpace?
Aug 29 15:42:45 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: No.
Aug 29 15:42:49 <purplex88>	list still being there seems unnecessary if i delete it
Aug 29 15:45:39 <nitind>	Did you set it to automatically show the list when you type 'S'?
Aug 29 15:47:11 <purplex88>	i have set all the alphabetic characters under Windows menu -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Content assist
Aug 29 20:36:47 <Keitaro>	hello is there anybody here plz ?
Aug 29 20:37:30 <Keitaro>	i have a problem on eclipse when i try to build the project it said : cannot find -lpthread
Aug 29 20:37:33 <IstiCusi>	Keitaro: yes
Aug 29 20:38:03 <Keitaro>	c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/5.3.0/../../../../mingw32/bin/ld.exe: cannot find -lpthread
Aug 29 20:38:10 <Keitaro>	i don't know why
Aug 29 20:38:35 <IstiCusi>	sorry, no idea
Aug 29 20:38:38 <Keitaro>	i install mingw with the installer and use eclipse last version for C/C++ dev
Aug 29 20:39:06 <Keitaro>	if i am on windows 64 bit mingw 32 bit works ?
Aug 29 20:39:15 <Keitaro>	or did i have to take the 64 one ?
Aug 30 07:47:05 <greenit>	hi, i have two folders which have identical things in it. one is a svn-synchronized folder, the other one is a linked folder to a share. I need both to be on the same state. is it somehow possible to automatically get all changes i make in one of the folders in the other one too?
Aug 30 07:47:25 <greenit>	both are imported into eclipse
Aug 30 08:42:30 <sasadw4748>	hello?
