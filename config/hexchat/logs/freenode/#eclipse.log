Jul 26 05:47:29 <CustosL1men>	O
Jul 26 05:58:02 <mistria>	CustosL1men: do you know how to build this project without Eclipse?
Jul 26 06:11:05 <CustosL1men>	mistria, I guess I can hack something out with javac
Jul 26 06:12:34 <CustosL1men>	let me get a file tree
Jul 26 06:12:43 <mistria>	CustosL1men: Eclipse builds automatically, All you have to do is to set the right classpath
Jul 26 06:13:14 <CustosL1men>	mistria, where is the output of build ?
Jul 26 06:13:35 <mistria>	CustosL1men: classes are usually in the bin/ folder
Jul 26 06:14:20 <mistria>	CustosL1men: if you want the jar, you have to use File > Export > Jar File
Jul 26 06:15:25 <CustosL1men>	http://termbin.com/n2zc
Jul 26 06:19:42 <mistria>	CustosL1men: ok, and what are you trying to achieve exactly?
Jul 26 06:19:57 <CustosL1men>	mistria, I want to build jar
Jul 26 06:20:02 <CustosL1men>	mistria, but what you suggested did wokr
Jul 26 06:20:04 <CustosL1men>	mistria, but what you suggested did work
Jul 26 06:20:11 <CustosL1men>	export jar
Jul 26 06:49:32 <samuel_m>	mistria: thanks for the hint about reporting a bug yesterday, just did that: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=498487
Jul 26 08:39:25 <BadApe>	what is eclipse neon? is it just a new naming scheme?
Jul 26 08:47:37 <CustosL1men>	BadApe, neon is the version/release name
Jul 26 08:50:19 <BadApe>	no more releases like pluto, i guess maybe they ran out of names
Jul 26 09:28:27 <raddy>	Hello Everybody
Jul 26 09:28:41 <raddy>	This is not directly related to eclipse
Jul 26 09:29:02 <raddy>	But people who have experience in Java can try to help

Jul 26 11:45:43 <CustosL1men>	can I do non graphical install for eclipse ?
Jul 26 11:47:27 <mistria>	CustosL1men: Depends on what you want to do, Eclipse can be extended to load without UI, but it's not part of the default packages
Jul 26 11:48:01 <CustosL1men>	actually - I want to build eclipse stuff from command line
Jul 26 11:48:06 <strykerawb>	mistria,  PM
Jul 26 11:48:13 <CustosL1men>	so I downloaded eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz (neon version)
Jul 26 11:48:35 <CustosL1men>	but when I run ./eclipse-installer/eclipse-inst I get graphical installer
Jul 26 11:48:40 <CustosL1men>	I want non graphical installer
Jul 26 11:48:48 <CustosL1men>	or if I can have non installer based eclipse it will also be fine
Jul 26 11:50:24 <mistria>	CustosL1men: ok, those are packages. From http://eclipse.org/downloads, there's a small link behind the installer
Jul 26 11:50:35 <CustosL1men>	ok thanks
Jul 26 11:50:40 <mistria>	CustosL1men: you can directly download zip/tars
Jul 26 11:50:41 <CustosL1men>	let me give it a go
Jul 26 11:51:17 <mistria>	CustosL1men: if you're on a recent and developer friendly Linux distro such as Fedora, there a native packages available with dnf
Jul 26 11:51:21 <mistria>	or apt
Jul 26 11:51:26 <CustosL1men>	mistria, on gentoo
Jul 26 11:51:34 <CustosL1men>	mistria, there are native packages but I dont like them
Jul 26 11:51:49 <mistria>	CustosL1men: don't think there's something recent on Gentoo
Jul 26 12:12:57 <CustosL1men>	so this builds classes hnb eclipse-neon eclipse -nosplash -data "${HOME}/eclipse-workspace/" -application org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core.aptBuild
Jul 26 12:13:04 <CustosL1men>	but not sure how to get it to build jar
Jul 26 12:18:22 <mistria>	CustosL1men: you can try the antBuilder application, and pass an Ant build.xml file
Jul 26 12:20:35 <CustosL1men>	cant I somehow get maven to build eclipse projects ?
Jul 26 12:26:38 <mistria>	CustosL1men: what do you ,mean bu Eclipse projects? Eclipse plugins? or regular Java projects?
Jul 26 12:28:00 <CustosL1men>	mistria, regular java projects like this: http://termbin.com/wbut
Jul 26 12:29:28 <mistria>	CustosL1men: ok, so yes, they can be built with Maven. But this task is independent from the IDE. The IDE can help and will understand Maven, but once your project is Maven based, you simply build it with Maven, no need for the IDE to build.
Jul 26 12:30:15 <CustosL1men>	mistria, see - I just want a simple straight forward way to generate jars for like 20 projects like this from command line
Jul 26 12:30:37 <CustosL1men>	normally I use maven as base - but people who made these projects did not
Jul 26 12:30:53 <CustosL1men>	and I'm trying to figure out how to get this to build automatically for me to jars
Jul 26 12:33:18 <mistria>	CustosL1men: the best way is to migrate this project to Maven. You can automate Eclipse export with Ant, but it's a PITA to maintain such approach
Jul 26 12:34:58 <CustosL1men>	ok - let me see about adding pom.xml files
Jul 26 12:35:29 <CustosL1men>	thanks for help mistria - really means allot ;)
Jul 26 12:35:45 <CustosL1men>	I normally just use vim + maven
Jul 26 12:35:58 <CustosL1men>	so I'm a bit overwhelmed by this IDE stuff
Jul 26 12:46:27 <mistria>	CustosL1men: there's for sure a learning curve, but it's wrth iy
Jul 26 12:46:36 <mistria>	worth it
Jul 26 12:46:58 <dan>	Hi, I just wanted to know, howcome Eclipse does not support JavaFX by default? Is JavaFX considered "dead"?
Jul 26 12:47:00 <CustosL1men>	mistria, for me not really - vim > - but anyway - main challenge is to just get this stuff auto building from command line
Jul 26 12:49:23 <mistria>	CustosL1men: vim is for sure an awesome editor. But automated build, awesome completion, debug, instant error reporting... Even if typimg cam be slower, all the other tools make coding good things easier
Jul 26 12:49:49 <CustosL1men>	mistria, but IMO automated build just inside maven is not usefull
Jul 26 12:50:06 <CustosL1men>	instant error reporting is nice, and auto completion is nice - but not that nice that I ever miss it
Jul 26 12:50:18 <CustosL1men>	<CustosL1men> mistria, but IMO automated build just inside maven is not usefull < I mean just inside eclipse
Jul 26 12:50:39 <CustosL1men>	like I said normally I juse maven - and then for people who want to use eclipse its no problem - but other way round is serious issue IMO
Jul 26 12:50:57 <CustosL1men>	if I cant build something easily from command line its a failure
Jul 26 12:52:29 <mistria>	CustomL1men: I agree about build shouldn't require IDE
Jul 26 12:53:06 <mistria>	CustomL1men: however, the last versions of Maven support in Eclipse IDE sometimes have pretty good completion. Infering parameters and documentation.
Jul 26 13:48:06 <BadApe_>	hello, i see neon has gulp support
Jul 26 13:48:22 <BadApe_>	do i need to install something?
Jul 26 15:03:04 <cjoseph>	hi, I'm using eclipse mars on an HTML page and I see a little warning triangle in the editor next to an iframe tag...but there are no error/problems listed in the problem window
Jul 26 15:03:20 <cjoseph>	any ideas why this is happening?
Jul 26 15:46:08 <nitind>	cjoseph: Have you not yet saved it to disk and let the project build (assuming the validation builder is set on that project)?
Jul 26 15:47:09 <cjoseph>	@nitind: is saved to disk...I have never run build, as it's just static HTML
Jul 26 16:03:47 <nitind>	cjoseph: You can righ-click on the file and Validate from there...I think.
Jul 26 16:04:04 <nitind>	Otherwise it's not going to add anything to the Problems View.
Jul 26 16:08:54 <cjoseph>	oh, that did it
Jul 26 16:08:57 <cjoseph>	thanks

Jul 27 16:13:07 <Vauff>	hi, i'm having an issue with eclipse where the code detail hover window is black and cannot be read, this started happening on a new neon install on linux with an imported workspace from windows mars https://i.imgur.com/bcwHwWS.png
Jul 27 16:15:27 <jeen>	Vauff, that's a known problem with Eclipse on Linux, I've seen it happen as far back as Helios. Fix is to install gnome-color-chooser and there configure background/foreground colors for tooltips.
Jul 27 16:16:03 <jeen>	see http://askubuntu.com/questions/45001/how-to-fix-black-tooltips-in-eclipse
Jul 27 16:18:03 <Vauff>	do you know if that would work with cinnamon?
Jul 27 17:26:37 <Vauff>	jeen: i've got it up and running now, however it seems that eclipse doesn't listen to anything i do with the background colour, the foreground does change properly though
Jul 27 18:39:35 <chealer>	hi. When debugging, when a variable is selected in the Variables view and its value changes, it does not highlight in yellow (since it's highlighted as selected). is this a known issue?
Jul 27 22:38:15 <_44trent>	so i have some code, but it's all commented out by line...how do I uncomment them all
Jul 27 22:38:36 <_44trent>	i'm trying to use find and replace to get rid of it, btw
Jul 27 22:39:57 <_44trent>	i got rid of the comments that didn't have the line number in them but for example on line 233...it's like this at the start "/* 233 */"
Jul 27 22:40:11 <_44trent>	is there a way i could make it remove everything starting with /* and ending with /*?
Jul 27 22:45:17 <_44trent>	uhm, is anyone here?
Jul 27 22:49:07 <_44trent>	*tumbleweed*
Jul 27 22:55:33 <_44trent>	just highlighting the lines and doing control + shift + \ keeps the whitespaces and the numbers
Jul 27 22:56:23 <phroa>	the comments start and end on the same line, always?
Jul 27 23:04:19 <_44trent>	yeah
Jul 27 23:04:46 <phroa>	they are the only thing on a given line?
Jul 27 23:04:59 <_44trent>	well each line has the comment, and then the code

Jul 27 23:06:49 <phroa>	have you thought about telling jd-gui to not generate those
Jul 27 23:06:59 <_44trent>	uhm, no.
Jul 27 23:07:05 <_44trent>	that's a thing?
Jul 27 23:07:23 <phroa>	that's such an intrusive feature I have to assume you can turn it off
Jul 27 23:08:06 <_44trent>	yeah someone else had already messed with a little, they have a server that is still running alpha and he had to make a new authentication server...
Jul 27 23:08:19 <_44trent>	and they disabled the part that makes it download the game
Jul 27 23:11:05 <_44trent>	i mean, I could get the uncommented code from the unmodified launcher actually
Jul 27 23:11:09 *	_44trent facepalms
Jul 27 23:12:51 <_44trent>	yep the code is untouched except for those things, I did a diff check first
Jul 27 23:13:01 <_44trent>	should be able to just copy it back in
Jul 27 23:19:30 <_44trent>	weird, those comment things are happening with everything...
Jul 27 23:19:36 <_44trent>	is eclipse doing something?
Jul 28 00:46:33 <khlorghaal>	cdt doesnt appear to be passing any of my -l args http://hastebin.com/zawelinijo.tex i know the project settings are correct, but its not showing -lSDL2 anywhere in the output
Jul 28 00:49:56 <khlorghaal>	even if i manually put it in linker misc args it doesnt show up
Jul 28 05:50:09 <StephenS>	hey is it possible to have Insert Dependency in pom.xml when I do alt+space?
Jul 28 07:31:44 <rann>	Hi all, running Eclipse Neon since three days. Have an annoying bug that appears when trying to alter workingsets in Enterprise Explorer and/or Project Explorer. I get an error dialog that tells me that a certain icon in an obj16/ directory could not be found.
Jul 28 07:32:59 <rann>	This seems innocent enough, but two times already, after this error and after closing the IDE, Enterprise Explorer crashed due to workingsets.xml being in an invalid state (two workingsets with the same name it says and creates a modern art of ui elements in Enterprise Explorer)
Jul 28 08:03:34 <pandaadb>	Hi - I have set up a gradle project for scala. It builds fine and i can import it into eclipse, however every time I change anything the editor tells me evertthing is broken
Jul 28 08:56:36 <chealer>	my issue is already tracked in ticket #246733.
Jul 28 08:58:42 <chealer>	if someone has the necessary privilege, this should not be assigned to CDT.
Jul 28 11:52:21 <nitind>	rann: You should report which icon cant be found through ~bugzilla
Jul 28 11:52:21 <Arbalest>	Bugzilla is the bug tracking system used by Eclipse. Open new bug reports and/or enhancement requests https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi / Search for existing bugs and/or enhancement requests https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/query.cgi
Jul 28 11:56:12 <rann>	nitind: alrighty, will do
Jul 28 11:58:34 <rann>	nitind: This one is getting the same backtrace (new, unconfirmed: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=488618)
Jul 28 11:59:38 <rann>	And this one: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=465456
Jul 28 12:03:11 <rann>	heh, how appropriate: "This is a timebomb that shouldn't be left ticking without a target milestone."
Jul 28 15:33:41 <_44trent>	so i'm trying to modify an older minecraft launcher but I can't seem to start it with any run configuration
Jul 28 15:34:12 <_44trent>	iirc the main class is LauncherFrame...in net.minecraft.LauncherFrame...
Jul 28 15:34:20 <_44trent>	but it still won't start
Jul 28 15:35:47 <_44trent>	does anyone know how the heck I can launch it?
Jul 28 15:36:01 <nitind>	WHat have you already tried?
Jul 28 15:36:32 <_44trent>	well, I opened the run configurations and made a run configuration with it's main method being "net.minecraft.LauncherFrame"
Jul 28 15:36:34 <_44trent>	but it can't find that
Jul 28 15:36:55 <_44trent>	i try to do it from the parent directory as the launcher also needs LZMA stuff...
Jul 28 15:37:40 <_44trent>	manifest.mf in meta-inf does say the main class is "net.minecraft.LauncherFrame"
Jul 28 15:38:08 <_44trent>	http://hastebin.com/poyunarero.pas
Jul 28 15:38:12 <_44trent>	that's the manifest
Jul 28 15:38:30 <_44trent>	i don't see why it won't run at all, it doesn't find any methods at all, only the system ones
Jul 28 15:39:32 <_44trent>	do i need to set launcherframe.java as my main class or something?
Jul 28 15:40:03 <_44trent>	this is the directory structure of my project btw: https://vgy.me/s2WMTH
Jul 28 15:43:06 <_44trent>	i should have set that as my source folder probably

Jul 29 03:36:04 <Stummi>	Is there some way to hide warnings from generated source files?
Jul 29 05:41:15 <rann>	Stummi: Apparently this is a feature in the JDT plugin (so .java only) since 3.8: Project properties > Java Build Path > Compiler > Source, "Selectively ignore errors/warnings from source folders". The toggle is called "Ignore optional compile problems" and can be enabled on per-folder basis

Jul 30 12:10:26 <red-lichtie>	Hi, I've just installed the latest version of eclipse (neon) using the online installer. Now when I try to add another site I am getting the following error "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class sun.security.ssl.SSLSessionImpl"
Jul 30 12:11:48 <red-lichtie>	But the error is coming from within that class. Any ideas?
Jul 30 12:17:10 <red-lichtie>	I looks like it might be a nJVM problem
Jul 30 12:47:39 <red-lichtie>	I get the error using openjdk 8 but not with oracle, so using the "-vm" to force that one
Jul 30 17:02:58 <TheChubu>	hi! i have a question
Jul 30 17:03:12 <TheChubu>	does anybody knows where on earth i can get Eclipse launcher's icons?
Jul 30 17:03:35 <TheChubu>	afaik they do like some icons with a tiny "JEE" or "PHP" or whatever for each of the distributions
Jul 30 17:03:42 <TheChubu>	dunno where to find htem
Jul 30 22:27:01 <ecfuser71476>	Hello!
Jul 31 06:05:16 <eagles0513875_>	hey guys anyone here
Jul 31 06:07:03 <eagles0513875_>	i need some major help with exporting to a runnable jar file but for some reason im running it on the command line for testing purposes
Jul 31 06:07:18 <eagles0513875_>	and its like the jar file is not finding the java file with the class that has the main method
Jul 31 06:07:28 <eagles0513875_>	i check with java tvc on the jar file and i see the app.java file there
Jul 31 06:07:30 <eagles0513875_>	any ideas
Jul 31 06:07:56 <eagles0513875_>	running the main class from with in eclipse works fine no problem just jar file
Jul 31 09:00:56 <surial>	eagles0513875_: what exactly are you running? java -cp myjar.jar or java -jar myjar.jar? Also, separately, you should really be making these with maven, gradle, or ant, not eclipse.
Jul 31 10:11:30 <eagles0513875_>	surial: they are ant scripts im using eclipse and telling it to export everything to a runnable jar file
Jul 31 10:12:01 <eagles0513875_>	surial: thing is this was a single developer FOSS project and lead dev is stepping back. and im taking over so i am with out documentation on how things are if you like i can provide you a link to the repository.
Jul 31 10:15:38 <eagles0513875_>	surial: another issue is that this is 25 seperate projects and instead of creating an installer for each I want something which is a bit more portable
Jul 31 10:15:49 <eagles0513875_>	hence my wanting to use a runnable jar
Jul 31 11:07:16 <surial>	eagles0513875_: you should make this monolithic runnable jar with maven, gradle, or ant, and not eclipse.
Jul 31 11:07:31 <eagles0513875_>	how does one do that with ant
Jul 31 11:07:49 <eagles0513875_>	if ant scripts are spread across 25 different projects in eclipse
Jul 31 14:23:45 <Tase>	Installed jdk 1.8 x86, run eclisep-insta-win32.exe, does nothing
Jul 31 14:24:06 <Tase>	run eclipse-inst-win64.exe, shows missing 64bit jfk (as expected)
Jul 31 14:24:35 <Tase>	i went to the wiki for install instructions, but it forwards to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php?show_instructions=TRUE
Jul 31 14:24:39 <Tase>	which shows nothing
Jul 31 17:14:37 <flappynerd>	for the CDT (C++ Developer Tools) do I need the "C++ Developer Tools SDK" or is that only if I want to contribute to CDT itself?
Jul 31 19:42:56 <AlpTunga_>	Hello all
Jul 31 19:45:54 <AlpTunga_>	I had a problem about Eclipse Console doesn't get EOF (ctrl+d) as input and it was solved by updating it. It was eclipse-cpp-mars-R-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz. Something broke down and i was not able to launch it so i installed a new one from Ubuntu Software Center. Even though i updated it i still got the same problem.
Jul 31 20:05:59 <AlpTunga_>	Upgrading from previous Eclipse IDE package to Neon (4.6) is NOT supported https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_upgrade_Eclipse_IDE%3F
Jul 31 20:06:00 <AlpTunga_>	nvm.
Jul 31 20:09:56 <donald1>	I have just installed eclipse IDE with this tuto https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-java/installer-les-outils-de-developpement. I follow these instructions to setup a new project but at the selection of installed JRE after Window > Preferences I still do not see the bar situated under the name "package explorer". How to see this one to read my code on the right side and begin to code?
Jul 31 20:26:21 <davidmichaelkarr>	donald1: Sorry, but you'll have to be much more specific.  I have no idea what "do not see the bar" means. Also note that most people here will be english-speaking (and mostly not french-reading), so don't expect us to get much information from pages like that.
Jul 31 20:43:31 <donald1>	I have just installed eclipse IDE with this tuto https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-java/installer-les-outils-de-developpement. I follow these instructions to setup a new project but I can not create the left bar.
Jul 31 20:56:14 <upgrdman>	how do i attached a javadoc JAR for eclipse to see? im trying to use the Apache Commons Math library. i did the Add External JARs thing, and added the commons...jar and commons...javadoc.jar files. both are listed under Referenced Libraries. but Eclipse can't seem to see the javadoc when i hover over a method to try and see it's javadoc.
Aug 01 08:47:37 <carabia>	Question of Eclipse C/C++, when you write a function prototype, and later you define said function , is it possible for eclipse to auto-complete the parameters?
Aug 01 08:48:26 <carabia>	The way, e.g. visual studio does it, iirc
Aug 01 10:46:13 <RajRajRaj>	hi i am setting up eclipse cdt for existing code, that code required some environment variables to be set upfront in order to build it. how do i do it in eclipse build configuration.
Aug 01 14:46:38 <carabia>	I'll ask again, if anyone knows ~
Aug 01 14:46:43 <carabia>	Question of Eclipse C/C++, when you write a function prototype, and later you define said function , is it possible for eclipse to auto-complete the parameters?
Aug 01 15:41:01 <nitind>	So have you tried it, or having tried it, found it not to do that?
Aug 01 15:43:44 <themiddleman_>	Quick question, how can I access the project properties from a plugin
Aug 01 15:47:40 <nitind>	What do you mean?
Aug 01 15:48:55 <nitind>	themiddleman_: https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-core/documents/user_settings/faq.html#platformScopes and  http://help.eclipse.org/neon/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/ProjectScope.html ?
Aug 01 16:04:45 <davidmichaelkarr>	So I just tried to set up Tomcat 8.5.3 (in TomEE 7.0.1) in Eclipse, and apparently there is a long-standing required hack to the "ServerInfo.properties" file to fool Eclipse to knowing it's Tomcat 8.x. Seems strange this is still required.
Aug 01 16:09:05 <nitind>	Are you sure this doesn't fall under ~494936 ?
Aug 01 16:09:06 <Arbalest>	Bug 494936 - http://bugs.eclipse.org/494936 - WTP ServerTools / jst.server / 3.7 - All / All - NEW /  / normal / - Assignee: Larry.Isaacs - Add Tomcat 8.5 support to WTP Server Tools
Aug 01 16:11:35 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: Thanks.  Looks like that's it.  Not as long-standing as I thought.
Aug 01 16:12:30 <themiddleman_>	@nitind sry for the delay, I'm referring to project propeties, like when a project is right-clicked ->properties, is there a way I can get those same details through an eclipse plugin?
Aug 01 16:13:32 <nitind>	themiddleman_: So you don't mean accessing them, you mean opening the same dialog?
Aug 01 16:13:47 <themiddleman_>	yeah accessing them would be fine
Aug 01 16:15:18 <themiddleman_>	not really opening with a dialog
Aug 01 16:18:11 <nitind>	themiddleman_: Take a look at the two URLs I posted earlier (in the voice of Ida).
Aug 01 16:24:41 <davidmichaelkarr>	If I've created a Dynamic Web Project with the usual defaults, but I want to move step by step to a Maven organization, how do I properly move "WebContent" to "src/main/webapp"?
Aug 01 16:25:55 <themiddleman_>	@nitind so for example if a project also has git associated with it, when accessing the project properties I can see that it has git url associate with it, is there a way I can access that git URL?
Aug 01 16:29:50 <davidmichaelkarr>	Never mind.  Figured it out.
Aug 01 16:29:54 <nitind>	themiddleman_: I can only throw you at the jgit API, http://download.eclipse.org/jgit/site/4.4.1.201607150455-r/apidocs/index.html . The project isn't usually the git root itself.
Aug 01 16:32:24 <themiddleman_>	@nitind , ahhh ok
Aug 01 17:21:57 <themiddleman_>	hmmm, another dead end...
Aug 01 17:22:36 <themiddleman_>	is there a way to get the remote repository url of a project through a plugin?
Aug 01 17:25:21 <nitind>	Have you looked at how the GitProjectPropertyPage figures it out?
Aug 01 17:28:24 <themiddleman_>	@nitind , I have not, looking at it right now
Aug 01 18:27:36 <themiddleman_>	ok phew! Finally got it
Aug 01 19:45:52 <carabia>	nitind, I have not found a way to do it, if you asked me earlier.
Aug 01 19:46:34 <carabia>	I just figured, at least myself I found it kind of a crucial feature
Aug 01 19:47:02 <carabia>	Maybe not crucial, but a really really amazing quality of life -type of thing.
Aug 01 19:52:59 <themiddleman_>	so in order to get the git remote url for a project, I first get all the projects (IProject). 2. Iterating through all the projects I get the GITProvider through RepositoryProvider.getProvider. 3. get the repositoryMappings.entrySet, and iterate through the entrySet. 4.Get the repository from the RepositoryMapping, then follow http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2011/08/16/jgit-api-reading-configuration-information/

Aug 02 13:25:27 <davidmichaelkarr>	When running a REST service app in Tomcat in Eclipse, is there any way to prevent it from creating an editor view attempting to access the root url of the project?
Aug 02 13:37:39 <cores>	i have a really simple question, i want to open an existing c++ in place (it's in a source controlled directory), i don't want to "import" it. how can I do that?
Aug 02 13:38:05 <cores>	an existing c++ project in place, i mean
Aug 02 13:43:00 <cores>	i hope this "import existing projects into workspace" did the trick
Aug 02 13:43:50 <cores>	this "eclipse way" of doing things is confusing to a newcomer fresh off a vim,make,git workflow
Aug 02 13:44:36 <cores>	projects, workspaces, impoting, perspectives... what is going on..?

Aug 02 20:34:18 <donald1>	Ican create a new project but I can not edit it or open it on eclipse
Aug 02 21:40:44 <brandan>	what the directory where eclipse stores all it's settings in linux?
Aug 02 21:41:25 <brandan>	hmm
Aug 02 21:41:29 <brandan>	nvm
Aug 02 22:04:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: I figured it out.  It's a little weird, but even though Eclipse refers to the same Tomcat distro, it doesn't use the same server configs as the distro is using. I had to import the modified file into the server definition (which also strangely confused the server itself, because it wouldn't let me save the file until I stopped the server, but Eclipse
Aug 02 22:04:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	thought the server was already stopped. Restarting Eclipse fixed that.), then I could make additional changes to the imported files.
Aug 03 03:24:13 <Mazi>	Hi eclipse experts, can someone help with a question about Egit?
Aug 03 03:25:23 <Mazi>	At my local Git project I have edited some files and also added a new folder/library with ~500 files. How can I commit the new folder only? When using Team -> commit I get the list of all changed files but I want to commit the single folder + its files only.
Aug 03 03:25:24 <Arbalest>	Bug 500 does not exist.
Aug 03 03:39:11 <Stummi>	Mazi, git does not know anything about directories
Aug 03 03:39:21 <Stummi>	thats why you can't commit empty directories into a git repo
Aug 03 03:40:05 <Mazi>	Stummi, it is not empty. I just wonder if there is any easy way to commit a single directory only without other files which were also edited.
Aug 03 03:42:34 <Stummi>	ah, right, sorry. Misread your message
Aug 03 03:43:16 <Stummi>	not sure, I normally do stuff like this from the command line
Aug 03 04:09:16 <khlorghaal>	does CDT not support c++ 11? im getting erroneous errors and stackoverflow fixes arent working
Aug 03 04:09:40 <khlorghaal>	im using neon now, i was using indigo in the past and everything was fine
Aug 03 05:19:07 <khlorghaal>	started a new project and everything, bah ill just redownload indigo, its not like neon is a perceptible improvement
Aug 03 05:23:03 <khlorghaal>	there seems to be hundreds of people having issues like this and no fixes
Aug 03 07:15:11 <cores>	nitind: say you have a bunch of directories with make files and .cproject and .project files. how do i open them in eclipse so that i'm editing the files themselves, not just copies of the files?
Aug 03 07:15:23 <cores>	if that question even makes sense, obviously i'm a little confused
Aug 03 07:24:16 <jrtappers>	Is there a way to build an update site without launching a GUI instance of eclipse?
Aug 03 07:26:20 <jrtappers>	https://wiki.eclipse.org/PDE/User_Guide doesn't seem to have a section for update sites
Aug 03 09:06:41 <cores>	i feel like customizing eclipse is a full time job

Aug 03 12:52:12 <Jasaka>	If, while working, I remove a TODO or FIXME but it still displays as being there, how can I fix that? Or more generally: If eclipses error, warning or normal markers lag behind, how can I reload(?) them. Sorry if I'm not clear in my question as I'm not a native speaker.
Aug 03 12:58:46 <cores>	good question
Aug 03 12:58:50 <cores>	i have the same thing
Aug 03 13:03:05 <Jasaka>	Normally, it seems (with small projects) it reloads them on saving. But after a long time of work on a bigger project it just bugs out. I have a few classes which are now fully blue-underlined.
Aug 03 13:04:36 <psuzzi>	This seems a bug. Can you take a screenshot / anim gif, and report a new bug on Platform UI ?

Aug 03 16:28:14 <nitind>	cores: Once the git clone is in the Git Repositories View, use the context menu in the working directory tree to Import Projects from there. They will not be copied.
Aug 03 16:28:44 <nitind>	Jasaka: For what kind of file?
Aug 03 18:45:01 <Saul775>	Hello.  I'm creating a JAR file that uses Microsoft's JDBC driver.  However, everytime the method is invoked, I get a ClassNotFoundException.  I've had some help from people in #java and the Internet.  I'm instructed to set the classpath.  I thought I did this, but I still get the exception.  Where do I set the classpath in Eclipse?
Aug 03 18:45:21 <Saul775>	I've tried setting it under Window --> Preferences --> Java --> Build Path --> Classpath Variables.   Is this the correct location?
Aug 03 19:00:32 <nitind>	You would add the jar itself as a jar to the Java Build Path.
Aug 03 19:05:35 <Saul775>	Thank you, nitind.  I think I did this because I can see the JAR file under my referenced libraries.  Is this correct?
Aug 03 20:20:19 <nitind>	Saul775: yes. proably. haven't done JDBC in a while.

Aug 04 04:13:22 <waits_>	Is it possible to skip all the breakpoints until a certain method is executed in the call stack? I don't want to remove them.
Aug 04 04:27:30 <Amis>	Hello! I'm on Neon RC1 and I have a really hard time configuring C++11 support. I have a Makefile project with some custom (non-makefile) builder script and no matter what I do the eclipse indexer does not recognize the C++11 containers and elements. Some configuration settings: http://imgur.com/a/QECqv I've restarted several times and rebuild the index.
Aug 04 04:27:38 <Amis>	What am I doing wrong?
Aug 04 04:29:26 <Amis>	Is there some other magical settings hidden where I have to specify the flags?
Aug 04 04:30:12 <Amis>	Note that when I open a header that contains C++11 elements (like <memory>) then eclipse tells me that the __cplusplus define is not defined and excludes the code it guards
Aug 04 04:32:20 <Amis>	Correction: it says __cplusplus is defined as '199711L'
Aug 04 04:42:52 <Amis>	Thank god it solved itself because I was about the split my desk in half. It turns out that my freshly created Makefile project was not using the global provider settings so it did not have the "-std=c++11" flag added.
Aug 04 07:35:51 <Guest47968>	How can I make EGit ignore git repositories in subdirectories on pull? I just want to pull the top-level repository and not all git repositries in subdirectories.
Aug 04 12:05:37 <jmspeex>	Anyone knows how to prevent the "build on save" feature from triggering an infinite loop of builds on my project?
Aug 04 12:06:10 <jmspeex>	It started happening after I upgraded from Mars to Neon (upgrading Fedora 22 to Fedora 24)
Aug 04 12:45:43 <nitind>	That's really up to the builders.
Aug 04 12:46:20 <nitind>	wainersm: You can Disable the other breakpoints without fully Removing them. Check the Breakpoints View.

Aug 04 14:40:10 <ipun>	Arbalest thanks, will do
Aug 04 14:47:14 <ipun>	Considering this atricle is about 7 years old, I am wondering how I can extend org.eclipse.ui.ide.markersupport'
Aug 04 14:47:41 <ipun>	's markerField. The article is here: http://blog.eclipse-tips.com/2008/11/creating-custom-marker-view.html
Aug 04 14:49:47 <nitind>	That's a question to ask only after you've tried it and found out that it doesn't work that way any more.
Aug 04 15:05:30 <ipun>	nitind, i've currently been trying it on an existing extension point, the Problems view. I'm trying to get the "projects" column to display
Aug 04 15:06:26 <nitind>	What does the Problems View have to do with it?
Aug 04 15:07:47 <ipun>	im trying to develop something on the Problems view, so i am trying to get an additional field to come up, more importantly, the projects column to start
Aug 04 15:46:04 <jrtappers>	I seem to be having an issue with classes used for preferences
Aug 04 15:46:33 <jrtappers>	I get null pointers for private static final strings that have the value set immediately
Aug 04 15:46:58 <jrtappers>	private static final FOO = "bar";
Aug 04 15:47:05 <jrtappers>	And then the value later on is null
Aug 04 15:50:47 <nitind>	Where?
Aug 04 15:50:51 <nitind>	Also in a static?
Aug 04 15:54:44 <jrtappers>	Statics and also instance methods
Aug 04 15:55:15 <jrtappers>	Mainly static methods though
Aug 04 15:59:16 <jrtappers>	It seems to be ok if I have a static method that sets the values and manually call it before getting the values [removing the final], but not if it is declared and assigned together, although this seems like a messy workaround
Aug 04 16:11:47 <jrtappers>	Similar example - http://pastebin.com/ZR5EUBkS - On line 64 vals contains 12 nulls
Aug 04 16:12:17 <jrtappers>	It is a similar issue in enums
Aug 04 16:15:27 <jrtappers>	The method [setDefaults()] is called from a method [initializeDefaultPreferences()] which is part of a class registered as a PreferenceInitializer

Aug 05 11:13:06 <davidmichaelkarr>	I'm running Tomcat (TomEE) from Eclipse, and after I renamed a project (cloned, deleted old one), now Tomcat is confused with some sort of JMX error at container startup.  Is there some cache I need to delete?
Aug 05 12:00:13 <nitind>	Gamoder_: Is there a bug report?
Aug 05 12:00:23 <nitind>	davidmichaelkarr: confused how?
Aug 05 12:01:21 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: " java.lang.ClassCastException: Cannot cast org.apache.cxf.management.jmx.InstrumentationManagerImpl to org.apache.cxf.management.InstrumentationManager".  This might be a CXF and/or TomEE problem.  I'm pursuing this on #openejb also.
Aug 05 12:01:49 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: But I didn't see this error before I "renamed" the project (cloned, then deleted old one).
Aug 05 12:01:53 <nitind>	Looks like a classloader problem. Weird.

Aug 09 12:00:07 <davidmichaelkarr>	Ah.  I just had to select the file I wanted added to ignore list.
Aug 09 12:07:57 <davidmichaelkarr>	Curious.  The "Add to svn:ignore" function is clearly bound to "Ctrl+Alt+I", but pressing that key after selecting a resource to be ignored does nothing. You still have to right-click and select the option in the submenu.

Aug 11 01:24:00 <luxigo>	Ok now we have a dark theme after ten years.... but why is it still so much a pain in the sas to darken the background more (I mean to black) and not only the editor window ?  (It's not a question, its an exasperatid sigh...)
Aug 11 01:24:26 <luxigo>	ted
Aug 11 01:24:32 <luxigo>	*SIGH*
Aug 11 04:21:41 <lilalinux>	How do you hide the "Javascript Resources" virtual folder from Project Explorer?
Aug 11 04:21:59 <lilalinux>	It can't be removed via the triangle menu
Aug 11 08:43:14 <NightStrike>	If I want an eclipse IDE that combines CDT and normal java editing, what's the best way to go about putting that together?  I could for instance have two installations (probably the worst choice), I could d/l CDT and try to install Java plugins, I could d/l the basic java ide and try ot install CDT to it, or some other option?
Aug 11 08:52:54 <NightStrike>	Using the installer seems to prefer putting each IDE in a separate directory.... eclipse/cpp-neon and eclipse/java-neon....   but that seems to indicate that I need two very separate IDEs
Aug 11 09:13:11 <lilalinux>	NightStrike: I always find it easier to start with CDT and then possible other stuff
Aug 11 09:42:08 <mpiggott>	With Neon I've started to get a bunch of 'java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xml.namespace.XMLNamespacePackage' while Auto-Saving Workspace. Restarting Eclipse entirely loses the perspective's layout and tiles all the views
Aug 11 09:43:51 <mpiggott>	Also another EMF related stack trace for Oomph 'Setup Check'
Aug 11 10:01:51 <Kakemo>	Hi, I'm coding in C++ with Eclipse and I'm having trouble installing GMP and linking it with Eclipse. Can someone help me ?
Aug 11 10:46:15 <freeone3000>	Hi. On a fresh install of Eclipse Neon, attempting to start it gives me "Eclipse could not start the Virtual Machine. Eclipse will now exit." However, I don't have an error log in the application directory - where should I look for the eclipse logs for this issue?
Aug 11 10:47:30 <freeone3000>	I haven't chosen a workspace yet, so it's not there either.
Aug 11 10:48:07 <mpiggott>	freeone3000, possibly the working directory or ~/.eclipse maybe?
Aug 11 10:49:47 <freeone3000>	mpiggott: No, no logs - it does have infos.txt which lists the JVMs and which one it chose, though, and it's a valid JVM.
Aug 11 10:50:57 <mpiggott>	freeone3000, there is also the cli option -consoleLog https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_Where_can_I_find_that_elusive_.log_file%3F
Aug 11 10:52:45 <freeone3000>	Ah. "Java started but returned exit code 1". And then immediately exits. That's... better, I guess.
Aug 11 11:16:56 <nitind>	freeone3000: "it's a valid JVM" --which one was it?
Aug 11 13:26:52 <freeone3000>	nitind: Oracle 1.8.0 64-bit.
Aug 11 13:31:15 <nitind>	freeone3000: More specific than that?
Aug 11 13:31:53 <freeone3000>	nitind: "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0;1;8;0;64;true;1395170345840"?
Aug 11 13:33:17 <nitind>	freeone3000: I really meant is it the newest 1.8.0, and I trust this is a 64-bit Neon download?
Aug 11 13:35:13 <freeone3000>	nitind: Launcher library is "C:\Users\temp\.p2\pool\plugins\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_64_1.1.400.v20160518-1444". And the JDK is b132, so not *newest* but not terribly old.
Aug 11 13:36:36 <nitind>	From the Command Prompt, are you able to run that installed copy of java.exe?
Aug 11 13:37:33 <freeone3000>	nitind: Yes.
Aug 11 13:37:47 <nitind>	How'd you install Neon?
Aug 11 13:38:14 <freeone3000>	nitind: There was a x64 installer on eclipse.org, co-branded "oomph". I downloaded and ran that.
Aug 11 13:41:39 <nitind>	Have you edited the eclipse.ini file manually?
Aug 11 13:41:48 <freeone3000>	No, this is a fresh install.
Aug 11 14:04:03 <nitind>	Where did it get installed?
Aug 11 14:05:39 <freeone3000>	nitind: C:\Users\temp\eclipse
Aug 11 14:05:47 <freeone3000>	nitind: %HOME% is C:\Users\temp
Aug 11 14:07:30 <nitind>	This launcher library detail, did a dialog pop open with the -1 and bunch of other stuff
Aug 11 14:07:34 <nitind>	?
Aug 11 14:07:57 <freeone3000>	nitind: Yeah, it gave me the error code 1 and the list of launch options.
Aug 11 14:08:12 <nitind>	Can you post the ~image ?

Aug 11 14:38:44 <themiddleman>	hello all
Aug 11 14:41:01 <freeone3000>	nitind: https://imgur.com/a/XVsnP
Aug 11 14:44:08 <nitind>	freeone3000: Can you try editing the c:\Users\temp\eclipse\cpp-neon\eclipse\eclipse.ini file and removing the lines that start with -XX: ?
Aug 11 14:46:59 <freeone3000>	nitind: Alright, that gets me to the splash screen. Thanks.
Aug 11 14:47:19 <themiddleman>	somewhat quick question, my computer had restarted abruptly and it seems as if eclipse doesn't seem to recognize any plugin dependencies I have for my plugin project
Aug 11 14:47:42 <nitind>	dependencies that are in the workspace?
Aug 11 14:49:50 <themiddleman>	err they are for a plugin project
Aug 11 14:50:02 <nitind>	still applies
Aug 11 14:50:27 <themiddleman>	they are more like dependencies that should be with eclipse like org.eclipse.jface
Aug 11 14:50:37 <themiddleman>	or org.eclipse.ui
Aug 11 14:50:59 <nitind>	Information about where those are on-disk might have gone squirrely. From the preference page (Preferences > Plug-in Development > Target Platform), try Removing the Running Platform target definition, Applying, and then Restoring Defaults.
Aug 11 14:51:17 <nitind>	Or, at the last, putting them back the way you'd put them before.
Aug 11 14:52:37 <themiddleman>	ahhh ok thanks that did the trick
Aug 11 14:53:05 <freeone3000>	nitind: Yep, everything's working now! Weird that the -XX were specified by default when they didn't work, thanks.
Aug 12 12:31:42 <Restioson>	Hi. How can I prevent eGit from creating a folder inside of my repo and putting my stuff there instead of at it's root?
Aug 12 14:39:45 <chealer>	hi. when I open a function documentation page from PHP's manual via Content assist proposals, it strangely opens in a small tooltip-like zone in Eclipse rather than in my browser. Is this a known issue and if not, can it open in my browser?
Aug 12 14:41:51 <chealer>	Version 4.6.0 on Windows, with Eclipse set to use Firefox.
Aug 12 16:20:14 <chealer>	I reported in ticket #499629
Aug 13 02:59:19 <upgrdman>	are there any plugins for profiling java program per line (not just per-function time, but "hot spots" with line granularity) ?
Aug 13 11:44:45 <donald>	how to display old projects to the package explorer of eclipse?
Aug 14 02:31:06 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Pardon.. I'm quietly lusing my mind.  When creating an SWT button, there is an autocomplete for adding a selection listener.
Aug 14 02:32:09 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Button b1 = new Button(shell, SWT.PUSH);  b1.addSelectionListener(new SelectionAdapter()   and there is something here that causes Eclipse to offer to add missing methods.

Aug 15 15:45:23 <nitind>	You are impatient, but the answer would have been "yes."
Aug 15 17:15:58 <huck5>	Is there a way in Eclipse, maybe with a plugin, to see/track Java web-application HTTP Requests/Request forwarding?
Aug 15 17:19:22 <nitind>	whose requests? what forwarding?
Aug 15 17:26:24 <huck5>	The project I'm in does a lot of request redirects, which I don't see in my Web Console. Just wondering if there's an easy way to track that from within Eclipse
Aug 15 17:26:39 <huck5>	So say HTML5Controller gets a request... it then just forwards that whole request to another Servlet.
Aug 15 19:53:49 <Bento324>	When I try to create a JUnit Test Case, every time I specify a Class under test, it tells me the Class under test does not exist in current project. It clearly does, because I can browse and find it, and if I manually write the test it works. It won't let me Finish unless I clear out the Class under test. Has anyone else run into this?
Aug 16 04:14:02 <tusharm>	is anyone here experienced with swtbot (test cases for eclipse plugins)? I need some help
Aug 16 04:14:54 <tusharm>	The editors that I have extended from TextEditor are unable to pick up their resource bundles while testing with swtbot but this works when trying it out manually
Aug 16 04:15:07 <tusharm>	even a link to something useful would greatly help
Aug 16 05:02:59 <yin_yang2k>	Is git.eclipse.org down? I can't use the Oomph installer.

Aug 16 14:38:53 <afx_>	Hello ! I am using debian 8 x64 and want to install eclipse-neon . Should I run the installer as root ? also thinking to install it under /opt folder .Is that safe?
Aug 16 14:50:54 <nitind>	It can unnecessarily complicate things, but it should be safe to install (and then *not* run) as root.
Aug 16 14:53:16 <afx_>	nitind, ok currently I get : Artifact download is progressing very slowly from the following hosts . Can be my inet connection , don't know
Aug 16 14:56:32 <afx_>	nitind, can I install it in home dir and then move it to /opt?
Aug 16 14:58:05 <nitind>	yeah, but why?

Aug 17 12:48:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	Zemeio: Opening a file does not require closing anything. Not sure what you mean.
Aug 17 12:49:49 <Zemeio>	When I use open type, it searches on every open project, wanted to know if you guys know how to search only a specific project
Aug 17 13:03:31 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I've got a glitch in my thinking of how projects and packages are managed in Eclipse.
Aug 17 13:03:59 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I can create a project in Eclipse (am using Java).
Aug 17 13:04:06 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I can create a package in that project.
Aug 17 13:04:25 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I believe I can create multiple packages within that project.
Aug 17 13:05:10 <Frigid_Cryotank>	But I do not understand the nomenclature such as packages having names like "com.gs.error", "com.gs.exec", "com.gs.whatever".
Aug 17 13:05:33 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Are each of these sub-packages executables in their own right?
Aug 17 13:06:14 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Or does Eclipse view them as all being required for an executable in the top level project?  (and now I'm not sure I'm phrasing the question properly).

Aug 17 15:00:12 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: A package is just a namespace mechanism, so you can arrange classes in sensible functional groups.  A package is not "executable".
Aug 17 15:25:33 <Frigid_Cryotank>	So if I have multiple source files inside a package, and one source imports a class from another java source file in the same package (namespace) then "all should be well" ...?
Aug 17 15:26:45 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: I don't know about that, but if you reference a class in the same package as the referencing class, you don't have to import it.
Aug 17 15:27:03 <nitind>	Import just lets you use the unqualified name of a type to refer to it, either by importing that type's fully qualified name or all the contents of a package (with the .*). You don't need to import types from the same package--that's the first place the compiler will look for types you refer to anyway.
Aug 17 15:27:58 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Apologies for it being ..cryptic.  What I've been doing is working my way through a tutorial on Java.  Each section of the tutorial has multiple problems... and I was wondering if Eclipse would let me organize all these separate projects into a hierarchy of projects.
Aug 17 15:29:10 <Frigid_Cryotank>	So there would be a "Strings" "project"... and under that would be a Project for the first problem, another for the second problem..
Aug 17 15:29:37 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Which probably looks terrible as far as the filesystem goes... but it's all about organizing things anyway...
Aug 17 15:30:13 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: That's not really practical.  It is possible to use "tasks", or "Mylyn", so that when you're working on the "strings" task, you can limit what you see to projects related to that.
Aug 17 15:30:46 <nitind>	Unless you're going to have projects that aren't for these problems, they're already in a group of sorts by being in a single workspace.
Aug 17 15:37:28 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Re: Mylyn: I'm still plodding my way through simple Java material.  But I think I see the point.  So... having separate projects for all these little problems is the way to go (for the moment).
Aug 17 15:40:07 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I was having a Terrible time with Neon under Slackware Linux.  The default GTK interface has far too much whitespace with the buttons, borders, just everything.  Setting Preferences --> General --> Appearance to "Classic" just didn't work... then found an old post saying "export SWT_GTK3=0"  .. and, oh my, that made Neon extremely responsive.

Aug 18 16:25:19 <defanco>	hello
Aug 18 16:25:20 <Arbalest>	Welcome! If you have a question, just ask, or take a look at our FAQ - http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ :) Try typing ~faq to see more FAQs!

Aug 18 16:29:42 <defanco>	Ran into a bit of an issue with Eclipse that I think could've been avoided. I have a plugin that has Scala nature, other developer checked out this plugin and tries to run it in product, but gets ClassNotFoundException on one of the classes in the plugin. Of course we forget that this plugin has Scala nature and thus expects Scala Builder that we don't have because we don't have Scala IDE installed. The question is why didn't Eclips
Aug 18 16:29:42 <defanco>	e throw some kind of error into Console informing of this fact?
Aug 18 16:31:13 <defanco>	I think these kind of errors are common but hard to diagnose because NoClassFoundException can mean many things being wrong with the plugin
Aug 18 16:36:26 <defanco>	And I think in this particular situation solution is even more simpler since if UI is smart enough to mark Builder as missing, it could go extra step and log warning in the console...
Aug 18 19:14:50 <zave_>	hello, does anyone know what to do about this error "The BPMN Diagram element is not enabled in this Tool Profile"? i think it's the reason why when i drag events into the diagram, they won't stick. am i on the right track?
Aug 19 03:15:54 <jablo>	Swithced to a high-resolution (4K) display. Oh my, now Eclipse is almost unusable due to slooooow scrolling.
Aug 19 03:17:33 <jablo>	I switched from Netbeans to Eclipse for that reason. Now I fear I'll have to switch to Qtcreator (we're a C++/Qt shop).
Aug 19 03:24:20 <mvvvv>	jablo, what is your GPU ?
Aug 19 03:28:47 <jablo>	It's a Dell M3800. GPU is Nvidia Quadro K1100M GPU as far as I know
Aug 19 03:28:52 <jablo>	Linux, Ubuntu 14.04
Aug 19 03:30:28 <jablo>	Oh - I'm using X.Org X server -- Nouveau display driver. Maybe I should try the NVIDIA binary driver.
Aug 19 03:42:31 <jablo>	No. Even using NVIDIA binary driver, mouse-wheel scrolling is horribly slow. Eclipse can't keep up and is lagging 10s of seconds behind.
Aug 19 03:43:01 <jablo>	(sigh. I hate QtCreator and only use it when I absolutely have to in some debug sessions)
Aug 19 03:44:46 <mvvvv>	jablo, do you know what is your kernel version ?
Aug 19 03:45:14 <jablo>	Linux jl 3.16.0-77-generic #99~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jun 28 19:17:10 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Aug 19 03:45:18 <lookshe>	how can i skip the unnecessary local repository when cloning a git repository from eclipse?
Aug 19 03:46:52 <mvvvv>	jablo, I know that kernel 4.4 (ubuntu 16.04) has  dramatically enhanced the free video drivers
Aug 19 03:48:30 <jablo>	Oh. Interesting. Maybe that's a reason for upgrading (ie. re-installing), I was thinking of waiting for the .1 release and do an in-place upgrade instead. Hmm,.
Aug 19 03:49:20 <jablo>	QtCreator in comparison is lightning fast. Netbeans was horribly slow even on normal HD resolution. Eclipse is nice and fast on HD resolution, but can't keep up on 4K
Aug 19 03:49:22 <mvvvv>	jablo, on the other hand I've seen many problems with nvidia drivers on 16.04
Aug 19 03:49:34 <jablo>	Oh, the joy of upgrading :)(
Aug 19 03:50:41 <mvvvv>	jablo, To evaluate my driver I test some webgl experiments (looking for the highter FPS)
Aug 19 03:59:26 <jablo>	Well, glxgears full screen 4K gives 196 fps
Aug 19 04:00:57 <jablo>	With 97% idle cpu... I guess all work is done on the GPU :)
Aug 19 04:01:56 <mvvvv>	sounds good yes
Aug 19 04:04:23 <mvvvv>	jablo, did you tried SWT_GTK3=0 before launching eclipse ?
Aug 19 04:11:52 <jablo>	wvvvv set SWT_GTK3=0  as an environment variable before starting eclipse?
Aug 19 04:12:14 <mvvvv>	Yes to use GTK2 libs instead of GTK3
Aug 19 04:12:31 <mvvvv>	this workaround can save performance
Aug 19 04:12:48 <jablo>	wvvvv, now wow, THAT really helps!
Aug 19 04:13:53 <mvvvv>	ok so because of old ubuntu 14.04 you have this old problem. Ubuntu 16.04 + eclipse neon have fix this
Aug 19 04:19:38 <jablo>	wvvvv, thanks a lot. (now wondering if this or a similar solution is possible for Netbeans)
Aug 19 04:20:48 <mvvvv>	jablo, don't think cause Netbeans do not use GTK
Aug 19 04:25:30 <jablo>	I really need to clean up my workflow. I love Eclipse for editing C++ files, and need to use QtCreator for debugging when there's a need to inspect and evaluate Qt data structures, but I use Netbeans for resolving git merge/rebase conflicts.
Aug 19 04:25:43 <jablo>	what a mess
Aug 19 04:26:23 <mvvvv>	egit on eclipse is nice
Aug 19 04:28:58 <jablo>	Hmm. I rarely dare use guis for git commands. Most git commands I use the command line - then for conflict resolution I like Netbeans graphical representation. I'm a strange person, I guess.
Aug 19 04:37:01 <jablo>	Thanks anyway for speeding up my Eclipse! You've really made my day, wvvvv
Aug 19 08:39:49 <dimm>	hello, community!
Aug 19 08:40:19 <dimm>	can't run eclipse with '-xms2048M -xmx2048M'
Aug 19 08:40:28 <dimm>	only with 1024M working
Aug 19 08:41:01 <dimm>	is this possible to run eclipse more than 1024M '-vm'?
Aug 19 09:04:56 <dimm>	solved
Aug 19 09:05:09 <dimm>	it was trouble with free ram on pc :-)
Aug 19 09:54:32 <dimm>	not solved
Aug 19 09:54:43 <dimm>	is somebody have the same error?
Aug 19 09:55:45 <Stummi>	dimm, are you on 32 bit?
Aug 19 09:56:11 <Stummi>	-Xms500m -Xmx4g in eclipse.ini works fine for me
Aug 19 09:58:25 <dimm>	not 32 bit, "mixed mode" as far as i understand it is 64bit
Aug 19 10:00:36 <Stummi>	dimm, which OS?
Aug 19 10:00:46 <dimm>	windows 7
Aug 19 10:01:06 <dimm>	omg, it seems like if it 64bit, then must say about it... it seems like i on 32bit
Aug 19 10:01:42 <Stummi>	dimm, what does "java -version" say?
Aug 19 10:01:49 <Stummi>	(last line)
Aug 19 10:02:37 <dimm>	ah, my project must on 32bit
Aug 19 10:03:04 <dimm>	Stummi: sorry, developer was close window... i wait for information
Aug 19 10:03:27 <dimm>	Stummi: i just say that it is 1.6.0_24
Aug 19 10:03:47 <dimm>	Stummi: and have not '64-bit' words on 'java-version'
Aug 19 10:05:48 <Stummi>	1.6.0 is pretty old
Aug 19 10:06:01 <dimm>	yeah :-)
Aug 19 10:06:13 <dimm>	we have some restrictions there
Aug 19 10:06:35 <Stummi>	the restriction to stick to software versions with security issues?
Aug 19 10:06:43 <davidmichaelkarr>	dimm: And have you determined for certain that you're on a 64-bit OS?
Aug 19 10:07:07 <davidmichaelkarr>	Were there 64-bit OSes when 1.6 was released? :)
Aug 19 10:07:22 <Stummi>	well, when java -version does not mention its 64 bit, the platform is irrelevant anyway. Its a 32 bit jvm
Aug 19 10:07:55 <Stummi>	and a 32 bit jvm cannot take more than 2gb (minus some overhead)
Aug 19 10:08:17 <davidmichaelkarr>	dimm: It's worthwhile to point out that even if you're required to use 1.6 for your application, there should be nothing wrong with using the latest JDK to run Eclipse.
Aug 19 10:09:05 <Stummi>	can the current eclipse even run with 1.6?
Aug 19 10:09:11 <davidmichaelkarr>	The best I was able to get on 32-bit windows was 1536mb.
Aug 19 10:09:38 <dimm>	thank you, guyz

Aug 19 18:04:31 <motaka2>	hello from where I can download the latest version of eclipse for linux. I look for the url
Aug 19 18:05:30 <davidmichaelkarr>	motaka2: Just go to https://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php and follow the Download links.
Aug 19 18:06:04 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: i know but I am on a windows machine
Aug 19 18:06:12 <motaka2>	it just suggests me exe

Aug 19 18:38:52 <juacado>	Hi, I'm working in an Eclipse CDT Makefile project, I've added a new make target named 'install' (in the makefile and Make Target inspector) to copy some files to /usr/local/ but when I double-click it I get a 'Permission denied' error (as it's obvious)
Aug 19 18:39:20 <juacado>	so I added a sudo before cp, then I get 'no tty present and no askpass program specified' error
Aug 19 18:39:36 <juacado>	any suggestion that doesn't involve to tweak sudoers file?
Aug 19 19:19:44 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: have you seen this?
Aug 19 19:20:33 <davidmichaelkarr>	motaka2: ?
Aug 19 19:20:47 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: sorry http://www.eclipse.org/rap/
Aug 19 19:21:36 <davidmichaelkarr>	motaka2: Nope, never seen that.
Aug 19 19:22:00 <motaka2>	is there anything wrong with using this for an enterprise project
Aug 19 19:22:00 <motaka2>	?
Aug 19 19:27:11 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: :)
Aug 19 19:30:46 <davidmichaelkarr>	motaka2: Are you really asking me whether I think a tool that I just said I've never heard of is viable to use for projects?
Aug 19 19:32:18 <motaka2>	davidmichaelkarr: yes. I am from php background and I am in primitive steps of creating an automation app with java. every bit of info will be apreciated
Aug 20 07:02:43 <jayaura>	Hi, I have a project that is created in windows. I looked at one of the SDK env vars, and was a windows path. I changed it to linux path. But the change is not reflected in projectinfo.xml How do I regenerate the file ?
Aug 20 07:03:09 <jayaura>	sorry, forgot to mention that I am on linux
Aug 20 08:23:30 <ZeekL>	Heyas, a asset view question.  Using Neon right now.  I have a jar in my Reference Libraries which has some json assets.  When I try to view them it says "Problem opening an editor.  Problem opening editor for 'sample.json': 'System editor can only open file based resources'.  Is there a setting or add on which can let me view those asset resources?
Aug 20 13:13:33 <juacado>	is it not possible to upgrade Mars to Neon? do Ineed to install from scratch?
Aug 20 14:22:55 <davidmichaelkarr>	juacado: believe so, yes.
Aug 20 14:24:14 <Gaulouis>	Hello,
Aug 20 14:24:23 <Gaulouis>	Q: How to install maven plugin ?
Aug 20 14:24:36 <Gaulouis>	I would like to install antlr4-maven-plugin
Aug 20 17:52:46 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Am using Neon and have run into a weird ..thing.  What does it mean when the editor text cursor flips between red and black on a source line?
Aug 20 19:33:29 <motaka2>	has anyone here seen eclipse RAP and scout ? what do you think of it ?
Aug 20 22:35:04 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Is there a way to get the Project Explorer in Eclipse Neon to sort by time/date ?
Aug 20 23:10:48 <thatGuy__>	hello, anyone here?
Aug 21 00:02:58 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: No.
Aug 21 00:03:16 <Frigid_Cryotank>	davidmichaelkarr: Thank you.
Aug 21 00:03:46 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: But note that there are plugins that allow you to open OS file explorer window in the same location.
Aug 21 00:05:31 <Frigid_Cryotank>	<sigh>  Installed Ecipse last Monday... too many plugins.. will check to see if there is a Linux equivalent.
Aug 21 00:11:18 <davidmichaelkarr>	Frigid_Cryotank: Haven't used it, but <https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/open-explorer> appears to do that.
Aug 21 00:11:47 <Frigid_Cryotank>	davidmichaelkarr: Thank you. I'll take a look.
Aug 21 09:39:59 <juacado>	Hi, Eclipse Neon doesn't restart (File menu > Restart), it just quits Eclipse but never launches it again, am I the only one? (I'm using Ubuntu 16.04)
Aug 21 09:40:14 <juacado>	I can't seem to find anything related to that :/
Aug 21 10:02:15 <davidmichaelkarr>	juacado: first, have you turned off gtk3?
Aug 21 11:25:39 <juacado>	davidmichaelkarr, do you mean "Exec=env SWT_GTK3=0 eclipse"? I thought that was only for Mars :)
Aug 21 11:25:42 <juacado>	Thanks for the tip
Aug 21 11:46:09 <davidmichaelkarr>	juacado: There are different ways to do it. I don't know for sure if the GTK3 problems still persist on Neon.  I'd be surprised if it was fixed in Neon.
Aug 21 11:49:21 <juacado>	I added that line to my eclipse.desktop and it works now
Aug 21 14:55:15 <juacado>	I'm in a Makefile project, I've included <memory>, and then in the code I'm using std::shared_ptr, but it's underlined in red and says 'Symbol 'shared_ptr' could not be resolved' so I can't compile from the IDE...
Aug 21 14:55:28 <juacado>	however I can compile from command line with no issues...
Aug 21 14:55:41 <juacado>	I tried rebuilding the index, but no luck :/
Aug 21 14:56:13 <juacado>	in the makefile I'm using -std=c++11
Aug 21 16:15:49 <jablo>	juacado can eclipse find the include file <memory> ? Ie. can you Ctrl-leftclick on  <memory>  and have eclipse open the header file?
Aug 21 17:53:56 <al_nz1>	SO is M2Eclipse already installed in 4.6
Aug 21 18:00:49 <motaka2>	is eclipse RAP a good thing to create tools with it ?
Aug 21 18:05:13 <al_nz1>	But when I go to Run As Maven on a pom file I get "No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?"
Aug 21 18:05:22 <al_nz1>	but i have added the jdk

Aug 22 09:11:45 <sam__>	mvvvv: do you have any idea on that ?
Aug 22 09:11:58 <mvvvv>	sam__, I guess that upgrade to a newest version of eclipse (Neon or Mars) is the solution to this bug :(
Aug 22 09:12:49 <sam__>	so, we can't apply a patch for that ?
Aug 22 09:13:57 <mvvvv>	not for eclipse 4.3

Aug 22 12:50:09 <enleeten>	but make sure to back everything up before editing :)
Aug 22 12:50:40 <guest___>	there is no .project file in the GIT. I am creating new one from scratch during import
Aug 22 12:53:29 <enleeten>	does the git repo contain svn metadata? like a .svn folder?
Aug 22 12:53:48 <guest___>	No, it does not
Aug 22 13:01:26 <guest___>	Ok, I was able to "Import as a general project" and then convert . Still, "import as new" does not work :-(
Aug 22 14:40:40 <Sash>	Hi, in the release note there was the feature announced that neon supports hidpi screens. hot do I activate it (linux, running kde)? right now text and icons are tiny (look unscaled)
Aug 22 15:03:38 <badloop>	so, is it possible to create an eclipse project it a git repository without it having a toplevel folder in the project?
Aug 22 15:03:49 <badloop>	*in a git repository
Aug 22 15:04:15 <nitind>	Too many "it"s.
Aug 22 15:05:12 <badloop>	so many
Aug 22 15:05:15 <badloop>	:-P
Aug 22 15:06:47 <nitind>	Maybe an ~image would help?
Aug 22 15:06:47 <Arbalest>	Please upload your screenshots online and then paste the link back to the channel - http://imgur.com/ - http://imagebin.ca/
Aug 22 15:07:03 <badloop>	screenshot of what?
Aug 22 15:07:16 <nitind>	What it looks like and what it should look like.
Aug 22 15:07:25 <badloop>	ah ok
Aug 22 15:07:29 <badloop>	one sec
Aug 22 15:08:20 <nitind>	Usually the new project wizard offers a "Location" field, possibly in an Advanced section, to let you put the project directory anywhere you want.
Aug 22 15:11:56 <badloop>	essentially, i dont want a project folder in the repo
Aug 22 15:12:05 <badloop>	i just want the *contents* of the project folder in the repo
Aug 22 15:14:06 <badloop>	perhaps i should revisit how i'm storing the data on my server
Aug 22 15:23:42 <Sash>	just in case anyone has the same problem as me (the hidpi issue). that fixed it: "echo Xft.dpi: 190 | xrdb -merge" replace 190 with the right setting for your screen
Aug 22 16:25:07 <cores>	hidpi issue?
Aug 22 17:35:24 <cjoseph>	Hi, I have a project that I imported as an existing git repository a couple months ago. At the time the project was mostly python, but today we added a java folder to the repository
Aug 22 17:35:48 <cjoseph>	what is the best way to add the java nature?
Aug 22 17:36:23 <cjoseph>	is it possible to have a second .project file for this java subfolder?
Aug 22 17:37:03 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: Best to have them as separate projects.
Aug 22 17:37:20 <cjoseph>	I cannot separate them into two git repositories
Aug 22 17:37:24 <cjoseph>	so how will that work?
Aug 22 17:38:28 <cjoseph>	(a higher power than I has decreed that the java and python code shall exist in the same repo)
Aug 22 17:49:39 <nitind>	Are you saying the entire repository is one project in the workspace?  Is the folder in question already being treated as a project?
Aug 22 17:50:21 <cjoseph>	yes
Aug 22 17:50:26 <cjoseph>	nitind: yes
Aug 22 17:50:39 <cjoseph>	I used the "import git" wizard
Aug 22 17:51:02 <cjoseph>	at the time basically everything was python
Aug 22 17:51:38 <cjoseph>	now the existing python/git project has a new java subdirectory
Aug 22 17:52:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: And what is your intention for how the Python code and the Java code would interact?  Would they even be part of the same deployment artifact?
Aug 22 17:53:35 <cjoseph>	they will not interact, but the python code doesn't exist in a neat "python" subdirectory
Aug 22 17:54:00 <cjoseph>	there are half a dozen folders containing python code and this one new java folder
Aug 22 17:54:40 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: So at runtime they are effectively completely separate, and you've decided to essentially lump all the code together, even though they will have nothing to do with each other at runtime?
Aug 22 17:55:27 <cjoseph>	yes
Aug 22 17:55:34 <cjoseph>	as I explained earlier, I have no control over this
Aug 22 17:56:04 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: Yeah, whatever.  Good luck.\
Aug 22 17:56:15 <cjoseph>	thanks?
Aug 22 17:56:20 <cjoseph>	that was very unhelpful
Aug 22 17:56:48 <cjoseph>	everyone else wants to keep the code in one place
Aug 22 18:00:12 <cjoseph>	and I'm trying to find the best way to deal with this decision
Aug 22 18:00:44 <nitind>	Right clikc on the project in the Project Explorer or Navigator and look under the Configure menu.
Aug 22 18:01:56 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: nitind might be able to help you hack together a solution, but lumping all the code into a single project just makes all of it harder to manage.  Bad decision.  Look up "separation of concerns" sometime.
Aug 22 18:02:23 <cjoseph>	nitind: I see options to convert the project to a faceted form, tex, wikitext or javascript ptoject.
Aug 22 18:03:08 <cjoseph>	davidmichaelkarr: it's multiple projects in a single git repository which is somewhat different
Aug 22 18:03:12 <nitind>	Faceted form might allow it to then become a Java project.
Aug 22 18:03:42 <cjoseph>	is there any way to import the subfolder as a new java project?
Aug 22 18:04:23 <nitind>	A subfolder in an existing project?
Aug 22 18:04:28 <cjoseph>	davidmichaelkarr: and you are talking to me as if I made this decision personally, which I did not. I don't need to look up separation of concerns
Aug 22 18:04:34 <cjoseph>	your saltiness is not appreciated
Aug 22 18:05:17 <cjoseph>	nitind: yes...no idea if that's possible but if it is it seems like an easy solution.
Aug 22 18:05:28 <davidmichaelkarr>	cjoseph: Doesn't matter who made it.
Aug 22 18:05:32 <nitind>	I don't think that is supported.
Aug 22 18:07:07 <cjoseph>	davidmichaelkarr: lol yes it does, but whatever. enjoy your hobby of harassing people for things outside of their control on an IRC channel
Aug 22 18:07:30 <cjoseph>	I appreciated your initial advice, however.

Aug 23 03:29:00 <mistria>	eahmedshendy: yes, you can; although I don't know whereas there are many Che users here ATM
Aug 23 03:31:54 <eahmedshendy>	I can only find docker, vargant or yatta as a way of installation

Aug 23 06:00:18 <duelle>	Hi, how can I close only one window of eclipse in i3wm without closing the whole eclipse application?
Aug 23 06:00:44 <duelle>	(Eclipse Neon, Arch Linux, i3wm)
Aug 23 06:21:49 <mistria>	duelle: no issue with other window systems, maybe ask the i3wm community
Aug 23 06:54:42 <duelle>	mistria: Thanks for the hint. But there is no button (apart from the [x] that is not displayed in i3) that closes just the current window (or something similar)?
Aug 23 06:56:09 <mistria>	duelle: I'm not sure I understand the question. Eclipse just looks like other mainstream apps such as Thunderbird, Gimp... regarding buttons on my machine. See screenshots on other WM to figure it out and see how it is different in i3wm
Aug 23 07:00:07 <duelle>	mistria: I have eclipse neon with two windows opened and I can't find a way to close only one window. When I use File->Exit both windows close and when restarting eclipse both windows are back again. I am missing a way/shortcut/button to close one of the windows. As far as I can remember from using xfce this was possible with using the [x] on the titlebar - though there is no such button on the title bar
Aug 23 07:00:13 <duelle>	in tiling wms. I found a similar 'issue' at stackexchange for fvwm (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4812868/how-to-close-an-open-window-of-eclipse) which unfortunately is not applicable for i3wm. What I am looking for is another option/menu entry to close just one window.
Aug 23 07:58:21 <jrtappers>	How would I change how collapsed code looks? My plugin collapses code correctly, but I want it to show only the first line, not the first and last
Aug 23 08:47:45 <Marcel_>	fuck
Aug 23 08:47:47 <Marcel_>	really
Aug 23 08:47:53 <Marcel_>	is there anyone???
Aug 23 10:53:38 <ttwhy>	hey there, is the RDT (remote development tool) usable for every language (e.g. Java with ant files?)
Aug 23 11:29:39 <davidmichaelkarr>	Sigh.  I started up Eclipse on my VM this morning, and I found that the workspace was corrupted.  It didn't seem to think that I had projects in it, even though it tried to restore my last edited files, which presented exceptions when I tried to do anything with them, as it couldn't find the files (even though I can clearly see them when I browse the
Aug 23 11:29:39 <davidmichaelkarr>	workspace outside of Eclipse). This kind of thing happened to me a lot last year, but almost everything is different.  About the only similarity is that I'm running Eclipse in a VM.
Aug 23 17:09:59 <juacado>	How come Eclipse CDT on Neon platform and Ubuntu 16.04 is drawing a red line under shared_ptr and saying 'Symbol could not be resolved'? However it compiles successfully inside the IDE and in command line
Aug 23 17:10:10 <juacado>	I think I've tried everything possible :(
Aug 23 17:47:23 <Abri>	it's on meth
Aug 24 01:23:43 <Amis>	Hello! I'm on Neon (4.6.0) and (C++) when declaring instances of classes Eclipse never offers me any proposals for the expected constructor arguments. This feature never actually worked for me. Is this a bug that's been in the code forever or I have something turned off.
Aug 24 01:24:04 <Amis>	Other proposals work fine and I see this bug has been posted a long time ago and marked as fixed.
Aug 24 01:28:28 <Amis>	Note: code proposal for constructors work when objects are created with "new"
Aug 24 01:28:34 <Amis>	But it does not when created on stack
Aug 24 03:47:51 <juacado>	Amis, what do you mean exactly, for example, that you define a custom constructor with a float as argument and then you hit ctrl+space and nothing shows up?
Aug 24 03:49:10 <Amis>	juacado, a sec, I create an example
Aug 24 03:50:54 <Amis>	juacado, http://pastebin.com/SMgramCE  if I press Ctrl+Space at the last character it does not give me anything.
Aug 24 03:51:28 <Amis>	Howere if I do ---   MyClass * inst = new MyClass(      then it does give me the proper contructor
Aug 24 03:52:39 <juacado>	that's weird, it works for my both ways
Aug 24 03:52:52 <juacado>	I don't know what the problem can be
Aug 24 03:56:01 <Amis>	I just created a brand new workspace with a brand new project and it worked for the first time ONLY. It showed up once but after that it doesn't show hints anymore.
Aug 24 03:58:27 <Amis>	Well yeah this is bullpoo. After restarting that workspace the code completition doesn't even work anymore :V
Aug 24 04:00:34 <Amis>	Oh, it's probably because it's downloading some silly update and that prevents the hint from starting at all
Aug 24 04:18:16 <juacado>	Amis, a different type of question, are you using C++11 features?
Aug 24 04:18:39 <Amis>	juacado, yes
Aug 24 04:19:18 <juacado>	do you have problems with, for example, std::shraed_ptr being underlined in red but the code still compiles succesfully?
Aug 24 05:53:32 <SimonKLB>	hi! anyone know how to make eclipse wrap the first method parameter to a new line if its too long?
Aug 24 05:53:53 <SimonKLB>	i am able to wrap the other parameters, but the first one seem to stick on the same line as the method name
Aug 24 05:56:28 <SimonKLB>	ah, and this is when having the method parameters line up by column, otherwise it's fine as well

Aug 24 09:05:03 <ImNotQ009>	Hello. I'm having a litle problem with the C/C++ IDE. I'm trying to get code indexer to work but it seems it fails to index all of the C++ stuff (like std::strings)
Aug 24 09:05:07 <ImNotQ009>	Any tips, please?
Aug 24 09:05:29 <ImNotQ009>	I'm using Eclipse 4.4
Aug 24 09:08:23 <ImNotQ009>	I added include directories for C and C++ libs in the project settings
Aug 24 09:08:30 <ImNotQ009>	It is finding includes just fine
Aug 24 09:35:25 <mistria>	ImNotQ009: hi, first, use the latest version (Neon, 4.6) of Eclipse IDE for C++ developers. Many things are improved from a version to another and maybe your issue has been worked on during the timeframe
Aug 24 09:35:47 <mistria>	ImNotQ009: you'll have much trouble to find people to give you support on older version on this channel
Aug 24 09:36:43 <ImNotQ009>	mistria: I
Aug 24 09:36:46 <ImNotQ009>	mistria: I'm afraid I can
Aug 24 09:37:07 <ImNotQ009>	*sigh* I'm sorry, I keep pressing enter when I mean to press the apostrophe
Aug 24 09:37:22 <ImNotQ009>	What I meant to say is that I can't use the latest version, because it's buggy for me
Aug 24 09:37:45 <ImNotQ009>	The interface is painfully slow and I experience a lot of line rendering issues
Aug 24 09:37:51 <ImNotQ009>	It's a known bug, I found a report about it
Aug 24 09:38:05 <mistria>	ImNotQ009: which os are you using?
Aug 24 09:38:09 <ImNotQ009>	Ubuntu
Aug 24 09:38:12 <ImNotQ009>	14.04 LTS
Aug 24 09:43:24 <davidmichaelkarr>	ImNotQ009: turn off gtk3.
Aug 24 09:44:40 <ImNotQ009>	Anyway, I fixed the problem, I had a couple things lacking
Aug 24 09:45:13 <ImNotQ009>	davidmichaelkarr: will try next time around, cheers
Aug 24 09:57:30 <Tazmain>	hi all, is there a way for eclipse's web page editor to pick up css and stuff for the preview it shows ?
Aug 24 09:59:32 <Tazmain>	or the web browser to set it up to know where to load the css from
Aug 24 10:01:01 <mistria>	Tazmain: Aren't you using relative path to the CSS file?
Aug 24 10:01:40 <Tazmain>	in this case no.

Aug 24 10:02:58 <Tazmain>	A css profile might work
Aug 24 16:45:18 <juacado>	Hi Amis, did you solve your problem with code completion?
Aug 24 19:37:56 <ISmithers>	Does anyone here use Eclipse to connect to Salesforce orgs via the Force.com plugin?
Aug 25 00:59:24 <Amis>	juacado, nope
Aug 25 00:59:58 <Amis>	juacado, regardig your last question: do you have problems with, for example, std::shraed_ptr being underlined in red but the code still compiles succesfully?
Aug 25 01:00:26 <Amis>	No, I had to set some defines and flags here and there in eclipse to make it work but it knows C++11 now
Aug 25 03:57:46 <juacado>	same as me Amis, it's a bit annoying that it doesn't work just by adding -std=c++11 to the compiler options
Aug 25 04:01:06 <juacado>	in my case the application compiles succesfully and can be launched, the annoying thing is that I get that red line under shared_ptr and an error message saying that Symbol couldn't be resolved
Aug 25 04:13:27 <Amis>	juacado, you have to configure C++11 in the indexer aswell

Aug 25 05:44:03 <dethegeek>	Hi all
Aug 25 05:45:09 <dethegeek>	I switched to Ecliose Neon a few weeks ago, and I noticed I can no longer split the editor view to show 2 different files side by side
Aug 25 09:26:58 <jablo>	In Eclipse-neon the button to terminate a running build (make) seems to be gone!?!??!?
Aug 25 09:30:41 <mvvvv>	jablo, And with the "Task" view ?
Aug 25 09:31:51 <jablo>	He - right now I am stuck with a modal window saying "User Operation is Waiting"... and no way to stop the running build (which is long). I am thinking of going to the command line and "killall eclipse"
Aug 25 09:34:44 <mvvvv>	what is the eclipse package you use ?
Aug 25 09:35:48 <jablo>	Eclipse CDT - strangely enough, now the button is back (the progress window). Hmmm.
Aug 25 09:39:01 <mvvvv>	jablo, may be this can help :http://kaloyanraev.blogspot.fr/2016/04/why-does-building-workspace-block.html
Aug 25 09:39:12 <jablo>	Yes - now again, doing a "build project", I cannot stop the build from the "Progress" tab. The red stop button is gone again.
Aug 25 09:41:15 <jablo>	very annoying
Aug 25 09:41:28 <mvvvv>	what about the link I gave you
Aug 25 09:41:30 <mvvvv>	?
Aug 25 09:42:43 <jablo>	Well, that would help for the situation I was in - except that since I am working in C++, it makes sense to wait for builders. Normally I would be able to *stop* the build from that dialog, which is fine. But now in Neon it seems not possible.
Aug 25 09:43:27 <jablo>	Oh, now suddenly after quite a while, the res "stop" button is back on the progress tab. Odd.
Aug 25 09:44:06 <mvvvv>	what is the value in preferences/ Run Debug / Launching/ Wait for ongoing build .... ?
Aug 25 09:45:12 <jablo>	"Never"
Aug 25 09:45:21 <mvvvv>	so ... Prompt ?
Aug 25 09:46:52 <jablo>	Hmm - my goal really is to be able to stop a running build.
Aug 25 09:47:08 <mvvvv>	and with prompt ?
Aug 25 09:47:29 <jablo>	mvvv, LOL - alright alright - :-D
Aug 25 09:47:38 <mvvvv>	^_^
Aug 25 09:49:01 <jablo>	Then the red "Stop" button seems to be consistently there in the Progress tab from the start of my build. Nice.

Aug 29 11:06:40 <mistria>	Lone_Rifle mvvvv: https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ecafaq.php , the Eclipse contributor License agreement has to be signed on the Eclipse Profile page https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/myaccount.php#open_tab_cla
Aug 29 11:07:49 <mvvvv>	mistria For Github ??
Aug 29 11:08:32 <mistria>	mvvvv: I believe so, IIRC, Eclipse adds an additional IP check which verifies one has signed the Eclipse Contributor Agreement
Aug 29 11:08:50 <mistria>	mvvvv: it's reported like a test pass or failure
Aug 29 11:10:01 <mistria>	mvvvvv: see https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/2234 for an example, the "ip-validation" at the bottom
Aug 29 11:10:16 <mistria>	mvvvv: though this one is not about ECA
Aug 29 11:12:41 <enleeten>	could it be something with that new contributor agreement?
Aug 29 11:13:59 <enleeten>	nm missed the bottom comments due to scrollback
Aug 29 12:24:42 <TML>	Is there a way to make "Eclipse Intaller.app" use my existing, fully functional JDK instead of looking for Apple's unsupported, legacy 1.6 JDK?
Aug 29 15:40:52 <purplex88>	In Eclipse Java, If I type 'S' it brings up a long autocomplete list of stuff that starts with 'S' and when I press backspace to delete 'S' the autocomplete list doesn't go away.
Aug 29 15:41:28 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Press Escape.
Aug 29 15:42:31 <purplex88>	can i make it work with backpace?
Aug 29 15:42:45 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: No.
Aug 29 15:42:49 <purplex88>	list still being there seems unnecessary if i delete it
Aug 29 15:45:39 <nitind>	Did you set it to automatically show the list when you type 'S'?
Aug 29 15:47:11 <purplex88>	i have set all the alphabetic characters under Windows menu -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Content assist
Aug 29 20:36:47 <Keitaro>	hello is there anybody here plz ?
Aug 29 20:37:30 <Keitaro>	i have a problem on eclipse when i try to build the project it said : cannot find -lpthread
Aug 29 20:37:33 <IstiCusi>	Keitaro: yes
Aug 29 20:38:03 <Keitaro>	c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/5.3.0/../../../../mingw32/bin/ld.exe: cannot find -lpthread
Aug 29 20:38:10 <Keitaro>	i don't know why
Aug 29 20:38:35 <IstiCusi>	sorry, no idea
Aug 29 20:38:38 <Keitaro>	i install mingw with the installer and use eclipse last version for C/C++ dev
Aug 29 20:39:06 <Keitaro>	if i am on windows 64 bit mingw 32 bit works ?
Aug 29 20:39:15 <Keitaro>	or did i have to take the 64 one ?
Aug 30 07:47:05 <greenit>	hi, i have two folders which have identical things in it. one is a svn-synchronized folder, the other one is a linked folder to a share. I need both to be on the same state. is it somehow possible to automatically get all changes i make in one of the folders in the other one too?
Aug 30 07:47:25 <greenit>	both are imported into eclipse
Aug 30 08:42:30 <sasadw4748>	hello?

Sep 01 11:08:11 <Gamoder_>	Hi everyone, is there a way to find out whether eclipse has "crashed" or just takes a long time when editing java files?
Sep 01 11:08:54 <nitind>	~hang
Sep 01 11:08:54 <Arbalest>	In a deadlock or curious what's eating up CPU? http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/How_to_report_a_deadlock
Sep 01 11:10:49 <Gamoder_>	well, it is in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.parser.Scanner
Sep 01 11:11:22 <Gamoder_>	more specifically, in the constructor (probably, it is called <init>)
Sep 01 11:12:44 <Gamoder_>	here is the threaddump: http://pastebin.com/bMjyV1gj
Sep 01 11:15:14 <Gamoder_>	argh, it even happens without code completion
Sep 01 11:17:38 <Gamoder_>	Probably lambdas are the problem
Sep 01 11:17:53 <Gamoder_>	I am using eclipse mars and the support doesn't seem good. If I remove the Lambda, it is ok
Sep 01 11:21:42 <nitind>	What happens with Neon?
Sep 01 11:23:44 <Gamoder_>	don't know, haven't tried it yet
Sep 01 15:05:16 <badloop>	is it possible to launch just any old application in a generic tab in eclipse somehow?
Sep 01 16:03:26 <hanshenrik>	when Neon says it needs the path to a Java 1.8+ VM, does it really mean an ancient jre 1.x release, meaning that my open-jdk 7u111 should suffice, or does it mean something else, like java 8~?
Sep 01 16:03:46 <hanshenrik>	(Neon installer)
Sep 01 16:08:44 <badloop>	hanshenrik: it means java 8
Sep 01 16:08:55 <badloop>	1.8 is the actual release number
Sep 01 16:10:39 <nitind>	"Java 8" is branding.
Sep 01 16:14:37 <hanshenrik>	oh kk
Sep 01 20:44:54 <zave>	could someone give me a definitive link to where one can download the bpmn diagram editor for eclipse (mars.2)?
Sep 01 20:45:37 <zave>	i've been trying this one: http://download.eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler/updates/mars/1.2.4/, but i keep getting an unknown host error.
Sep 01 21:03:39 <Smarticles101>	quick question...  what are the recommended requirements for eclipse?
Sep 01 21:46:20 <hanshenrik_>	over 9001 ghz everything
Sep 01 21:46:57 <hanshenrik_>	j/k, but eclipse is known for being really slow compared to other IDE's
Sep 01 21:48:36 <hanshenrik_>	(meanwhile i use a high-end system, so i don't really notice. i guess most eclipse core devs do too)
Sep 02 03:11:28 <chele>	hi there, how do i remove this exception: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.internal.core.dom.binding.VariableBinding cannot be cast to org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.core.dom.IFunctionBinding . it continuously pops up a window which makes the experience of using eclipse unpleasant.
Sep 02 03:12:32 <chele>	the whole trace http://paste.debian.net/803247/ btw i am using eclipse neon
Sep 02 03:15:59 <mvvvv>	chele, Have a look to this : https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=496749

Sep 04 19:37:23 <al_nz1>	so when I create a new java project in eclipse, there is /src/main/java and /src/test/java - I can understand the main folder structure,but why is a /test/ one getting created?
Sep 04 19:39:05 <davidmichaelkarr>	al_nz1: to encourage you to write unit tests.
Sep 04 19:46:25 <al_nz1>	ok, I will google and read up on it
Sep 04 20:07:55 <al_nz1>	I am trying to follow this tutorial : http://www.mkyong.com/webservices/jax-rs/jersey-hello-world-example/ - but since I am using Java (I think with the M2 plugin) I am not using the commandlines

Sep 04 23:26:59 <jancoow>	Hi there. I want to move from coocox to eclipse. However, coocox works a little bit strange.
Sep 04 23:27:30 <jancoow>	Every directory in the coocox project is linked to "/"
Sep 04 23:28:02 <jancoow>	So, if i have a file in /test/test.c and i want to include it in main.c i have to type include test.c instead of /test/test.c
Sep 04 23:28:08 <jancoow>	Is this also possible in eclipse?
Sep 04 23:57:32 <jeen>	jancoow, I'm not a C developer but I think you might be able to configure a project's build paths to achieve that. In project -> configuration, at a guess.
Sep 05 00:01:54 <jancoow>	jeen: yeah well c usually doesnt have folders, it more catogorisation of files
Sep 05 00:02:06 <jancoow>	so do i need to set every directory as build path
Sep 05 00:02:13 <jancoow>	or what is the different with source folder?
Sep 05 00:03:24 <TheChubu>	also eclipse works fine with links
Sep 05 00:03:57 <TheChubu>	you can set it up to copy the linked file, or to link to the folder, or just make your own system links in whatever os you use
Sep 05 00:07:10 <jancoow>	meh that won't work
Sep 05 00:26:07 <jancoow>	okay beside the include fact it won't compile in ecilpse, ugh
Sep 05 01:29:31 <jvava>	dear, im trying to play a javascript project in eclipse neon,   all ok, but there are many error/warning for node_module, which i notice is excluded. does you met this issue?
Sep 05 02:23:18 <jvava>	jsdt, error/warning, node_modules !!!!
Sep 05 02:24:03 <davidmichaelkarr>	jvava: You're going to have to be more specific.  Exclamation points without showing any real information doesn't help.
Sep 05 02:24:35 <jvava>	ok, let me say in detail
Sep 05 02:26:59 <jvava>	i have a javascript project with npm management,  in eclipse neon, though i check and foudn node_modules directory is excluded from include path,  but validator still report error/warning for the node_moduels, that is just boring. please help.
Sep 05 02:27:44 <davidmichaelkarr>	Well, if pages are trying to include files in node_modules, and you have it excluded, then you should probably change that.
Sep 05 02:28:22 <davidmichaelkarr>	jvava: And you still haven't told us what those errors or warnings are.
Sep 05 02:29:44 <jvava>	1. Duplicate key 'a'  2. Expected value  3. illegal return statement
Sep 05 02:30:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	jvava: Can't tell anything from those.
Sep 05 02:30:41 <jvava>	davidmichaelkarr,  in node_module directory, there are chance test file exist,
Sep 05 02:32:09 <jvava>	even though no test file, maybe a old/third library conflicted with new grammar but can run, so i need exclude that from validator
Sep 05 02:33:39 <jvava>	so i need not see the red error/warning,
Sep 05 02:57:56 <jvava>	who is in charge of the jsdt development,  i have question for you
Sep 05 05:35:07 <jvava>	hi

Sep 05 20:44:09 <davidmichaelkarr>	jancoow1: if you're not using a c++ compiler, it won't be defined.
Sep 06 00:41:21 <metaspike>	hi! I want to work on a remote project with eclipse, is there a agnostic way to do this through ssh?
Sep 06 00:42:11 <metaspike>	or, a 'general way' rather, eg. remote project can be of any project type, but I can load that project into eclipse from remote fs
Sep 06 00:42:27 <metaspike>	and -not- through sshfs :) this is really slow
Sep 06 00:43:10 <metaspike>	I was looking at PTP, but it seems to be specific to C++ / java
Sep 06 00:45:59 <metaspike>	and installing it didn't provide the expected New > Other > Syncronized Project thing anyway so. stumped
Sep 06 02:21:11 <al_nz1>	Why when I add the jars to /WEB-INF/lib do are my imports not recognised?
Sep 06 02:57:08 <al_nz1>	can somebody please help me out trying to follow this tutorial http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/REST/article.html
Sep 06 02:57:17 <al_nz1>	when I try to run my project I get :
Sep 06 02:57:33 <al_nz1>	Servlet [Jersey REST Service] in web application [/com.vogella.jersey.first] threw load() exception
Sep 06 02:57:34 <al_nz1>	java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer
Sep 06 03:19:09 <mistria>	al_nz1: consider using JBoss Tools, it may help
Sep 06 03:22:03 <al_nz1>	mistria: ok, I will take a look, but finding it really frustrating to not be able to follow a darn tutorial
Sep 06 03:22:20 <al_nz1>	I am using maven so all the deps stuff should be handled
Sep 06 03:25:33 <mistria>	al_nz1: there are some deps that are assumed to be "provided" by the JEE server
Sep 06 03:25:56 <mistria>	al_nz1: also, maybe your server isn't using Jersey for Jax-RS
Sep 06 03:26:12 <al_nz1>	Its tomcat. How would I check?
Sep 06 03:26:19 <mistria>	al_nz1: if you tell Maven that dep is provided, but it's not; then it ends up being missing
Sep 06 03:26:37 <mistria>	al_nz1: I don't know, I rarely use Tomcat (exactly for this kind of reasons)
Sep 06 03:27:15 <al_nz1>	sure looks provided : https://snag.gy/pUXncy.jpg
Sep 06 03:28:16 <mistria>	al_nz1: whether the dependency gets included or not in your app depends on the Maven scope
Sep 06 03:28:21 <al_nz1>	oh yep, fair enough, though this doenst look like a tomcat issue
Sep 06 03:28:42 <al_nz1>	dont supose you would be interested in taking a look at my screen?
Sep 06 03:28:48 <mistria>	al_nz1: it is an integration issue , that you have specifically because you're using Tomcat ;)
Sep 06 03:28:52 <al_nz1>	i have wasted two days on this
Sep 06 03:29:10 <mistria>	al_nz1: if you were using a real JEE server, Jax-RS is embedded and usually working better (that's JEE spec)
Sep 06 03:29:46 <al_nz1>	a real JEE server being?
Sep 06 03:32:11 <mistria>	al_nz1: WildFly
Sep 06 03:33:07 <mistria>	al_nz1: or any of http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/compatibility-jsp-136984.html
Sep 06 03:34:28 <al_nz1>	so glassfish, wildfly, tomcat, jetty are all JEE servers?
Sep 06 03:42:46 <mistria>	tomcat and jetty are not full JEE servers
Sep 06 03:42:58 <mistria>	they do not implement the Jax-RS specification for example
Sep 06 03:43:08 <mistria>	they only implement the Servlet one and a few others
Sep 06 03:44:41 <mistria>	al_nz1: basically with Tomcat, if you want Jax-RS you have to add it by yourself (and deal with potential integration issues), if you use Wildfly, it's there, tested and certified as working
Sep 06 03:53:35 <purplex88>	why the user dictionary is not working?
Sep 06 03:54:28 <purplex88>	I right click on the word > Add to dictionary
Sep 06 03:54:56 <purplex88>	It brings a preference dialog where i set the path to user defined dictionary and click ok
Sep 06 03:55:24 <purplex88>	After that it doesn't add the word
Sep 06 04:03:32 <mistria>	purplex88: does your user defined dictionary contain the word? Maybe you have to close your editor and open it again.
Sep 06 04:04:44 <purplex88>	mistria: the file is not even created
Sep 06 04:05:19 <purplex88>	i specified: "mydic.txt" in eclipse folder
Sep 06 04:05:41 <mistria>	purplex88: I believe it's your responsibility to create the file (and maybe even edit it), the action name may be misleading
Sep 06 04:06:05 <purplex88>	even edit it?
Sep 06 04:06:40 <mistria>	purplex88: maybe, I don't know, I don't use it
Sep 06 04:07:00 <purplex88>	it action clearly says "Add <word> to dictionary"
Sep 06 04:27:45 <mistria>	purplex88: well, you tried, it doesn't do what it says. So it's most likely a bug (in the action or its name)
Sep 06 04:27:53 <mistria>	purplex88: http://bugs.eclipse.org
Sep 06 04:52:02 <purplex88>	Really?
Sep 06 04:53:03 <purplex88>	How can this bug still be there? It should have been fixed since its a very function
Sep 06 04:53:11 <purplex88>	basic function*
Sep 06 04:55:18 <mistria>	purplex88: it's probably still here because no-one reported it previously
Sep 06 04:55:36 <mistria>	purplex88: and not many people use care about spelling in the Eclipse IDE
Sep 06 04:55:46 <purplex88>	or no one uses dictionary lol
Sep 06 04:55:50 <mistria>	purplex88: it's the kind of things that's easily unnoticed
Sep 06 07:54:30 <Ben_1>	hi

Sep 08 09:10:12 <lyubenblagoev>	Hello everybody, I'm having an issue with Eclipse "Next Editor" and "Previous Editor" commands (those commands are bound to Ctrl+F6 and Shift+Ctrl+F6 by default). I'm running it on Linux with Gnome 3.20. Both commands don't work even after I changed the default key binding. Does anyone else have the same issue?
Sep 08 09:11:26 <lyubenblagoev>	I've tried them on a Windows VM that I have and both commands work. I also googled for similar issues but all issues I found are too old.
Sep 08 11:56:50 <davidmichaelkarr>	Wow, m2e is really aggravating me. For some reason, when I do "update project" on a particular project, it keeps on replacing my JDK 1.8 library with a JDK 1.5 library, and then because of that fails facet constraints and other things. I can't figure out what is making it do this.
Sep 08 12:01:33 <davidmichaelkarr>	Ok. Figured it out. I didn't have a "maven-compiler-plugin" config for that project (it actually is just a html/javascript war, with no java), so apparently that was making it default to 1.5.  I just added the missing config and now it isn't losing its mind.
Sep 08 13:49:53 <davidmichaelkarr>	Sigh. The Tomcat server config in Eclipse is fragile. It can just start failing for no obvious reason. The only fix I've found is to recreate the server def and copy in all my required settings, and then it just works fine again. Annoying.
Sep 08 14:41:13 <nitind>	Do you have logs of the failures?
Sep 08 14:54:39 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: yes, but it doesn't really tell me anything.  It tells me that it couldn't find the class.  Duh.  You told me that already. :)
Sep 08 14:55:13 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: "you" being Eclipse, obviously.
Sep 08 14:57:06 <davidmichaelkarr>	lyubenblagoev: If you're still around, by "don't work", do you mean that pressing the key doesn't appear to execute the desired function?  Do you see any binding conflicts in the Eclipse log file?
Sep 08 17:23:42 <n3m0>	Hi there! I have a question regarding the neon/mars releases: How can I add flags for the building to projects?
Sep 08 17:33:31 <n3m0>	I am more specifically struggling on how to set it up in order to link libraries
Sep 08 17:36:58 <n3m0>	And I guess I should add that I use eclipse for c++ development
Sep 09 01:49:06 <lyubenblagoev>	davidmichaelkarr: I don't see any conflicts at least in the keys dialog. I tried to change it to another key combinations without effect. When I press the keys nothing happens (usually a list of editors is shown and on every subsequent keypres the selection in the list is changed). After pressing the keys multiple times the list appears but I cannot select anything except with the mouse but the active editor doesn't change.
Sep 09 01:49:53 <lyubenblagoev>	That happened when I changed the keybinding to Ctrl + Shift + ] and i hold Ctrl + Shift while pressing multiple times ]
Sep 09 02:29:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	lyubenblagoev: I'm guessing this isn't a binding problem per se.  Can you press Ctrl+shift+l (ell), which should list current key bindings, and then scroll down to "Next Editor" and press enter on that?
Sep 09 02:35:13 <lyubenblagoev>	davidmichaelkarr, I also think this isn't a binding problem.
Sep 09 02:35:32 <lyubenblagoev>	I tried what you suggested and the editors list popped up
Sep 09 02:35:49 <lyubenblagoev>	but I can't scroll and select any items in it
Sep 09 02:35:59 <lyubenblagoev>	I can select only with mouse
Sep 09 02:36:07 <lyubenblagoev>	and this doesn't change the current editor
Sep 09 02:36:28 <lyubenblagoev>	Ctrl+F8 (next perspective) also doesn't work for me
Sep 09 02:42:46 <davidmichaelkarr>	lyubenblagoev: What platform are you on?
Sep 09 02:44:18 <davidmichaelkarr>	lyubenblagoev: And have you inspected the eclipse log yet?
Sep 09 02:45:40 <lyubenblagoev>	davidmichaelkarr, I'm on Arch Linux with Gnome 3.20.2 with Eclipse Neon
Sep 09 02:45:52 <lyubenblagoev>	davidmichaelkarr, I wrote that in my first message
Sep 09 02:46:25 <lyubenblagoev>	I'm currently tailing the output of workspace/.metadata/.log but no messages are logged there when I try to switch editors or perspectives
Sep 09 02:47:09 <davidmichaelkarr>	lyubenblagoev: I know that Ubuntu has issues with GTK3, I have no idea if that platform would have issues with it. Have you attempted to turn off GTK3?
Sep 09 02:49:48 <lyubenblagoev>	davidmichaelkarr, yes, I've already turned GTK3 off and using GTK2
Sep 09 02:59:16 <lyubenblagoev>	Is there anyone else using Linux to confirm whether or not he or she is having the same issues as me?
Sep 09 03:02:49 <mvvvv>	lyubenblagoev, can you repost your problem ?
Sep 09 03:08:27 <lyubenblagoev>	mvvvv, I'm having an issue with Eclipse "Next Editor" and "Previous Editor" commands (those commands are bound to Ctrl+F6 and Shift+Ctrl+F6 by default). I'm running it on Linux with Gnome 3.20. Both commands don't work even after I changed the default key binding. The Next Perspective (Ctrl+F8) also doesn't seem to work.
Sep 09 03:09:47 <lyubenblagoev>	I've set Ctrl+Tab and Shift+Ctrl+Tab to the Next Tab / Previous Tab bindings and they do work, but I want to be able to go to the previously opened tab, while Previous / Next Tab go to the tab before or after the currently opened tab.
Sep 09 03:12:21 <lyubenblagoev>	I found the following in the Eclipse Bugzilla: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=474449
Sep 09 03:12:35 <lyubenblagoev>	but it doesn't seem to be resolved yet
Sep 09 03:13:06 <lyubenblagoev>	probably I'm hitting the same issue
Sep 09 03:16:30 <mvvvv>	looks like gnome do not release ctrl+f6
Sep 09 03:19:48 <mvvvv>	Don't you have a gnome-shell extension using these shortcuts ?
Sep 09 03:20:18 <lyubenblagoev>	mvvvv, no I don't
Sep 09 03:20:46 <lyubenblagoev>	mvvvv, I've also remapped to different keys and still doesn't work
Sep 09 03:21:24 <davidmichaelkarr>	lyubenblagoev: Considering it still behaved strangely when you executed it directly from the bindings list, it's not just a binding problem.
Sep 09 03:24:15 <lyubenblagoev>	davidmichaelkarr, agree. It's not the binding
Sep 09 05:02:41 <mvvvv>	lyubenblagoev, I'm testing on gnome-shell 20 (ubuntu version) I do not have the problem
Sep 09 05:03:22 <lyubenblagoev>	mvvvv, thank you for testing this
Sep 09 08:12:15 <hanshenrik>	i think i found a bug in 4.6.0; the start page has this "Review IDE configuration settings: Review the IDE's most fiercely contested preferences" , that thing may be slow to respond when clicked on, which might prompt the user to click on it several times before it opens. then, when it first actually opens, it opens a window for every time the user clicked on it. clicked on it 10 times? it opens 10 copies of the window. pretty sure
Sep 09 08:12:15 <hanshenrik>	that's not supposed to happen

Sep 13 11:04:12 <caturday>	hello all
Sep 13 11:04:24 <fares>	hey guys this will seem silly but whenever I press on a line, the entire line is highlighted... do u know how to fix this?
Sep 13 11:04:56 <caturday>	i've got a dynamic web module project with some jsps and a custom jstl taglib
Sep 13 11:06:08 <caturday>	for whatever reason, every time i maven rebuild the project, all of my custom tags with references to the taglib they're in cause "can not find the tag library descriptor for /path/to/tag/lib"
Sep 13 11:06:23 <caturday>	errors, specifically on the @taglib lnie
Sep 13 11:06:25 <caturday>	line*
Sep 13 11:06:45 <caturday>	and then /eventually/ those errors go away
Sep 13 11:06:50 <caturday>	but after quite a bit of time
Sep 13 11:07:44 <caturday>	i figure this has to be some weird discrepency between what maven has built and the eclipse jsp validator
Sep 13 11:08:02 <caturday>	the strange thing is that this doesn't happen in any of my jsps with references to the same taglib
Sep 13 11:08:06 <caturday>	only the tags within
Sep 13 11:11:55 <fares>	nevermind got it to work...
Sep 13 11:19:36 <nitind>	caturday: Not sure I understand what you mean. You're talking about tag files?
Sep 13 11:19:59 <caturday>	yeah
Sep 13 11:20:11 <caturday>	so i've got tag files defined as part of a taglib
Sep 13 11:20:30 <nitind>	And they have taglib directives in them themselves?
Sep 13 11:21:08 <caturday>	i'm willing to admit that this might be misunderstanding on my part, but... yes
Sep 13 11:21:13 <caturday>	references to their own taglib
Sep 13 11:21:25 <caturday>	because some of the tags are composed of other tags in the same library
Sep 13 11:32:22 <nitind>	I think it's a bug. In http://git.eclipse.org/c/sourceediting/webtools.sourceediting.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.jst.jsp.core/src/org/eclipse/jst/jsp/core/internal/taglib/TaglibHelperManager.java#n120 .  I've added a note to ~421146 .

Sep 13 11:39:14 <caturday>	thanks, nitind
Sep 13 15:38:32 <ipun>	Hi, is there a method to check if eclipse is currently themed?
Sep 13 17:06:53 <Kaje>	There is some way to get information about parts in a current workbench, but I can't remember what it is called.
Sep 13 17:07:30 <Kaje>	It is some hot key that will let you select a part in Eclipse and it will tell you a bunch of information about it, such as what bundle it comes from...
Sep 13 17:07:43 <Kaje>	Can someone remind me what I'm thinking of?

Sep 13 21:59:43 <Vivekananda>	hi. anyone knows gradle ?
Sep 13 22:14:36 <promach>	what does the comment in https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&th=1081105&goto=1743172&#msg_1743172 means ?
Sep 13 22:14:48 <promach>	how would I proceed ?
Sep 13 22:55:41 <davidmichaelkarr>	promach: Uh, see if you can build it from the command line outside of Eclipse?
Sep 13 22:56:03 <davidmichaelkarr>	Vivekananda: If you have a question, ask it, but it might be better to ask it on the Gradle Forum site.
Sep 13 22:57:36 <promach>	I think I need to install arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc
Sep 13 23:00:15 <Vivekananda>	davidmichaelkarr, if there is an irc channel on a different server for gradle please let me know. My question is I have separate gradle projects ( ie separated folders each with a gradle.build file) for lessons in java collections tutorial. I wanted to import all folders in one superfolder and then work on those. But on doing it the gradle.build files give an error on trying to build: The folder 'superfolder' is not
Sep 13 23:00:15 <Vivekananda>	backed by gradle. So how do I do this ?
Sep 13 23:04:15 <davidmichaelkarr>	Vivekananda: There is #gradle, but I'm saying you'll get a better response on the Gradle Forum site, not IRC.
Sep 13 23:04:36 <Vivekananda>	hmm ok
Sep 14 02:12:03 <tippy>	hey all
Sep 14 02:12:55 <tippy>	I'm getting the unhandled event error, and I've tried all the fixes
Sep 14 02:16:57 <promach>	davidmichaelkarr: I have already installed arch-linux package for ARM cross-compile libraries (arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc) an restarted Xilinx SDK. I can build it outside eclipse with only command line gcc. However, I still have unresolved inclusion for stdio.h
Sep 14 03:40:08 <Stummi>	Quick question: is there any way to easily find out which preferences option provided a particular color used in the editor? I am using a dark theme, some editors still use dark colors for some parts of the syntax highlighting and I often find myself having a hard time figuring out where to change this color
Sep 14 03:52:17 <mvvvv>	Stummi, I'm afraid it's still a mess to find the right one
Sep 14 04:34:59 <Anticom>	Hi all. I'm running Eclipse Luna CDT on Linux. I was wondering, whether it was possible to configure it to properly build an autotools based project. I couldn't find anything online concerning this
Sep 14 04:40:25 <Anticom>	oh nvm, found it
Sep 14 05:00:48 <Velho>	Why's a maven project so hard to setup on Eclipse?
Sep 14 05:09:49 <Anticom>	Hm, that's really weird. I've installed eclipse cdt from the official ubuntu sources now (for whatever reason it's only v3.8.1). There's no gnu autotools option aswell

Sep 14 12:33:09 <loganrun>	is there any way to fix this
Sep 14 12:34:48 <mvvvv>	loganrun, what's the message when you launch it from command line ?
Sep 14 12:37:17 <loganrun>	don't see any message
Sep 14 12:37:43 <loganrun>	OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: ignoring option MaxPermSize=256m; support was removed in 8.0
Sep 14 12:38:28 <loganrun>	is there a way to force a scan for plugins
Sep 14 12:39:03 <davidmichaelkarr>	loganrun: You mean updates for them?  Just do "Help"->"Check for updates".
Sep 14 12:39:29 <loganrun>	no trying to figure out why pydev won't show up after I install it
Sep 14 12:40:48 <loganrun>	is there a way to run it manually or figure out whatversion of java it is using
Sep 14 12:42:21 <loganrun>	I am thinking it may be using some ancient version of java or something
Sep 14 12:46:55 <loganrun>	anybody know why eclipse doesn't reconize the pydev plugin
Sep 14 12:48:17 <mvvvv>	you're using openjdk 8 (or above)
Sep 14 12:49:42 <mvvvv>	do you have a workspace created or not ?
Sep 14 12:50:13 <loganrun>	yes using openjdk 8, tried installing 9 but eclipse just crashes
Sep 14 12:50:55 <loganrun>	so if I go to about eclipse it shows pydev for eclipse 5.2.0.20168171824
Sep 14 12:51:15 <loganrun>	  PyDev for Eclipse	5.2.0.201608171824	org.python.pydev.feature.feature.group	Fabio Zadrozny
Sep 14 12:52:15 <loganrun>	when I do the updates it presuably puts them in ~/.eclipse/
Sep 14 12:52:34 <loganrun>	but it seems like the module does't really do anything
Sep 14 12:52:55 <mvvvv>	so liclipse is running but you don't see the ? editor ?
Sep 14 12:53:35 <loganrun>	I don't see pydev perspective etc.
Sep 14 12:53:44 <loganrun>	eclipse seems to work fine otherwise
Sep 14 12:54:01 <mvvvv>	how did you downloaded pydev ?
Sep 14 12:55:27 <mvvvv>	sorry I have to quit
Sep 14 12:55:33 <loganrun>	from install software: PyDev - http://pydev.org/updates
Sep 14 12:55:46 <loganrun>	from within eclipse
Sep 14 12:55:55 <loganrun>	is it getting the wrong version or something
Sep 14 12:57:25 <loganrun>	is there an error log or something
Sep 14 13:02:30 <davidmichaelkarr>	loganrun: There's an Eclipse log at .metadata/.log , in your workspace.

Sep 15 03:58:41 <Anticom>	Hi all. I'm currently maintaining a legacy project where no build files exist but it is only buildable with eclipse CDT. Now in the project settings where the GCC tools are configured i see "${workspace_loc:/foo/bar}". How is ${workspace_loc:/path} different from ${workspace_loc}/path ?
Sep 15 04:01:43 <mvvvv>	they are two different variables : http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fconcepts-exttools.htm
Sep 15 04:04:08 <Anticom>	mvvvv: I just also noticed in the link you gave me there was project_loc... I've been using ProjDirPath for quite some time... Is this obsolete?
Sep 15 04:04:26 <Anticom>	Because from what i see they should point to the same path, shouldn't they?
Sep 15 04:07:32 <mvvvv>	looks like a variable added by some tools. Don't know it
Sep 15 04:10:59 <mvvvv>	no it's in the list of variable for cdt (see Pref / C++ build / Build variables)
Sep 15 04:11:53 <mvvvv>	using project proterties you can add this variable to your project variable list
Sep 15 05:04:03 <Anticom>	Hi all. I'm running Eclipse CDT (3.8.1) on Ubuntu. I've enabled "CDT GCC Built-in Compiler Settings" Provider in "C/C++ General" > "Preprocessor Includes" and triggered an Indexer rebuilt but it still fails to find standard headers like <string>, <iostream> or3rd party libraries like <boost/filesystem/path.hpp>
Sep 15 05:04:06 <Anticom>	What am i missing?
Sep 15 05:05:35 <mvvvv>	Anticom, don't use the old eclipse from ubuntu is outdated
Sep 15 05:07:33 <Anticom>	mvvvv: My VM runs ubuntu 14.04 LTS and i hadn't much luck installing eclipse neon because of jdk8
Sep 15 05:08:00 <Anticom>	I've got default-jre installed
Sep 15 05:08:51 <Anticom>	Any suggestions?
Sep 15 05:09:32 <mvvvv>	Anticom, http://www.webupd8.org/2012/09/install-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-via-ppa.html
Sep 15 05:12:05 <Anticom>	Hm, i'd rather go for openjdk. According to (german) ubuntu wiki there's a ppa for it aswell: ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
Sep 15 05:15:32 <mvvvv>	you may also have a problem with gtk3 : export SWT_GTK3=0   before launching eclipse
Sep 15 05:48:51 <Anticom>	mvvvv: Okay i've upgraded to eclipse neon but the problem still resides
Sep 15 05:51:06 <mvvvv>	Anticom, did you create a new project or is it an old one imported ?
Sep 15 05:51:08 <Anticom>	Oh wait, think i've figured it out. The indexer was using a (currently) broken build config. Didn't know you could specify which one the indexer should use.
Sep 15 05:51:16 <Anticom>	mvvvv: it's an old imported one
Sep 15 05:51:25 <Anticom>	Indexer is currently doing a refresh
Sep 15 05:51:51 <Anticom>	Yep, that was the issue
Sep 15 07:09:26 <jrtappers>	Is there a best class to extend if I want to make my own IDocument that is just like the default one, just with added methods
Sep 15 09:53:46 <Anticom>	My eclipse neon suddenly started opening and switching tabs randomly
Sep 15 09:54:11 <Anticom>	Like i did some edit and wanted to save and before i was able to it switched to another tab
Sep 15 09:54:17 <Anticom>	Is this a known problem?
Sep 15 10:00:37 <davidmichaelkarr>	Anticom: platform?
Sep 15 10:09:01 <mvvvv>	davidmichaelkarr, I think it's ubuntu 14.04
Sep 15 10:19:02 <davidmichaelkarr>	Make sure gtk3 is turned off.
Sep 15 10:19:41 <davidmichaelkarr>	Anticom: make sure gtk3 is turned off.
Sep 15 10:21:36 <Anticom>	Can i do this in eclipse.ini or do i have to do this via environment?
Sep 15 10:21:43 <Anticom>	^ davidmichaelkarr
Sep 15 11:33:56 <altendky>	i would like to have a build option that does not get committed and is 'easily' accessible in the gui.  we revision control .project and .cproject presently.  for context, the option would build the embedded application such that it uses defaults rather than loading saved parameters.  does eclipse provide a feature for this?
Sep 15 12:42:26 <bgunter>	i think the virgo website might have been compromised
Sep 15 12:42:42 <bgunter>	i'm browsing the docks and i keep getting popup windows that go to URLs like this
Sep 15 12:42:48 <bgunter>	*docs
Sep 15 12:42:52 <bgunter>	http://quickdomainfwd.com/?dn=loopfuse.net&pid=9PO755G95
Sep 15 12:47:56 <bgunter>	example of a page that gave me that popup when i clicked a link http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/documentation/virgo-documentation-3.7.0.M01/docs/virgo-user-guide/html/ch01.html#d0e102
Sep 15 12:52:51 <purplex88>	whats the latest stable eclipse IDE?
Sep 15 12:54:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Neon (4.6.0).
Sep 15 12:54:45 <purplex88>	can't find 4.6 here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/all
Sep 15 12:56:02 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Site seems a little confused right now. Not sure what's going on there.
Sep 15 12:56:45 <purplex88>	well it doesn't number any of releases
Sep 15 12:57:09 <purplex88>	all i see is m1, m2, m3.. RC etc
Sep 15 12:57:46 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Yes, I can see that.  It's broken.  I don't know what's wrong.  You can normally just click the "Download" link at https://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php , but that's broken also.
Sep 15 12:59:33 <purplex88>	is eclipse dying?
Sep 15 13:00:20 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Everything has bugs. I'm sure it will be fixed soon. I believe I noticed they were in the midst of releasing a Neon release candidate, so perhaps someone did something wrong and no one has noticed it yet.
Sep 15 13:01:34 <purplex88>	i guess i will still use Eclipse Mars i downloaded last year
Sep 15 13:07:16 <purplex88>	ok found it here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/
Sep 15 13:07:41 <purplex88>	Neon 4.6 aka. Neon R
Sep 15 13:09:26 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Weird.  I haven't seen that "Neon R" convention before.  I guess the "R" stands for "Release".  I don't get the point of that.
Sep 15 13:11:42 <purplex88>	true, and 'M' in M1, M2 etc is "Milestone".
Sep 15 13:12:35 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Well, yeah, that's well known, and seeing "RC" is also pretty obvious, but it just seems silly to call it "Neon R".
Sep 15 13:13:05 <purplex88>	i guess just stick to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
Sep 15 13:13:47 <purplex88>	yep haven't seen this kind of naming before
Sep 15 13:14:24 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: When that's working.  For me, that just displays "can't open file" below the donations panel.
Sep 15 13:15:36 <purplex88>	hm, you couldn't download it?
Sep 15 13:16:36 <davidmichaelkarr>	purplex88: Not that I need to, as I already have it, but as I described, when I click that link right now, it produces a page with the "donations" panel on top of a simple "can't open file" message.  That's the entire page.
Sep 15 13:18:33 <purplex88>	strange.. didn't happen with me, i already downloaded it
Sep 15 13:37:17 <purplex88>	The dictionary now correctly works in neon.
Sep 15 13:37:31 <purplex88>	i couldn't use it at all in mars
Sep 15 13:43:36 FiSHLiM plugin unloaded

Sep 19 10:36:42 <Wallcraft>	Hi all! stupid question , how do i add libraries into WEB-INF/lib folder? If i do "Add External JARs" them will be added into Referenced Libraries folder
Sep 19 11:53:57 <mistria>	Wallcraft: did you try to copy the necessary jars to this folder?
Sep 19 11:54:03 <mistria>	Wallcraft: are you using Maven?
Sep 19 11:55:24 <Wallcraft>	i solved it but i still get some error
Sep 19 11:56:12 <Wallcraft>	mistria: im becoming fool, can you help me to configure Eclipse in the proper way to develop Java EE apps?
Sep 19 11:56:43 <mistria>	Wallcraft: well, all depends on whether you're using Maven or not
Sep 19 11:56:52 <Wallcraft>	no im not using maven
Sep 19 11:56:54 <chibby0ne>	Hey guys, so while I run an SWTBot test using maven (through the tycho-surefire-plugin) I get this weird UI which is not the normal eclipse sdk ide or the platform ide. In fact there's a message saying "!ENTRY org.eclipse.equinox.app !MESSAGE Product org.eclipse.platform.ide could not be found". I doesn't include my plugins/features, and therefore every test fails as it doesn't find the menu entries/icons that I want to test. Do you
Sep 19 11:56:55 <chibby0ne>	guys have any idea why this happens?
Sep 19 11:56:56 <mistria>	Wallcraft: using Maven would be recommended
Sep 19 11:57:38 <mistria>	Wallcraft: if you install JBoss Tools, you have some good help to get started with a Java EE project (and Maven), and good tools for the continuation of your project
Sep 19 11:57:42 <Wallcraft>	i tried to use it, but i dont understand how to use, when i installed and convert my project into maven project i get only error
Sep 19 11:58:37 <mistria>	chibby0ne: is the org.eclipse.platform.ide product available in your target-platform Tycho is using?
Sep 19 11:58:53 <Wallcraft>	Doesn't exist a sort of guide step by step for newbie that introduce to java EE developer and how to configure Eclipse too?
Sep 19 11:59:21 <mistria>	Wallcraft: there are plenty of them, however, I'm not sure which one to recommend
Sep 19 11:59:47 <chibby0ne>	So more specifically: in the <configuration> of tycho-surefire-plugin, I set the <product> to any of the commonly used products when launching but none of them are found. Funny thing is that all the test run perfectly when they are launched as junit test or swtbot test in run configuration menu.
Sep 19 11:59:50 <Wallcraft>	okay thanks anyway!
Sep 19 12:00:26 <mistria>	Wallcraft: this one is good http://developers.redhat.com/ticket-monster/ but I'm not sure it's for Java EE beginners
Sep 19 12:01:03 <mistria>	chibby0ne: that's because the necessary bundles are available in your "Run Configuration" of the IDE
Sep 19 12:01:05 <chibby0ne>	mistria, Yes, the target-definition file used in the target-platform-configuration plugin, basically contained everything from the normal update-sites (mars/neon-release, 4.5/4.6 release)
Sep 19 12:01:33 <mistria>	chibby0ne: ok...
Sep 19 12:02:21 <mistria>	chibby0ne: IIRC, Tycho doesn't automatically find which feature/bundle to add for a given productID, so you probably have to add extra-dependencies to the <configuration> of tycho-surefire-plugin to have the product included
Sep 19 12:02:47 <chibby0ne>	mistria, I'm not using target-platform anymore as I can always let tycho calculate the target-platform. Besides reading the surefire-plugin docs, it says that the OSGI runtime created doesn't contain all the plugins/features included in the target-definition
Sep 19 12:04:06 <mistria>	chibby0ne: yeah, that's fine, so I think you need to add explicitly a dependency to the bundle providing the product with https://eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-surefire/tycho-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#dependencies
Sep 19 12:04:44 <chibby0ne>	mistria, interesting.. I was doing that sort of extra-dependencies but not with the productID directly, I would just add all dependencies from the target-definition file (mainly org.eclipse.platform as eclipse-plugin)
Sep 19 12:05:35 <Wallcraft>	mistria: thanks man
Sep 19 12:06:16 <mistria>	chibby0ne: you shouldn't use the productId as an artifactId, but add explicitly the dependency to the necessary bundle
Sep 19 12:06:47 <mistria>	chibby0ne: but anyway, you should also evaluate why your tests do require a product to work
Sep 19 12:07:41 <mistria>	chibby0ne: usually, you want you code to work in multiple products, so you'd like your plugin and test to run even without a product
Sep 19 12:08:01 <chibby0ne>	mistria, ok I'll try that again more carefully.
Sep 19 12:08:21 <mistria>	chibby0ne: most projects run without the product, using the regular workbench application.
Sep 19 12:08:33 <chibby0ne>	mistria, yeah but with/without a product it just launches a weird ide :(
Sep 19 12:11:37 <chibby0ne>	mistria, actually tbh there's a branding plugin (which I'm not including in the build atm because it doesn't work) but what would be the difference in the approach if I wanted to use swtbot for rcp products? wouldn't that require the product? Also what is the testRuntime=p2Installed. I've tried this ( by using the maven-director and materializing-product goal), and pointing to the work directory to that installation but it also doesn't
Sep 19 12:11:37 <chibby0ne>	find the product :(
Sep 19 12:21:45 <Wallcraft>	mistria: i have always the same problem. When i create a Dynamic Web Project, and i create i servlet, there are many missing import such as: javax.servlet.ServletException
Sep 19 12:22:32 <Wallcraft>	for solve this i always need to import manually JARs file from tomcat9.0/lib folders, there's a way to automatically get libs from tomcat imported?
Sep 19 12:25:53 <mistria>	Wallcraft: IIRC, if you configure a server in the "Servers" view and associate it with the project, the classpath should be augmented to include the JEE jars
Sep 19 12:26:34 <mistria>	chibby0ne: did you look at the log in details, it doesn't tell anything more about not finding product?
Sep 19 12:27:59 <Wallcraft>	i created a Web Project and i associated a tomcat, but when i create servlet the servlet jars are missing
Sep 19 12:33:48 <mistria>	Wallcraft: did you look at help.eclipse.org ?
Sep 19 14:44:41 <TheMontyChrist_>	how do I get eclipse cdt to point to mingw64?
Sep 19 15:01:35 <motaka2>	cant I compile and run a single file in eclipse project using maven ?

Sep 20 10:25:45 <chibby0ne>	mistria, do you know how to get rid of these warnings when launching surefire-test "Could not resolve module: org.eclipse.compare.win32 [309]
Sep 20 10:25:46 <chibby0ne>	  Unresolved requirement: Require-Capability: eclipse.platform; filter:="(osgi.os=win32)"?
Sep 20 10:25:59 <mistria>	chibby0ne: no
Sep 20 10:26:07 <mistria>	chibby0ne: I usually ignore warning
Sep 20 10:28:03 <chibby0ne>	mistria, they seem to be caused by the inclusion of the "org.eclipse.platform" to the dependencies. A similar one also appear for macosx. Funny thing is that I'm running everything in Linux
Sep 20 10:28:51 <chibby0ne>	mistria, but yeah we can just ignore them for the time being
Sep 20 10:40:25 <maybee>	I am back, so right to your questions: 1. I am testing both. Directly starting SWTBot Tests from IDE as well as run them with tycho
Sep 20 10:40:28 <maybee>	does not matter
Sep 20 10:41:15 <maybee>	my plug-in to be tested is definitively loaded as I already triggered it. However, the error or success dialog is not shown at all
Sep 20 10:43:20 <maybee>	I even just started the test in debug mode and manually operate on the started workbench. I can do several things with my plug-in under test. However, JFace error/warning/information dialogs are not shown at all
Sep 20 11:01:15 <chibby0ne>	maybee, mmm interesting, so when NOT running the SWTBot tests the Dialogs are shown, but when using SWTBot tests  (whether through Launch Configuration as SWTBot Test or Maven/Tycho build) they are not shown?
Sep 20 11:02:35 <maybee>	that is, what I am currently observing... yes
Sep 20 11:07:39 <maybee>	I just tried it again. Normally starting a workbench with the plug-in installed yields valid MessageDialogs, but SWTBot tests do not
Sep 20 11:37:37 <mistria>	maybee: your SWTBot test need to always have focus, do you make sure you don't interfer with the test focus when it's running?
Sep 20 11:39:35 <maybee>	mistria: yes, I also do run tests where I do not do anything. not even touch mouse and keyboard. no difference
Sep 20 11:39:54 <maybee>	btw. bot.captureScreenshot also does not work. Any dependency I can miss?
Sep 20 11:56:12 <mistria>	maybee: does your test code use Display.syncExec()? Could it be stuck there?
Sep 20 12:00:56 <maybee>	mistria: not the test code does not use Display.syncExec, but the plug-in's code does. But this should not be an issue, shouldn't it?
Sep 20 12:02:21 <mistria>	maybee: no, it should not; however maybe the test do actually show an issue in the plugin's code
Sep 20 12:04:22 <maybee>	mistria: I actually just tried to debug into the JFace code and start providing different shells as a parent. Also nothing...
Sep 20 12:05:04 <maybee>	Yes, it might be an issue in the plugin's code. However, I do not know which one it could be. Until now, the plugin works fine for years (without testing) :D
Sep 20 12:05:41 <maybee>	So as I am out of ideas, I will try to dive even deeper into the mud of jface code^^
Sep 20 12:08:56 <maybee>	Found it! org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.ErrorDialog:  /** Static to prevent opening of error dialogs for automated testing. */ 	public static boolean AUTOMATED_MODE = false;
Sep 20 12:09:57 <maybee>	This flag is set to true (somewhere) and thus prevents from opening e.g. ErrorDialogs
Sep 20 12:11:29 <maybee>	mistria: So for now, I do not understand what is going on here. Is it set by SWTBot? Can I prevent the test infrastructure from setting this flag?

Sep 20 13:44:41 <quangl>	eclipse is better than netbeans?
Sep 20 13:45:04 <davidmichaelkarr>	quangl: You're going to have to answer that for yourself.
Sep 20 13:46:28 <quangl>	but i never used either
Sep 20 13:46:39 <nitind>	They're both free. So just try them.
Sep 20 13:47:44 <quangl>	ok
Sep 20 13:55:43 <mistria>	quangl: in most cases, Eclipse and NetBeans are equivalent
Sep 20 13:56:08 <mistria>	quangl: Eclipse is more feature-rich, especially if you use 3rd-party extensions from Marketplace
Sep 20 13:57:13 <mistria>	quangl: NetBeans has its advantages too, but you'll have to ask NetBeans supporter as we're all biased in favor of Eclipse here ;)
Sep 20 16:58:17 <nivag>	What's happening with Eclipse 4.6.1?
Sep 20 16:59:31 <nitind>	Still expected a week from tomorrow, AFAIK.

Sep 21 14:12:50 <Newyorkadam>	what does it mean to "switch stacks" using the eclipse debugger?
Sep 21 14:15:00 <davidmichaelkarr>	Newyorkadam: Well, I would guess that would refer to the fact that in a multi-threaded application, you could potentially be at multiple breakpoints at the same time, so you could inspect the stack at each breakpoint separately.
Sep 21 14:15:14 <Newyorkadam>	davidmichaelkarr: how would you do that?
Sep 21 14:15:50 <davidmichaelkarr>	Newyorkadam: You just click on the stack entry in the debugger frame.  You'd have to scroll up or down to find the thread that has hit a breakpoint.

Sep 21 15:22:12 <davidmichaelkarr>	soman: Best to use regexp for that.

Sep 23 14:42:54 <davidmichaelkarr>	panzon: It's generally going to be pretty hard to debug code if you don't have the source code.  However, you might be able to get some mileage out of installing "jd-eclipse", a decompiler plugin for Eclipse.  You'll have to be able to set breakpoints in the decompiled code, assuming the code hasn't been "broken" by an obfuscation system.

Sep 28 11:22:53 <zain2>	I've added the JAVA_HOME variable
Sep 28 11:24:49 <zain2_>	it worked! Thank you for your help :D
Sep 28 11:26:09 <mvvvv>	zain2_, what will you do with eclipse

Sep 28 11:26:29 <zain2_>	code java
Sep 28 11:26:50 <mvvvv>	so you'll have to install the JDK ^_^

Sep 28 11:27:46 <mvvvv>	ok so enjoy
Sep 28 11:28:09 <zain2_>	thanks :) Still waiting for installation to finish and for it to launch without errors, so fingers crossed
Sep 28 11:28:38 <mvvvv>	you don't need JAVA_HOME if you have JDK_HOME (so your jre is useless)
Sep 28 11:32:07 <zain2_>	Everything works now, so I'm afraid to change anything :p
Sep 28 11:32:09 <zain2_>	it's fine, right?
Sep 28 11:32:45 <mvvvv>	you have to keep in mind you have a JRE and a JDK installed (so 2 JRE)
Sep 28 11:42:55 <zain2_>	oh
Sep 28 11:43:06 <zain2_>	so I remove the JDE JAVA_HOME (or whatever it was) thing?
Sep 28 11:44:00 <mvvvv>	and replace with JDK_HOME
Sep 28 11:44:51 <Mooniac>	when exporting to a runnable jar, what's the difference between "exporting required libraries into ..." vs. "package required libraries into ..."
Sep 28 11:45:31 <zain2_>	I added the JDK path to the "Path" name, though
Sep 28 11:45:35 <zain2_>	I was following a guide
Sep 28 11:46:35 <mvvvv>	zain2_, I check that and I think you should keep JAVA_HOME and update it to the jdk directory
Sep 28 11:47:20 <zain2_>	so instead of JAVA_HOME going to jde it should go to jdk?
Sep 28 11:47:31 <mvvvv>	eclipse know JDK_HOME but no all the other java programs
Sep 28 11:47:43 <mvvvv>	yes
Sep 28 11:48:15 <zain2_>	ok I'll do that, thanks! :)

Sep 28 14:23:18 <metrixx>	there is a local wsdl file and also i have web service url. wsdl is hidden on service server. how can i consume this service on java via eclipse?
Sep 28 14:35:43 <frostilicus>	I've been trying to use the java search to find methods that return List<MyClass>, but no matter what I do I get results for methods that return any type of List
Sep 28 14:36:13 <frostilicus>	I've also tried the type search and limiting the locations to method return types, but I get the same problem.
Sep 28 14:36:37 <frostilicus>	It seems like all type arguments for parameterized types are ignored.

Sep 28 17:05:13 <nitind>	frostilicus: Are you doing this through the UI or from the API? If you posted http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39754974/how-to-search-for-methods-that-return-a-list-of-a-specific-class-in-eclipse , it's a little hard to tell.
Sep 28 17:05:29 <frostilicus>	through the UI
Sep 28 19:14:24 <hanshenrik_>	... for some reason, eclipse, when i press ctrl+F11 , compiles it, runs it, disregards stderr AND stdout, and just shows me what number main() returned...
Sep 28 19:14:37 <hanshenrik_>	how do i make eclipse NOT hide stdout/stderr from "console" ?
Sep 28 19:15:54 <hanshenrik_>	nvm, i think i found it ("global build console" or somthin)
Sep 28 20:10:53 <carabia>	(Eclipse CDT) Why is it that whenever I open project properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings, eclipse freezes for a minute?
Sep 28 20:10:58 <carabia>	not even exaggerating
Sep 28 20:12:42 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: platform?
Sep 28 20:24:18 <carabia>	linux
Sep 28 20:25:19 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: be more specific. Ubuntu?
Sep 28 20:28:55 <carabia>	yeah this one's based on 16.04
Sep 28 20:30:17 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: may not matter, but you should turn off gtk3 in eclipse.
Sep 28 20:31:39 <carabia>	is it a switch or disabled within eclipse?
Sep 28 20:32:13 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=turn+off+gtk3+in+eclipse
Sep 28 20:33:17 <carabia>	yeah thanks, would have taken you less time actually to spit it out than to be a smartass
Sep 28 20:35:38 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: it's simply an easy way to ensure we're talking about the same search results.
Sep 28 20:36:57 <carabia>	:D sure ha, well thanks I'll give it a shot anyway.
Sep 28 22:20:57 <carabia>	davidmichaelkarr: and I finally got the time to try it out. It actually works, thank you sir!
Sep 29 00:17:43 <nitind>	Which version of Eclipse is it? You might be better off leaving it on with the newest.
Sep 29 00:35:29 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: might be worth testing it again with your change reverted.
Sep 29 00:35:51 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: are you aware of specific gtk3 fixes?
Sep 29 00:48:04 <carabia>	nitind: this is 4.5.12
Sep 29 00:48:09 <carabia>	4.5.2*
Sep 29 00:48:35 <carabia>	davidmichaelkarr: yeah, I did. And it's just dead slow when gtk3 is enabled
Sep 29 00:52:40 <davidmichaelkarr>	carabia: ok. When you upgrade to latest (4.6.1 just today), might test toggling it again. I'm not aware of gtk3 fixes, but i'm not tracking that.

Sep 29 05:58:22 <sigdk>	Hello. I go to Preferences --> Java --> Code Style --> Formatter and I un-tick the "Empty lines" option (the last one)
Sep 29 05:59:05 <sigdk>	If I understood correctly, in this way, eclipse *will not* indent my empty lines (there will be no tabs/spaces/etc there)
Sep 29 05:59:32 <sigdk>	Yet this doesn't seem to work. Is there maybe some "conflict"? Am I doing something wrong?
Sep 29 06:28:31 <mistria>	sigdk: if you untick, those lines don't get formatted
Sep 29 06:28:42 <mistria>	sigdk: that doesn't skip auto-indentation I believe
Sep 29 06:29:40 <mistria>	sigdk: there's a setting somewhere called "remove trailing whitespaces". I believe it is what you want
Sep 29 06:30:17 <sigdk>	mistria, hmm... I'll check that, thanks
Sep 29 09:48:23 <chibby0ne>	Hey guys is anyone familiar with code coverage using cobertura?
Sep 29 09:50:41 <Zemeio>	Hi guys. I am trying to use eclipse neon and point it to a different jdk using -vm argument, and it's not working. Do you know if it is a known issue? (yes it is above -vmargs)
Sep 29 09:52:01 <Zemeio>	When I try to open the clipse it gives me an error, looking at the path pointed on my system variable, I am on windows 7.
Sep 29 09:52:27 <mvvvv>	Zemeio, do you have JAVA_HOME or JDK_HOME variable ?
Sep 29 09:55:14 <mistria>	chibby0ne: cobertura is highly deprecated, jacoco is the replacement
Sep 29 09:57:30 <chibby0ne>	mistria, I noticed that jacoco is has more active releases than cobertura... but is it really that deprecated?
Sep 29 10:01:09 <Zemeio>	mvvvv: both
Sep 29 10:01:34 <mvvvv>	does it work when your remove -vm arg ?
Sep 29 10:02:32 <Zemeio>	It gives me the same error, I don't think it is using the version specified in the vm.
Sep 29 10:04:02 <mvvvv>	what is the -vm arg ?
Sep 29 10:04:41 <Zemeio>	C:/Java8/jre/bin/server/jvm.dll
Sep 29 10:05:03 <mvvvv>	Zemeio, https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini
Sep 29 10:05:06 <Zemeio>	I tried with C:/Java8/bin/javaw.exe too
Sep 29 10:05:27 <mvvvv>	does this file exist ? the path is strange
Sep 29 10:05:34 <mvvvv>	how did you installed java ?
Sep 29 10:05:53 <Zemeio>	It is portable, the file exists and actually works
Sep 29 10:06:48 <mvvvv>	are you sure this is a windows version of java ?
Sep 29 10:07:25 <Zemeio>	Yeah, I downloaded the 32 bits exe and, extracted and ran the tools (before running the files didn't work at all)
Sep 29 10:09:07 <mvvvv>	https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html
Sep 29 10:18:18 <Zemeio>	I can't change my main java, I have to use a different one on eclipse
Sep 29 10:21:59 <mvvvv>	you have to check your java installation
Sep 29 10:49:27 <Zemeio>	K, it's working now. I don't know what it was, just copied my friend's eclipse.ini and adapted the file path to mine
Sep 29 10:49:34 <Zemeio>	Thanks for the help mvvvv
Sep 29 11:30:32 <hydrian>	Ello all
Sep 29 11:30:44 <hydrian>	I've got a plugin issue that's driving my nuts.
Sep 29 11:32:06 <hydrian>	I'm trying to remove plugin. I've removed it from the plugin directory. I've removed the configuration files from the workspace.
Sep 29 11:32:17 <hydrian>	But it still shows up as being installed.
Sep 29 11:36:04 <hydrian>	I'm tring to uninstall the plugin because I need to install an older version
Sep 29 11:36:40 <hydrian>	subclipse is the culprit.
Sep 29 11:39:53 <hydrian>	If anyone answered me, I'm missed it. (Unexpected disconnect)
Sep 29 15:34:41 <davidmichaelkarr>	One thing that I've never been able to figure out in "Search" is how to find all references to any classes in a particular package, and in all its child packages.
Sep 29 15:37:29 <davidmichaelkarr>	Hmm, never mind.  I guess i was simpler than I thought.  Search for "packagepath.*" and Types and All References.
Sep 29 15:43:51 <neilthereildeil>	can someone please help my build a large java project in eclipse?
Sep 29 15:47:01 <neilthereildeil>	i have a bunch of folder with the code organized by the package nameing convention
Sep 29 15:47:10 <neilthereildeil>	how can i import them into a buildable eclipse project?
Sep 29 15:51:21 <nitind>	copy/paste from a Finder/Explorer window? import from FileSystem?
Sep 29 15:54:02 <davidmichaelkarr>	One thing that I use a lot is hovering on a type reference to get the description of the type.  However, sometimes other "hovers" take precedence over the javadoc info, like checkstyle.  Is there a key I can press, or some action, that will let me see the javadoc info, overriding the hover precedence?
Sep 29 15:56:59 <nitind>	davidmichaelkarr: F2
Sep 29 15:57:30 <nitind>	You can also set modifiers on the Hovers preference page.
Sep 29 15:58:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: Well, no, that's not it, but I did just figure it out. That only gives the tooltip window keyboard focus. I found the hovers prefs page which shows the modifiers.  I thought it was something like that, but I didn't know which ones did what.  I found what modifier javadoc is set to, and I see that that works.
Sep 29 15:59:01 <davidmichaelkarr>	Amazing how asking questions here makes me figure it out 5 seconds later. :)
Sep 29 16:04:27 <nitind>	And what you can learn by trying to figure out how to answer the questions you don't already know how to answer.
Sep 29 16:15:02 <Infested1>	hello, i need to do a project in prolog, and i would like to do the gui in java. does eclipse support prolog in java or anything of the sort?
Sep 29 16:18:29 <davidmichaelkarr>	Infested1: you might just build a plain java gui and execute your prolog interpreter from it.
Sep 29 16:19:58 <Infested1>	well its a game, all the rules and checking moves are valid and stuff like that should happen in prolog. the gui part is just for ease of use and game management (like whos turn it is and calling the right methods)
Sep 29 16:24:39 <Infested1>	davidmichaelkarr: forgot to notify
Sep 29 16:26:29 <davidmichaelkarr>	Infested1: doesn't change my answer.
Sep 29 16:27:18 <Maxel>	not sure if this is an eclipse question: I have eclipse with weblogic server. I am trying to set up weblogic and when I add my username/password credentials and hit test, it says successful, but then as soon as I hit ok, the message next to the server says user authentication failed
Sep 29 16:28:59 <Infested1>	ok then i dont understand your answer. how do i execute my prolog interpreter from it, and get an answer back (and maybe send it info), and how do i keep the prolog's knowledge of the game alive?
Sep 29 17:28:48 <nitind>	Maxel: What does "set up weblogic" mean, and is that related to Eclipse somehow?
Sep 29 17:32:25 <davidmichaelkarr>	Infested1: you can run other executables from java. You can pass it input and read output.
Sep 30 07:37:59 <chibby0ne>	Hey guys is anyone familiar with code coverage using Jacoco? My problem is that the report lists the class analyzed as test class and not the Class under Test.
Sep 30 07:42:41 <chibby0ne>	is there any eclipse project that uses jacoco?
Sep 30 07:47:24 <mvvvv>	chibby0ne, computer says yes !
Sep 30 07:52:11 <chibby0ne>	oh forgot to mention: this is related to using Jacoco in maven builds. Not the Eclipse Plugin Eclmma
Sep 30 07:53:01 <mvvvv>	computer says yes
Sep 30 07:55:05 <chibby0ne>	mvvvv, ?
Sep 30 07:55:44 <mvvvv>	google : eclipse maven jacoco  --> http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html
Sep 30 08:06:17 <chibby0ne>	mvvvv, funny. I did that... it doesn't explain how to use jacoco to create coverage reports of eclipse-plugin from eclipse-test-plugin does it?
Sep 30 08:09:03 <mvvvv>	not funny I didn't understood your question. so you want to test your eclipse-plugin using jacoco
Sep 30 08:11:04 <chibby0ne>	mvvvv, computer says yes !
Sep 30 08:12:55 <chibby0ne>	mvvvv, just in case: yes that's what I meant: produce test coverage of an eclipse-plugin
Sep 30 08:18:49 <mvvvv>	So you can do that from eclipse launch configurations : http://www.eclemma.org/userdoc/launching.html and you want to do that from maven
Sep 30 08:22:23 <chibby0ne>	mvvvv, yeah exactly
Sep 30 08:24:34 <mvvvv>	something like that : https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/977961/
Sep 30 08:32:40 <chibby0ne>	mvvvv, not really. I'm not using RCPTT. I'm doing unit tests at the moment, but I also have SWTBot tests that I would like to add to the coverage report.
Sep 30 08:34:20 <mistria>	chibby0ne: Eclipse Platform and SWTBot do have code coverage produced by Jacoco and reported to Sonar
Sep 30 08:35:22 <mvvvv>	mistria, with RCPTT ...
Sep 30 08:35:25 <mistria>	chibby0ne: just noticed that SWTBot seems to have the same problem as you have
Sep 30 08:35:36 <mistria>	mvvvv: no
Sep 30 08:37:00 <mistria>	chibby0ne: see https://dev.eclipse.org/sonar/drilldown/measures/33441?metric=coverage for example
Sep 30 08:37:46 <mistria>	chibby0ne: however, Sonar does all the magic, all we did is provide it a nice jacoco.exec to report
Sep 30 08:40:30 <mistria>	chibby0ne: and here is the job configuration: https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.resources-SonarQube/
Sep 30 08:46:45 <chibby0ne>	mistria, ok this is definitively helpful! Thanks mistria!!
Sep 30 08:47:17 <chibby0ne>	mistria, what I did notice is that they're not using jacoco report goal... they just use "prepare-agent"
Sep 30 08:47:41 <mistria>	chibby0ne: yes, Sonar does the report
Sep 30 08:48:16 <mistria>	chibby0ne: it's easier to install Sonar  and let it work than to try to automate report creation via Maven
Sep 30 08:48:32 <mistria>	chibby0ne: moreover, it looks nicer and is easier to browse
Sep 30 08:49:13 <mistria>	chibby0ne: if you interest in code coverage and other quality indicators, using SonarQube is worth it
Sep 30 08:49:22 <mistria>	chibby0ne: especially since it's free ;)
Sep 30 08:49:58 <chibby0ne>	mistria, it does look much prettier, but I was hoping at some point to show the code coverage stats from jenkins itself (using the jacoco jenkins plugin)
Sep 30 08:50:26 <mistria>	chibby0ne: ok, I never tried it
Sep 30 08:51:33 <chibby0ne>	mistria, just checked; there's also a sonarcube jenkins plugin...
Sep 30 08:54:36 <mistria>	chibby0ne: yes, Platform uses it. Hudson/Jenkins runs build (which generate the jacoco.exec) and then invoke the SonarQube plugin (which triggers analysis and report)
Sep 30 08:54:54 <mistria>	chibby0ne: it's a post-build step like JUnit reports
Sep 30 08:57:37 <mizhka>	hi! it will be nice to see new OS support (*bsd), but what should be done for it? actually port of Eclipse exists for a long time, actual version is 4.6.0. there is also bugzilla ticket...
Sep 30 09:02:26 <chibby0ne>	mistria, I see! interesting approach indeed!
Sep 30 09:22:17 <chibby0ne>	mistria, checking the poms from the build.. I don't see any configuration of jacoco plugin
Sep 30 09:24:24 <mistria>	chibby0ne: it's http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator.git/tree/eclipse-platform-parent/pom.xml#n1013 . The jacoco.destFile property is set to an absolutePath in the hudson job and passed to the SonarQube Hudson plugoin
Sep 30 09:26:21 <chibby0ne>	mistria, oh ok I just went and cloned eclipse.platform.resources because that's what the build showed, but yeah this is the parent of all the platform subprojects right?
Sep 30 09:55:08 <chibby0ne>	mistria, mmm I just noticed I still have the same problem of having the stats for the test itself and not the plugin...
Sep 30 10:55:04 <Gamoder_>	Hi everyone, how can I ensure some classes are available in the runtime for some plugin project? I always get some NoClassDefFoundError for classes which I think should be on the classpath
Sep 30 16:11:48 <dmiles>	Import Software From an Existing Isntallation is very very awesome
Sep 30 16:12:06 <dmiles>	i wonder how long that has been there?
Sep 30 16:17:01 <dmiles>	aha 2.7 (2012) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11438529/easy-way-to-copy-old-plugins-into-new-install-of-eclipse

Oct 03 12:31:46 <donald1>	hello. I want to test a program in java with eclipse. I installed eclipse 3.8.1 in linux. I can not find the debugger button. I can use right click and debbug but I lost a terrible number of elementarytools like make a new project or else. I want to get the same  configuration as eclipse as this tutorial https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-java/installer-les-outils-de-developpement. The top buttons are differe
Oct 03 12:38:03 <Slartibart>	mpiggott: Sorry for my late answer. Are you saying that the color is(might be) coming from outside of eclipse? Like system colors? No hope of anything in eclipse that can override it? Sure, the tricky part here is probably to *find* the setting that does this :-|..
Oct 03 12:44:51 <mvvvv>	donald1, I guess you installed eclipse 3.8 because of ubuntu or debian package ? bad idea.
Oct 03 13:33:07 <donald1>	mvvvv: what is the best pratice?
Oct 03 14:03:29 <nitind>	donald1: Depending on the distribution, the Eclipse Java Development Tools might be in a separate package like "eclipse-jdt", not just "eclipse".
Oct 03 14:04:00 <nitind>	donald1: Alternately, you can get the latest release from download.eclipse.org, untar it somewhere under your home directory, and then just run it.

Oct 03 15:07:50 <nitind>	It should only be for one time with that file.
Oct 03 15:08:10 <nitind>	Did you mean Open With...->XML Editor?
Oct 03 15:10:37 <nitind>	Every time you open a file from your workspace, the editor you chose becomes the default editor for the next time you open that file. So if you've worked with a file before, installing something new doesn't hijack the defaults for that file.
Oct 03 15:20:28 <donald1>	nitind: I am on jessie. I have a great wish to install it with apt-get to do easier update.
Oct 03 16:13:41 <nitind>	donald1: Well then enjoy the 4 year old version that's in their latest stable.
Oct 03 16:20:30 <metrixx>	nitind, thank you
Oct 03 16:20:35 <metrixx>	sorry i was away
Oct 03 16:22:36 <donald1>	nitind: what ??? eclipse si not empackaged for debian ???
Oct 03 16:23:53 <nitind>	donald1: Debian stable packages a 4 year old release.

Oct 04 10:55:35 <donald1>	hello I met some trouble to use eclipse with apt-get install. Do you have any idea to install the latest version?
Oct 04 11:08:03 <mvvvv>	donald1, do not use apt to install eclipse. old version to forget (3.8)
Oct 04 11:08:23 <mvvvv>	4.6 neon can be installed using eclipse-installer on the site
Oct 04 11:09:22 <mvvvv>	https://eclipse.org/downloads/
Oct 04 11:16:53 <nitind>	Alternately, it's sometimes still simpler to download the 4.6.1 packages directly from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/ .
Oct 04 11:27:27 <donald1>	thank you
Oct 04 11:54:02 <donald1>	mvvvv: I configured my debian to accept only to install free softwares and deny any package with different licenses. How to keep this effect if I do not use apt-get?
Oct 04 11:57:28 <mvvvv>	donald1, an effect ?
Oct 04 11:58:09 <donald1>	how can I be sure there is not any non-free software?
Oct 04 11:58:55 <mvvvv>	The licence aggrement when installing an eclipse plugin
Oct 04 11:59:15 <mvvvv>	what about the plugins in your web browser ?
Oct 04 12:00:57 <donald1>	I have not installed ay plug-in
Oct 04 12:01:49 <mvvvv>	you're a kind of extremist so
Oct 04 12:02:10 <donald1>	yet
Oct 04 12:02:14 <davidmichaelkarr>	donald1: There is "free software", and there is software with restricted licenses.  If you only allow free software, it's pretty simple.  If you can get it from the repo without paying for it, then it's free. :)
Oct 04 12:03:28 <davidmichaelkarr>	donald1: If the issue is restricted licenses, then you might address this on the eclipse forums.
Oct 04 12:03:36 <donald1>	"apt-get install eclipse" = get fro the repo and manual install = search on internet?
Oct 04 12:11:48 <mvvvv>	donald1, apt works if Debian compiles the whole product. They stopped long time ago
Oct 04 12:13:25 <nitind>	It's licensed under an OSI-approved license, the EPL, which is the successor to the license it's under in the Debian packages. Read it at https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/epl-v10.php . http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/epl discusses it. If you were OK getting it from apt, you should be ok with getting it directly from upstream.
Oct 04 12:49:50 <Anticom>	Hi all. I'm having issues with debugging a cross-compiled binary with eclipse CDT. Gdb is complaining about not being able to find libraries. I've googled arround a bit and in the warning gdb also suggests using 'set sysroot'
Oct 04 12:49:56 <Anticom>	Now i'm wondering, how to do this in eclipse
Oct 04 12:50:20 <Anticom>	I mean i could just go ahead and add all the libs using the project's properties but this has some obvious disadvantages

Oct 05 16:26:51 <tokam>	so the interrupt occurs inside a routine, which blocks my gui of the operating system (on Ubuntu)
Oct 05 16:27:02 <tokam>	by gui I mean, I can not anymore interact with xorg
Oct 05 16:27:05 <tokam>	and this gets on my nerves
Oct 05 16:27:11 <tokam>	I must go to the terminal and kill java
Oct 05 16:45:37 <nitind>	So you're debugging Java code that's calling into native code that's talking to the X server, possibly during event processing?

Oct 06 14:40:07 <nitind>	You've modified your Formatter preference page values?
Oct 06 15:05:44 <Xgc>	Running into an odd egit problem, where 2 branches show a difference (compare with each other), but merging one branch into the other has no impact.  This may be expected due to a revert.  But the behavior seems to differ from github enterprise merge, which is able to resolve the difference.
Oct 06 15:07:59 <nitind>	viro: You need to set the Formatter preferences to match and enable formatting as part of the automatic Save Actions, assuming you're talking about Java.

Oct 06 17:41:49 <davidmichaelkarr>	noncom: Could be.
Oct 06 17:42:55 <noncom>	well.. I am trying to create a very simple eclipse maven project, and I specify the dependency in the pom, and it downloads all and ok, no errors, but then
Oct 06 17:43:22 <noncom>	the library itself is not listed among Maven Dependencies, although every dependency of that library is there
Oct 06 17:43:30 <noncom>	as the result, my program does not see the dep
Oct 06 17:43:43 <noncom>	if I manually add the lib to the build path, it works
Oct 06 17:43:49 <noncom>	but hey, what's wrong with maven?
Oct 06 17:44:00 <davidmichaelkarr>	noncom: Have to see the actual POM.
Oct 06 17:44:10 <noncom>	wait a sec
Oct 06 17:44:28 <davidmichaelkarr>	noncom: Although I might guess you're using "dependencyManagement" when you should be using "dependencies".
Oct 06 17:44:46 <noncom>	the "effective pom" or just "pom" ?
Oct 06 17:44:59 <davidmichaelkarr>	noncom: Former would be fine.
Oct 06 17:45:52 <noncom>	http://pastebin.com/bZUwn4tr
Oct 06 17:46:17 <noncom>	the troubled lib is https://bintray.com/jmonkeyengine/org.jmonkeyengine/jme3-lwjgl
Oct 06 17:47:12 <noncom>	the program even starts to run, but crashes later with "class not found"
Oct 06 17:48:20 <davidmichaelkarr>	noncom: By being a "pom" dependency, it doesn't represent a dependency by itself, but it will pull in any non-pom dependencies of itself. I'm guessing you need to remove that line.
Oct 06 17:48:37 <davidmichaelkarr>	noncom: The "type" property, that is.

Oct 06 22:31:10 <Frigid_Cryotank>	In https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497188  there is a comment from a Patrik Suzzi about solving a problem with Eclipse and a version mismatch with GTK.
Oct 06 22:32:08 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I'm running Slackware Linux 14.1 and the solution seems straightforward: download GTK3, gstreamer, and it's dependencies, compile and install and that should do it.
Oct 06 22:33:09 <Frigid_Cryotank>	But it's not.  GTK3 fails because it can't find its dependencies that were just installed.
Oct 06 22:34:12 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I might be in the wrong chat area... but could someone give me a ..hint.. as how to get everything properly installed for Eclipse?  It would be nice to have the SWT Browser popup working properly.

Oct 07 12:34:16 <davidmichaelkarr>	metrixx: Would need to see details of your pom.

Oct 07 12:48:32 <Zemeio>	nitind: I found an error saying that the host could not be resolved. Do you know how I download it and tell it to install from my local files?
Oct 07 12:48:42 <Zemeio>	I can't get the proxy to work
Oct 07 12:51:19 <nitind>	Zemeio: Not unless they provide a download
Oct 07 12:56:42 <Zemeio>	nitind: is the update side I sent enough? Thank a lot for the help

Oct 08 15:50:08 <a101755>	i want to debug javascript in my eclipse-installation
Oct 08 15:50:18 <a101755>	so i've install jsdt
Oct 08 15:51:07 <a101755>	is it right, that i can debug remote with chrome
Oct 08 15:51:24 <a101755>	?
Oct 08 15:52:09 <a101755>	i've found a description on youtube
Oct 08 15:52:50 <a101755>	but there is described the configuration with chrome-dev-tools and this project is broken

Oct 08 18:15:14 <budder>	anyone here
Oct 08 19:32:39 <noncom>	once I have made an operation to go to background, how do I return it?
Oct 08 19:32:53 <noncom>	I always accidentally press that "in background" button
Oct 08 19:33:03 <noncom>	but never able to get them back unless I reinstall the IDE
Oct 08 19:40:57 <davidmichaelkarr>	noncom: you can always open the progress view to see their progress.
Oct 08 19:45:40 <noncom>	davidmichaelkarr: yeah... but... do I ever get them back to the popup representation?

Oct 09 18:19:46 <hanshenrik>	infinite loop that freezes eclipse
Oct 09 18:20:07 <hanshenrik>	other filenames works just fine
Oct 09 18:22:38 <hanshenrik>	it might be related that eclipse refuses to save that filename to the project file, whenever i terminate and restart eclipse, i have to F5-refresh the working dir for eclipse to know its there
Oct 09 18:24:47 <hanshenrik>	whoa, no, it's not the filename that's the issue... its that exact text :o
Oct 09 18:25:20 <hanshenrik>	i have "on save: format", but when i ask it to format manually, it formats it.. but when i try to save that exact code, it enters 100% cpu eating loop...
Oct 09 18:28:05 <hanshenrik>	can someone else with php-neon try to save this text to a file? http://paste.debian.net/plain/859875

Oct 09 18:32:51 <hanshenrik>	remember that next time you visit wikipedia or facebook
Oct 09 18:33:19 <TheChubu>	thats js/html. if i dont see the PHP, its as if it wasnt there.

Oct 10 06:00:45 <Gamoder_>	Hi everyone, I am using Eclipse Mars and I got now the problem that "infer generic type arguments" did not return me a result at all while I could manually write something accepted by the compiler. Is it known that this function only works in some scenarios?
Oct 10 11:39:30 <blonewolfs>	is it possible to close a project from the command line in 4.5?
Oct 10 12:55:29 <Gamoder_>	If I have an eclipse application (plugin) running, System.out.println does not show anything any more in my console view. Is there a way around it?
Oct 10 13:16:52 <nitind_>	Gamoder_: Did you launch with -consoleLog?
Oct 10 13:20:46 <Gamoder_>	nitind_: yes
Oct 10 18:36:26 <hanshenrik__>	isn't there a "eclipse for python" ?
Oct 10 18:39:03 <jeen>	hanshenrik__ , yes, it's called PyDev
Oct 10 18:40:27 <hanshenrik__>	thanks. know why it's not listed in the "eclipse installer" as an option?
Oct 10 18:40:32 <hanshenrik__>	.. whilst things like PHP are
Oct 10 18:41:30 <jeen>	hanshenrik__ probably because it's developed by an entity other than the Eclipse Foundation.
Oct 10 18:42:51 <hanshenrik__>	and i thought the php thing was too, developed by Zend, wasn't it?
Oct 10 18:43:35 <hanshenrik__>	oh, apparently not
Oct 10 18:43:42 <jeen>	I don't know for sure but I think Zend actually contributed their code to Eclipse
Oct 10 19:06:16 <hanshenrik__>	oh kk
Oct 10 19:56:19 <hanshenrik__>	weird shit, i have a specific combination of a filename and code that makes eclipse run at 100% cpu eating loop in a specific configuration
Oct 10 19:56:34 <hanshenrik__>	if i significantly alter the code, or if i change the filename of the code, it works fine
Oct 10 19:57:06 <hanshenrik__>	(frozen 100% cpu eating infinite loop, by the looks of it)
Oct 10 19:57:14 <Castor_>	what are you guys favorite source code repository for java+eclipse?
Oct 10 20:16:37 <hanshenrik__>	haha i tracked it down to: it only happens with the Dark theme
Oct 10 20:17:32 <hanshenrik__>	(that took a while, cus that was the last thing i expecte x.x)
Oct 10 20:37:10 <jeen>	Castor_  depends on the project. for open source stuff github is pretty much unbeatable.
Oct 11 00:54:51 <hamsterpower>	hi I have Eclipse neon but only for java. I want to get c++ one as well. What do I put in the "Work with" section in Help -> Install new software ?
Oct 11 00:56:36 <hamsterpower>	I think I found it but not sure :  http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/9.0
Oct 11 00:56:39 <hamsterpower>	it doesn't say neon
Oct 11 00:58:01 <hamsterpower>	I did it :)
Oct 11 00:58:20 <hamsterpower>	I personally think they should have kept the naming convention but w/e
Oct 11 14:31:41 <jmspeex>	Eclipse Neon keeps getting stuck into an infinite build loop when I enable build on save. Anyone can help?
Oct 11 14:42:11 <nitind_>	jmspeex: You mean enabling Automatic builds from the Project menu, or something else?
Oct 11 14:47:42 <jmspeex>	nitind_: I mean "Build on resource save"
Oct 11 14:48:27 <jmspeex>	as soon as I enable that, it just builds forever
Oct 11 14:48:46 <nitind_>	I don't know where that is in the UI.
Oct 11 14:48:51 <nitind_>	What's building?
Oct 11 14:49:11 <jmspeex>	Project->Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Behaviour
Oct 11 14:49:37 <jmspeex>	In any case, I found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30278885/infinite-rebuild-loop-in-eclipse-cdt
Oct 11 14:50:15 <jmspeex>	and disabling "CDT GCC Build Output Parser" seems to fix the problem, although I've no idea what that option is or whether it has any side effects

Oct 11 17:16:30 <davidmichaelkarr>	nikhilmudholkar: Best approach is simply to get involved with a project you're interested in. Pointless to try to find something "easy". That strategy will fail.
Oct 11 17:17:23 <davidmichaelkarr>	nikhilmudholkar: Almost every project needs help with writing documentation.
Oct 11 17:17:37 <nikhilmudholkar>	ok. But i am new to all this open source thing. I have doubts will i be able to do it.

Oct 11 17:22:56 <nikhilmudholkar>	i have made my account on eclipse but i guess i will have to wait for few days till my account gets moderated. No other option other than waiting
Oct 11 17:29:04 <jeen>	nikhilmudholkar most projects have some guidelines to getting started as an open source developer, and in my experience most will be happy to talk you through the basics. It gets them a free pair of extra hands, after all :)
Oct 11 17:29:56 <nikhilmudholkar>	thanks jeen. Can you tell me where can i find such projects?
Oct 11 17:31:14 <jeen>	er well, projects.eclipse.org would be a good place to start. But as davidmichaelkarr said above: best approach is get involved with a project that you're already interested in (e.g. one that you're already using).

Oct 13 13:40:46 <KimHansen>	I just spend half a day figuring out why my maven build was unstable before I realized that I still had Eclipse and auto-build running. Is there something I can do to the pom file or eclipse such that this will not happen to me again?
Oct 13 13:45:20 <nitind_>	Install m2e and make sure the project is recognized as one that's built by Maven?
Oct 13 13:48:43 <KimHansen>	nitind_: I think that I have m2e installed, my problem is that I sometimes want to build using the commandline, e.g. while I am building a release
Oct 13 13:49:37 <davidmichaelkarr>	KimHansen: I guess I would ask why this is causing a problem.
Oct 13 13:51:54 <KimHansen>	When building with from the command line I set the version as property that got put into a version.properties file. Half the time that file got build by eclipse and didn't get the correct value
Oct 13 13:53:06 <KimHansen>	Running the build 10 times in a row and getting two different results was really strange until I figured out what was happening
Oct 13 13:56:00 <davidmichaelkarr>	KimHansen: Haven't had to deal with that particular problem. I wonder if defining a profile that contains the version value you're currently using would be a practical mitigating strategy. You could set that by default in eclipse, but either use it or not use it from the command line.
Oct 13 13:58:33 <KimHansen>	It was totally my fault that I was building in the same target dir from two places at once, but I was just wondering if it was possible to put something into the pom file that would make one of the builds fail.
Oct 13 14:04:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	KimHansen: Sounds like a pure maven question.
Oct 13 14:07:04 <KimHansen>	I need maven to detect Eclipse auto-building. If I were to write the maven plugin myself or some other program that should detect that Eclipse was auto-building, then how could my program detect it?
Oct 13 14:08:39 <davidmichaelkarr>	KimHansen: Don't you just want to fail if the property isn't set?  That's a maven question.
Oct 13 14:09:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	KimHansen: You can also just turn off "build automatically" in Eclipse.
Oct 13 14:12:08 <KimHansen>	davidmichaelkarr: I don't want to fail on the missing property as that only masks the issue, it doesn't solve it. I remember that I some years ago has the same problem with Ant and Eclipse where the resulting jar files had broken class files in some cases.
Oct 13 14:13:19 <KimHansen>	We ended up defining two different build dirs because half my team kept making that mistake, but now the build dir in Eclipse is taken from the pom file
Oct 13 14:14:58 <KimHansen>	I know that I could turn of auto build, did that half a year ago because of this issue, but now I wrote some new code where the auto build really helped in speeding up my testing and then I got the problem when I released.
Oct 13 14:15:30 <KimHansen>	I am just trying to figure out if there is a way to have my cake and eat it too
Oct 13 14:16:24 <davidmichaelkarr>	KimHansen: i believe profiles could do that, as i said earlier.
Oct 13 14:18:33 <KimHansen>	But then I would still be building from Eclipse and command line at the same time. Is that safe now? I have seen it create broken class files some years ago
Oct 13 14:19:47 <KimHansen>	I would rather have a way to detect the "collision" and then bail out
Oct 13 14:31:12 <davidmichaelkarr>	KimHansen: No clue what you're talking about.  As should be obvious from the fact that you're trying to turn off the default, numerous people build automatically in Eclipse with no problems.
Oct 13 15:35:02 <alex1a>	any option to minimize/maximizeand all (+) and (-) buttons on right of line number ?

Oct 14 08:34:58 <pombreda>	this looks like a recent behavior. Was not this way in the past
Oct 14 08:36:10 <pombreda>	RcDABO, there surely are ways to finick with this, but for sanity your best option is to use clean non-clashing namespaces
Oct 14 08:36:44 <RcDABO>	pombreda: the problem is that due to the nature of the projects i can't do that
Oct 14 08:58:32 *	pombreda entered https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=505980 
Oct 14 09:00:26 <pombreda>	RcDABO, afairc there may be ways by playing with your manifest settings. or possibly with fragments. you will have to read the docs. if do not control either A and B that may be difficult though
Oct 14 09:01:24 <RcDABO>	pombreda: thanks, I have been reading about fragments already and that's what I need
Oct 14 10:40:07 <nitind_>	RcDABO: Sounds more like you need to declare them a "split packages" https://nirmalsasidharan.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/split-packages-an-osgi-nightmare/ .
Oct 14 12:04:21 <jssjr>	i am running latest neon and egit plugins on macos sierra. after supplying the URL and creds to "import from git", i'm asked to select the branches i want to fetch. however this list is empty so I cannot proceed. where would I look to find debug info on what is happening?
Oct 14 12:05:17 <jssjr>	i suspect something is mangling the git request to github. i am using https, with my username (jssjr) and a personal access token as the password since i have 2fa enabled
Oct 14 12:06:50 <jssjr>	fwiw, i can clone from the command line and import the local git repo just fine
Oct 14 12:14:36 <jssjr>	also, it doesn't matter if i'm attempting to import from a public or private repo. so i believe that rules out auth problems
Oct 14 12:15:24 <davidmichaelkarr>	jssjr: If you can't find an answer here, post to the egit eclipse forum, with all details.
Oct 14 12:15:49 <jssjr>	davidmichaelkarr: will do. i already reviewed relevant topics there without any luck
Oct 14 12:16:29 <davidmichaelkarr>	jssjr: Any surprises in eclipse log?
Oct 14 12:16:32 <jssjr>	is there a way to get more verbose logging from eclipse? this is probably something simple but i'm poking at it blindly
Oct 14 12:17:27 <jssjr>	ahh. it's in the error log =)
Oct 14 12:17:30 <jssjr>	org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Failed to execute runnable (java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Repository config file /tmp/config invalid Cannot read file /tmp/config)
Oct 14 12:22:51 <jssjr>	well, that is just terrible. i had a file in /tmp called config that was owned by another user. apparently the egit plugin expects to be able to use that path for something...
Oct 14 12:23:08 <jssjr>	renaming the local /tmp/config resolved the problem
Oct 14 12:23:39 <jssjr>	thats a dangerous assumption about paths for the code to make
Oct 14 12:40:43 <jssjr>	which appears to be buried deep inside of jgit, beyond my ability to determine where the problem actually exists :(
Oct 14 13:16:25 <WereCatf>	I'm new to Eclipse and I was wondering if there's any setting buried somewhere to make the cursor follow mouse right-click in editor-view? At the moment the cursor stays where it is, regardless of where I right-click, and that's freaking annoying.
Oct 14 13:38:47 <mvdk>	Hi! I just installed eclipse for java on linux. The Package Explorer used to show only my projects, but now it shows JDT UI Examples, JDT UI Tests, JDT Debpg Tests, JDT Core Tests, JDT Binaries, JDT UI, and more..... Why does it show all these in the package explorer?
Oct 14 13:40:04 <mvdk>	The project explorer is is filled up with org.eclipse.jdt.{-feature,annotation,apt.core,apt.pluggable.core,...}, and maaaany others
Oct 14 13:44:19 <davidmichaelkarr>	mvdk: Where did you get the installer?
Oct 14 13:46:20 <mvdk>	from here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/?osType=linux
Oct 14 13:46:24 <mvdk>	I chose Eclipse Neon
Oct 14 13:47:07 <mvdk>	and in the installer I only chose "JDT", but maybe that was wrong... hmm
Oct 14 13:48:28 <mvdk>	It also took forever to install, it couldn't resolve the files from some german mirror.. it kept switching between trying two different files.
Oct 14 13:48:36 <davidmichaelkarr>	mvdk: I don't see a "JDT" selection anywhere.  Do you just mean the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"?
Oct 14 13:49:04 <mvdk>	Yes, that one
Oct 14 13:49:23 <davidmichaelkarr>	mvdk: No clue.
Oct 14 13:49:37 <mvdk>	hmmmm but now I'm re-running the installer to see what I did... I see that I chose JDT in the next step in the wizard, "Projects - Check the projects you want to provision"
Oct 14 13:49:59 <mvdk>	Maybe I need to uncheck everything there... I dunno, I just assumed I needed jdt
Oct 14 13:51:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	mvdk: No idea how you got to that.
Oct 14 13:51:50 <mvdk>	It creates a workspace in ~/opt/eclipse/jdt-master/ws
Oct 14 13:52:03 <mvdk>	And in there, it has a hidden folder with all the jdt stuff
Oct 14 13:53:42 <mvdk>	ok, now I wiped everything and reinstalled without the JDT option... it's clean now.
Oct 14 13:56:32 <mvdk>	Aaaaaaah. Now, even Eclipse Marketplace is showing. It wasn't showing when I had installed the plain eclipse (not "for Java development"). Strange.
Oct 14 13:57:27 <tokam>	Is there a hotKey to transform camelCase notation to the FINAL_CONSTANT_NOTATION ?
Oct 14 14:00:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	tokam: custom text manipulations like that is why i have Emacs in my toolbox.
Oct 14 14:01:09 <tokam>	I have no good 60 minute experience with it
Oct 14 18:02:19 <metrixx_>	hi girls
Oct 14 18:02:29 <metrixx_>	i have a web dynamic project on eclipse neon
Oct 14 18:02:47 <metrixx_>	i used jersey for a rest service and i need to deploy this project on weblogic sever
Oct 14 18:02:58 <metrixx_>	but the problem is.. this weblogic server version is some old
Oct 14 18:03:15 <metrixx_>	it doesn't accept java ee web module version 3.1
Oct 14 18:03:20 <metrixx_>	how can i downgrade this?

Oct 17 12:40:47 *	Channel #eclipse url: http://eclipse.org
Oct 17 15:18:10 <ke4nhw>	Anyone else aware of a problem with Eclipse Neon 4.6.1 where it is not connecting to the Internet at all? Will not install new software or even run its own Check for Updates
Oct 17 15:18:39 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: Are you behind a proxy?  Have to set that in preferences.
Oct 17 15:19:02 <ke4nhw>	No, not behind a proxy, all my networking checks out
Oct 17 15:19:21 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: Then check eclipse log for related error messages.
Oct 17 15:20:15 <ke4nhw>	When I run Updates I get 3 Transport Initialization Error
Oct 17 15:21:50 <ke4nhw>	Not familiar with where the hard log is located but that's what I'm getting during the update attempt
Oct 17 15:23:20 <davidmichaelkarr>	You can get to it two ways: From the shell, go to your workspace folder and open ".metadata/.log".  Also, "Help"->"Installation Details"->"Configuration"->"View Error Log".
Oct 17 15:25:52 <ke4nhw>	I'm trying something else here. I downloaded 4.6.1 and simply copied over 4.5.2, might be problems with that. Oh, and yes, I also, as a precaution, copied it to its own separate directory, and everything works fine.
Oct 17 15:26:01 <ke4nhw>	Problem is how I copied it.
Oct 17 15:26:30 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: "simply copied over 4.5.2"? I don't know what that means.
Oct 17 15:27:11 <ke4nhw>	I had 4.5.2 in the \eclipse folder, I extracted the 4.6.1 zip into that folder as well, overwriting 4.5.2
Oct 17 15:27:13 <ke4nhw>	bad move
Oct 17 15:27:22 <ke4nhw>	one I just found a remedy for.
Oct 17 15:29:00 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: You didn't perhaps open a workspace in 4.6.1 that you originally created with 4.5.2, or some earlier version, did you?
Oct 17 15:39:50 <ke4nhw>	Yes, but it wasn't a critical one. I know it's lost but it's one I just created for this purpose so I literally only lost a blank JFrame
Oct 17 15:40:28 <ke4nhw>	And it was created in 4.5.2
Oct 17 15:45:06 <ke4nhw>	Okay, update runs, gotta get everything else installed. Only two things: WindowBuilder Pro and e(fx)clipse... I tried the update site for WindowBuilder Pro it's not working, should I be using the Integrated link?
Oct 17 15:49:24 <ke4nhw>	Okay on game for that one as well, I've got fumble fingers today
Oct 17 15:52:40 <nitind_>	Yes, there could be problems with copying a new version over an older one. It's usually not recommended.
Oct 17 15:55:04 <ke4nhw>	Yep, learned that the hard way, no problem though, I extracted a clean version and have it up and running now
Oct 17 15:55:51 <ke4nhw>	Deleted the corrupted version. If I decide I need 4.5.2 for some reason I can always download and extract it to its own directory
Oct 17 15:56:31 <ke4nhw>	I'll just label workspaces from now on: 452ThisProgram or 461ThatProgram
Oct 17 15:57:07 <ke4nhw>	But since I am just a beginner level when it comes to Java and especially the GUI's in Java then no harm done
Oct 17 15:57:41 <ke4nhw>	I haven't lost anything earth-shattering. No worries, our government or economy will not collapse as a result of this screwup...
Oct 17 16:05:34 <ke4nhw>	Now to get this one figured out. It's asking for an absolute path to Scene Builder.
Oct 17 16:16:32 <ke4nhw>	yea I'm thinking Scene Builder can't be so good as to warrant this pain in the rump. I've got to locate the source, locate the cross build prerequisites, then build it for Windows. Starting to sound like more pain than it's worth. Since I'm not building animated or extravagant interfaces Swing may be plenty enough...
Oct 17 16:24:16 <ke4nhw>	Yea bump this unless someone has a better solution available... Or unless someone can tell me that Scene Builder is really so awesome as to be worth all this work... One benefit would be the ability to work across multiple monitors so I can have my toolboxes on one monitor, my design layout on one, my output and errors on another, etc...
Oct 17 16:24:31 <ke4nhw>	Something that, at least in 4.5.2, I didn't have...
Oct 17 22:23:16 <regice202>	hello!
Oct 17 22:23:31 <regice202>	I have a question about Javadocs.
Oct 17 22:24:05 <regice202>	I have the proper URL for the docs and when I click the little icon to open the appropriate javadoc locations it works
Oct 17 22:24:17 <regice202>	but the tool tip isn't showing the doc info
Oct 18 05:02:54 <Lachezar>	Hey all. I've got about a dozen of Eclipse installations (various versions and added extra/3P features: Spring, Android, Go, GWT, etc.) with about a dozen workspaces and a dozen various J2EE servers installed. I can't put everything in one place (some features don't mix well). Is there any way to have a 'base' eclipse installation and multiple 'extensions' that share the same base installation?
Oct 18 05:04:01 <mvvvv>	Lachezar, did you tried eclipse installer ?
Oct 18 05:07:00 <mistria>	mvvvv: +1, that's a (the?) big benefit of the installer to share the bundles
Oct 18 05:07:29 <mistria>	Lachezar: in any case, features are supposed to live well together, if there are some conflicts, make sure they're reported
Oct 18 05:07:59 <mistria>	Lachezar: Eclipse could totatlly have a single instance with lots of features
Oct 18 05:08:10 <Lachezar>	mvvvv: Not really. I did not see "multiple installations" in the feature list.
Oct 18 05:08:16 <mistria>	Lachezar: it's a pity if some bad quality features preent it from being doable
Oct 18 05:20:02 <Lachezar>	mistria: It's rarely a question of quality, mostly it's just the sheer amount of infrastructure. Just add Spring, GWT, Maven, J2EE, Oracle Glassfish and Eclipse barely boots. Add the Mylin sh*t and CTRL-Space gets an OOME on 16G RAM.
Oct 18 05:20:49 *	Lachezar always uses the bare minimum package to install Eclipse to avoid Mylin.
Oct 18 05:21:32 <mistria>	Lachezar: I would consider as a quality bug
Oct 18 05:21:42 <mistria>	Lachezar: in one of those features
Oct 18 05:22:07 <mistria>	Lachezar: Maven and JEE are shipped by default and work fine together, I believe Spring is OK too
Oct 18 05:22:21 <Lachezar>	mistria: None of these is bad on its own (except Mylin). It's when you combine those it becomes overcomplicated and slow.
Oct 18 05:22:24 <mistria>	Lachezar: in any case, with Neon, you can uninstall Mylyn from the package
Oct 18 05:22:39 <mistria>	Lachezar: you should report those
Oct 18 05:23:47 <Lachezar>	mistria: Reporting is met with a "Works for me", "Wont Fix", "Your Own Fault". It's futile, so no use in reporting.
Oct 18 05:24:10 <mistria>	Lachezar: being a good quality feature is not about woking well on it's own, it's also about working well with others
Oct 18 05:24:24 <mistria>	Lachezar: same as if an app crashes your OS, a feature shouldn't crash Eclipse
Oct 18 05:24:44 <Lachezar>	mistria: That's a good Christmas Wish, but rather unrealistic :)
Oct 18 05:24:57 <mistria>	Lachezar: do you have reference to such reports where you got a Won't Fix?
Oct 18 05:25:52 <mistria>	Lachezar: it's not a christmas wish, most Eclipse.org faetures respect that rule
Oct 18 05:26:11 <mistria>	Lachezar: those who don't respect this and screw up the IDE should be blamed
Oct 18 05:28:35 <Lachezar>	mistria: Most of the stuff I need to add is not eclipse.org: Android, Spring, GWT, Glassfish are all 3-rd party
Oct 18 05:29:15 <mistria>	Lachezar: Android is now Eclipse.org, it's called Andmore and it's in the "Eclipse for Android Develoeprs" package
Oct 18 05:29:35 <mistria>	Lachezar: if the issue is caused by Spring or GWT or Glassfish or whatever, you should report it there
Oct 18 05:29:41 *	Lachezar missed the Neon release. Now there are a dozen of installations that need rebuilding.
Oct 18 05:30:08 <mistria>	Lachezar: and if you get inappropriate answer, you can still put bad comments on marketplace
Oct 18 05:30:32 <Lachezar>	mistria: Nice, but trolling is not my thing :)
Oct 18 05:30:33 <mistria>	Lachezar: consider adding favourites to marketplace, with Neon you can easily install them
Oct 18 05:30:56 <mistria>	Lachezar: it's not trolling, it's being fair about who's responsible
Oct 18 05:31:18 <mistria>	Lachezar: many people troll about Eclipse because of some 3rd parties, that's unfair
Oct 18 05:31:35 <mistria>	Lachezar: let's troll the 3rd parties then and put some pressure to have them improving quality
Oct 18 05:31:49 <Lachezar>	mistria: That's the thing. I might view Whoever as being responsible, which might not be correct. Eclipse ecosystem is way too big for anyone to understand completely.
Oct 18 05:32:17 <mistria>	Lachezar: it's similar to OS and applications
Oct 18 05:32:39 <mistria>	Lachezar: if you install a video player and suddenly your OS crashes when you start it, you blame the video player
Oct 18 05:32:42 <mistria>	not the OS
Oct 18 05:32:52 <mistria>	Lachezar: should be the same for Eclipse plugins
Oct 18 05:37:31 <Lachezar>	mistria: No, in my own experience if the video player crashes it's probably faulty video card drivers.
Oct 18 05:38:33 *	Lachezar is wondering if he needs to boot a virtual machine to try the Eclipse Installer out.
Oct 18 05:39:36 *	Lachezar likes the Android@Eclipse icon, really nice blend.
Oct 18 05:42:14 <Lachezar>	mistria: In order to run Eclopse properly on my Xubuntu I have to specify UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0, GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1, add special GTK2_RC_FILES environment, override the PATH and JAVA_HOME, specify vm and -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.DefaultType=mozilla
Oct 18 05:42:37 <Lachezar>	mistria: whose fault is this? *buntu? Debian? Eclipse? Java?
Oct 18 05:49:47 <mistria>	Lachezar: it's Ubuntu's IIRC, they package Eclipse differently
Oct 18 05:50:00 <mistria>	LAchezar: the browser.DefaultType was fixed for Neon IIRC
Oct 18 05:50:26 <mistria>	Lachezar: Ubuntu package *GTK3* differently, in a non-compatible way with vanilla GTK annd SWT requirements
Oct 18 05:51:16 <mistria>	Lachezar: but IIRC, the menuproxy was fixed in Neon too
Oct 18 05:52:10 <mistria>	Lachezar: I never heard about need to tweak path and java_home in GTK2 files
Oct 18 05:53:09 <mistria>	Lachezar: reference https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/java-common/+bug/1552764
Oct 18 05:53:22 <mistria>	Lachezar: just get a Fedora, it's soooo much better :P
Oct 18 05:58:47 <Lachezar>	mistria: The Path and Java Home tweaks are needed to make Eclipse and Android SDK (whe ran from Eclipse) use similar JVM, because the Android plugin does not use the project's JVM, but a system default one, and since I have J8 installed, butr projects use older (for older Android) I get "Incompatible class version 52.0" (or somethign of the sorts).
Oct 18 05:59:17 <mistria>	Lachezar: ah ok
Oct 18 05:59:36 <mistria>	Lachezar: you can also set a "-vm /path/to/vm" in eclipse.ini
Oct 18 05:59:45 <mistria>	Lachezar: it avoid leaking to all GTK apps
Oct 18 06:02:21 <Lachezar>	mistria: I'm using .desktop files to set those things per Eclipse instance, not system default.
Oct 18 06:02:36 <Lachezar>	mistria: Here's my program line: env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1 GTK2_RC_FILES=/home/lachezar/development/eclipse/eclipse_gtkrc JAVA_HOME=/home/lachezar/development/kits/J2SDK-1.8.0 PATH=/home/lachezar/development/kits/J2SDK-1.8.0/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin /home/lachezar/development/meclipse/eclipse/eclipse -vm
Oct 18 06:02:41 <Lachezar>	/home/lachezar/development/kits/J2SDK-1.8.0/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so -vmargs -Xms256M -Xmx1024M -XX:PermSize=96M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.DefaultType=mozilla
Oct 18 06:02:56 <Lachezar>	mistria: crazy right?
Oct 18 06:03:16 <mistria>	Lachezar: yes, and I think you should consider dropping some of them
Oct 18 06:03:55 <mistria>	Lachezar: if you set JAVA_HOME, you don't have to set path; the MENUPROXY and NATIVE_WINDOWS are useless with Neon IIRC
Oct 18 06:04:12 <mistria>	Lachezar: any maybe also the browser.DefaultType
Oct 18 06:04:28 <Lachezar>	mistria: That's what I thought, but I have other java in Path, that gets precedence if I do not override PATH :(
Oct 18 06:04:41 <mistria>	Lachezar: the PermSize is not useful since java 8
Oct 18 06:05:18 <Lachezar>	mistria: Still not on Neon, but with most previous versions without the GDK and MENUPROXY envs the pop-up windows were not focusable, I had to kill eclipse :(
Oct 18 06:05:48 <Lachezar>	mistria: Permsize is remnant, because I was using 1.7 until 1 month ago.
Oct 18 06:06:02 <mistria>	Lachezar: or maybe you're also using an older ubuntu?
Oct 18 06:06:21 <Lachezar>	mistria: Not really: 16.04 Xubuntu.
Oct 18 06:06:32 <mistria>	Lachezar: seems like you've got many problems from the past ;)
Oct 18 06:07:08 <Lachezar>	mistria: Yep, and they just mount up. If I remove the GDK I still get Eclipse hangs (seems like the repaint thread hangs).
Oct 18 06:08:13 <Lachezar>	mistria: Thanks for the time wasted, I'm going for lunch with my colleagues now, I'll get back in 1 hour and look at what the installer provides. It looks to me like it just manages multiple Eclipse installations easier, but I still end up having dozen installations.

Oct 18 06:52:30 <kmenzli>	When I tried to export the plugin as a «deployment feature» I get some exceptions (I fixed them by dropping the dependencies jstl and common-el). (I'm using eclipse 4.5.2
Oct 18 06:52:32 <kmenzli>	When I started my tomcat there are no exception but when I point to http://localhost:8080/help, there is nothing
Oct 18 06:59:10 <mistria>	kmenzli: did you check whether the content of the war seems correct?
Oct 18 07:01:50 <kmenzli>	How could I check it?
Oct 18 07:01:52 <kmenzli>	Are there any reference .war that I can use to test the system help on tomcat server 7.0.45
Oct 18 07:02:33 <kmenzli>	(I'm using sdk 1.8 to run my tomcat)
Oct 18 07:09:37 <mistria>	kmenzil: not sure about a reference .war, but looking at the web.xml in it and looking at the tomcat log can help
Oct 18 07:10:05 <mistria>	kmenzli: my first thought is that maybe it's not deployed (at all) or it's not at the expected /help location
Oct 18 07:11:43 <kmenzli>	I don't think so, since I deployed the help as a folder and not as a .war.
Oct 18 07:11:45 <kmenzli>	In Tomcat console it display that the /help webapp has been deployed
Oct 18 07:11:46 <kmenzli>	I put the help folder under tomcat/webapps folder
Oct 18 09:38:23 <micoft>	Is there a shell-script Editor for Eclipse Neon or beyond?  ShellEd hasn't worked for an age, and the author's been too busy to dal with reported bugs for awhile.
Oct 18 09:38:28 <micoft>	Simply looking for an alternative.
Oct 18 11:08:56 <Lachezar>	Hm. Is there an option to remove the "secure storage" from eclipse, or at least make it use an unshared storage, as in every eclipse instance should have its own?
Oct 18 12:41:02 <tuxlof>	hi guys I have auto indent & code completion in my past 2 projects, but now my third one suddenly doesn't has it anymore. If I open the former two they still do, what's going on? I'm a new user
Oct 18 12:41:19 <tuxlof>	I suspect maybe I did some weird keyboard combination by accident
Oct 18 12:43:20 <tuxlof>	hmm when I make a new project it works again so nvm :')
Oct 18 12:59:14 <nitind_>	Lachezar: Yes, the -keyring option. I think. http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Frunning_eclipse.htm

Oct 19 09:32:37 <chibby0ne>	I'm trying to create an Eclipse product distribution. But when I launch it, it fails due to "Unable to acquire application service. Ensure that the org.eclipse.core.runtime bundle is resolved and started (see config.ini)". In the Product file's Content tab, when I click 'Add required' nothing gets added! The only artifacts listed are the one I manually added. How does the product file work? Do I have to manually add everything?
Oct 19 10:38:02 <mistria>	Lachezar: can you please elaborate? I should only write under the .eclipse directory
Oct 19 10:38:41 <mistria>	chibby0ne: does your product include the org.eclipse.rcp feature? I believe it's the only necessary one
Oct 19 10:38:59 <mistria>	chibby0ne: or maybe just org.eclipse.e4.rcp is enouhg
Oct 19 10:42:42 <chibby0ne>	mistria, hey mistria. No it doesn't. I will add it now. I managed to make it work (at least it opens eclipse), by just clicking "Add Recommended" in the Configuration tab on the start levels, which adds a bunch of org.eclipse.equinox* and org.eclipse.core, and then manually adding every org.eclipse.equinox.* feature I could find on the Content tab. But I was noticing that the UI looks awful, had no welcome page and can't show the About Eclipse

Oct 19 10:50:42 <chibby0ne>	mistria, didn't work. It couldn't find "org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench".
Oct 19 10:51:08 <chibby0ne>	mistria, I forgot to mention that I also added "org.eclipse.cdt.platform" to the mix.
Oct 19 10:51:33 <mistria>	chibby0ne: ok, I don't know what's the miminal feature for an IDE, the org.eclipse.rcp is the minimal one for an RCP but doesn't include IDE parts
Oct 19 10:52:08 <chibby0ne>	mistria, I see ok
Oct 19 10:52:19 <mistria>	chibby0ne: you should look at the EPP package definition as example

I can define working sets in the explorer view, but those seem to be different from the working sets that I can specify when importing projects.  It would be convenient if I could import projects and have them appear in the correct working sets in the explorer, but I always

Oct 21 16:25:12 <jalexander>	hello!  quick question, is there any intention to add fluent setters for source generation?
Oct 21 16:25:22 <jalexander>	because that would be pretty keen
Oct 21 16:28:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	jalexander: It would, but the problem with that is that there are different ideas on what that those setters should look like.  Some people believe the Builder pattern is basically the same thing, and that's typically done in a separate class.  In practice, as I often add fluent setters, it takes just a minute to clone them from the setter methods.  If I
Oct 21 16:28:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	really had to do that often, I would write an Emacs macro.
Oct 21 16:29:38 <jalexander>	right right. return this vs return builder of this...
Oct 21 16:29:39 <jalexander>	fair enough

Oct 21 17:34:05 <davidmichaelkarr>	Guest70350: Fix what?  You'd have to provide more information.  From the server's point of view, Java source code is just text.  That doesn't cause CNF errors.

Oct 26 13:18:06 <Zemeio>	Hi guys. I am trying to debug an application with remote debugger, I put the breakpoint in one of the .class, and the debugger stops at the other one. I believe this is because both classes have the same package. Anyone knows how to force it to stop at the other class?
Oct 26 13:19:26 <nitind>	You say the same package, are they also the same class name?
Oct 26 13:24:41 <Kaje>	I'm relatively new to DI in e4. I have a part class MyPart and a tool bar menu item that is handled by a MyHandler class. I want to get the instance of MyPart, so I tried including it in the argument list of my @Execute method. This caused that method to simply not be called.
Oct 26 13:25:40 <Kaje>	Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's because the instance of MyPart was not added to the context. How do I do that? I've tried googling for "eclipse e4 add part to context dependency injection"
Oct 26 13:36:16 <Hikigan3>	hi everyone
Oct 26 14:10:07 <Kaje>	So, I think I did it. In my part's @PostConstruct method, I added this parameter: "IEclipseContext context"
Oct 26 14:10:27 <Kaje>	Then, I added this line at the top of the method: context.set(MyPart.class, this);
Oct 26 14:11:01 <Kaje>	Is this a good way to do it? Which context is being injected into "context"? Is that the part's context or a higher level one?
Oct 26 14:11:38 <Kaje>	Once I did that, I was able to add MyPart p to the parameter list in my handler's @Execute method and it was injected correctly.
Oct 26 14:14:36 <CuriousErnestBro>	how to get eclipse working with hidpi screens on ubuntu?
Oct 26 14:15:22 <CuriousErnestBro>	putting this in my desktop file doesn't work
Oct 26 14:15:23 <CuriousErnestBro>	Exec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 eclipse46 --force-device-scale-factor=1.5 %U
Oct 26 14:16:18 <nitind>	Only 4.6.0?
Oct 26 14:17:48 <CuriousErnestBro>	I have the latest
Oct 26 14:18:10 <CuriousErnestBro>	I just called it eclipse46
Oct 26 14:18:22 *	CuriousErnestBro was following an install tutorial for eclipse44
Oct 26 14:19:28 <CuriousErnestBro>	Version: Neon.1a Release (4.6.1)
Oct 26 14:19:28 <CuriousErnestBro>	Build id: 20161007-1200
Oct 26 14:20:04 <CuriousErnestBro>	everything is tiny :/
Oct 26 14:21:19 <nitind>	CuriousErnestBro: https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.6/platform.php#swt-autoscale-tweaks
Oct 26 14:22:51 <CuriousErnestBro>	so in my case: GDK_DPI_SCALE=1.5 /opt/eclipse/eclipse
Oct 26 14:22:54 <CuriousErnestBro>	I'll try it
Oct 26 14:23:18 <nitind>	Why's it in /opt?
Oct 26 14:23:33 <CuriousErnestBro>	the tutorial made me do it
Oct 26 14:23:42 <CuriousErnestBro>	wait...
Oct 26 14:23:56 <CuriousErnestBro>	maybe I installed 2 versions (I used "which eclipse")
Oct 26 14:24:12 <ykrons>	hi

Oct 26 14:24:55 <CuriousErnestBro>	nitind, apparently I installed 2
Oct 26 14:25:02 <CuriousErnestBro>	eclipse is in opt
Oct 26 14:25:08 <CuriousErnestBro>	eclipse46 is in /usr/local/bin/eclipse46
Oct 26 14:26:03 <ykrons>	With Neon, I can't select RSE connection in remote debug option? Is it a bug or a different default behavior?
Oct 26 14:30:18 <CuriousErnestBro>	I tried
Oct 26 14:30:33 <CuriousErnestBro>	eclipse46 -vmargs -Dswt.autoScale=200
Oct 26 14:30:37 <CuriousErnestBro>	didn't work :/
Oct 26 14:33:08 <nitind>	And if you actually go to where it is and run the eclipse binary directly?
Oct 26 14:33:52 <CuriousErnestBro>	GDK_DPI_SCALE=2 eclipse46 does work but it is HUGE and pixelated
Oct 26 14:33:56 <CuriousErnestBro>	I'll try that
Oct 26 14:35:26 <CuriousErnestBro>	nope, same result
Oct 26 14:35:39 <CuriousErnestBro>	(I'm sure I set up the eclipse46 thingy correctly)
Oct 26 14:37:55 <Zemeio>	Hi guys. I am using the remote debugger, and eclipse opens another file (same .class) at a different point in the file (like it wasn't aligned, but I copied the .class to eclipse to be sure). Anyone had this problem before?
Oct 26 14:38:16 <CuriousErnestBro>	nitind, GDK_DPI_SCALE=1.2 eclipse46
Oct 26 14:38:23 <CuriousErnestBro>	seems like a good thing
Oct 26 14:38:26 <CuriousErnestBro>	so it works
Oct 26 14:38:32 <CuriousErnestBro>	but sometimes it gives a fatal error
Oct 26 14:54:06 <Zemeio>	I think the decompiler (jd) is failing to realign line numbers = /
Oct 26 15:19:30 <[twisti]>	i have a problem with m2e-apt and dagger 2, the code generation just doesnt seem to run (but it does when i do a manual mvn compile). any idea how to debug this ?
Oct 26 15:47:20 <[twisti]>	i guess m2e is broken in neon
Oct 26 15:47:38 <[twisti]>	even manually configuring annotation processing doesnt work at all
Oct 26 15:50:46 <Zemeio>	Guys, do you have any recommendation for a plugin that aligns the .class with the debug? Everything seems to fail = /. Eclipse is running on java 8. The code is compiled on java 7.
Oct 26 17:26:00 <Kaje>	I have an e4 RCP app. I need to run some code to check a license file and do some other start up initialization every time the application launches. What's the best place to do that? Should I do it in my main plugin's activator?
Oct 26 17:26:29 <Kaje>	In e3, I had a call in the ApplicationWorkbenchWindowAdvisor.postWindowCreate() method.

Oct 27 09:21:41 <davidmichaelkarr>	elemnn: in any case, it's not useful to assess code coverage on your unit tests. You want to assess code coverage on the code under test.
Oct 27 09:23:39 <elemnn>	ok, I think I understand, thanks
Oct 27 09:24:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	elemnn: in other words, you should have an "exclude" spec for "*Test" or something similar.
Oct 27 09:24:21 <WrinkledCheese>	Hey all, I'm trying to find documentation on setting up eclips so that when I open a source file that has TODO comments in the source, they populate the task list, optimally in it's own category Eg. category Source Tasks contains a list of TODO tasks found within the active source file
Oct 27 09:24:32 <elemnn>	yeah I see
Oct 27 09:31:47 <WrinkledCheese>	Is there a possibility to do this?
Oct 27 09:32:27 <WrinkledCheese>	Clicking around it seems like I would install a "connector"
Oct 27 09:33:14 <WrinkledCheese>	However, it doesn't appear that there is a connector to automatically parse the active source file and parse TODOs to generate a category of tasks in the tasks list

Oct 31 10:05:57 <hanshenrik>	may have to restart eclipse
Oct 31 10:06:03 <hanshenrik>	but shouldn't need a reboot, no
Oct 31 10:06:27 <hanshenrik>	the fact that it works in your browser now, means that the redirect in hosts file is working
Oct 31 10:07:09 <ikaaa>	tried restarting eclipse already but getting same error message :(
Oct 31 10:09:38 <hanshenrik>	huh, i'm stumped. note that most web browsers are retarded (including Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Chrome), and thinks that a download succeeded when the file size !== content-length header. use a proper download manager (like firefox's DownThemAll or freedownloadmanager.org) , and see if you really can download it, or if its just truncated without warning
Oct 31 10:10:18 <ikaaa>	ok i will try
Oct 31 10:10:25 <hanshenrik>	or you can go developer mode in your browser and look at the content-length header manually and compare it to the downloaded file size
Oct 31 10:13:58 <hanshenrik>	ikaaa, you can go to http://dl.bintray.com/  , then open developer console, and run: xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open("GET","http://dl.bintray.com/nodeclipse/nodeclipse/1.0.2f/plugins/org.nodeclipse.debug_1.0.2.201509250223.jar");
Oct 31 10:13:58 <hanshenrik>	xhr.send();        then wait 2 seconds, and run xhr.getResponseHeader("content-length")
Oct 31 10:13:58 <hanshenrik>	;
Oct 31 10:14:13 <hanshenrik>	then compare that to the filesize you downloaded
Oct 31 10:19:03 <ikaaa>	xhr.getResponseHeader("content-length"); returns null ^^
Oct 31 10:20:03 <ikaaa>	and down them all fails to download and says (translated) somethin like "size different"
Oct 31 10:27:16 <ikaaa>	also when i run xhr.open("GET","http://dl.bintray.com/nodeclipse/nodeclipse/1.0.2f/plugins/org.nodeclipse.debug_1.0.2.201509250223.jar"); it console prompts undefined ^^
Oct 31 10:28:11 <ikaaa>	thinks thats why getResponseHeader return null :/
Oct 31 10:40:01 <ikaaa>	is it possible that the file is corrupted somehow ?
Oct 31 10:58:10 <nitind>	What's the content encoding? Length isn't always provided.
Oct 31 11:02:09 <ikaaa>	xhr.getResponseHeader("content-encoding"); return null als if thats what u asked for :D ... sry i´m still a newb too web developement
Oct 31 11:04:10 <nitind>	Very off topic, but something else is going on. curl -I -v of that URL has values.
Oct 31 11:05:06 <ikaaa>	what does that mean :D?
Oct 31 11:05:40 <nitind>	Look at the output of "curl -I http://dl.bintray.com/nodeclipse/nodeclipse/1.0.2f/plugins/org.nodeclipse.debug_1.0.2.201509250223.jar". Running a JavaScript xhr get is not the simplest way to test these things.
Oct 31 11:13:58 <ikaaa>	ok done
Oct 31 11:14:06 <ikaaa>	curl output:
Oct 31 11:14:11 <ikaaa>	HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Oct 31 11:14:37 <ikaaa>	so the content length is fine why does eclipse throw the error :( ?
Oct 31 11:14:39 <nitind>	ok, uh, we don't need to see all of that. it's probably a network hiccup.
Oct 31 11:15:16 <ikaaa>	hm damn :(
Oct 31 11:16:37 <ikaaa>	well my end of work is in 30 min think i´ll just try to install it tomorrow again xD
Oct 31 11:19:48 <ikaaa>	and try to look busy for the next 30 min xD
Oct 31 11:31:59 <ikaaa>	well guys thank you very much for all your help :D i hope i won´t face the same problem tomorrow xD
Oct 31 12:32:16 <Khasyk>	Hello peepz, I was wandering if there is some sort of problem @ eclipse.org, because im getting a http 500 error when i'm trying to install eclipse for windows

Oct 31 14:36:10 <feneco>	is there a way to download libraries from eclipse? like jsf/primefaces/hibernate/mysqlconnector without having to do it manually?
Oct 31 14:37:25 <davidmichaelkarr>	feneco: Typically, people define a Maven or Gradle build script, which specifies dependencies, relying on artifacts on public (or private) maven repositories, and that does all the work internally to make the artifacts available for your build.

Oct 31 15:28:47 <pukapy123>	is there a way in eclipse to like run the .java program in a terminal or something instead of the eclipse console?
Oct 31 15:38:02 <davidmichaelkarr>	pukapy123: By definition, running it in eclipse means running it in eclipse. The workspace is reachable from outside of eclipse, so you can construct a java command line.  It's not clear why you would want to do this.
Oct 31 15:41:05 <tokam>	Is there a plugin, which allows me to persist the undo-commands when editing a .java file in the editor?
Oct 31 15:41:14 <tokam>	so that I can close and open eclipse and press ctrl+z?
Oct 31 15:44:55 <pukapy123>	but the console is weird like it puts the pointer at the beginning of the line sometimes
Oct 31 17:41:26 <hanmac>	hi i seems to have a problem with oomph ... after it did run the startup stuff, it does it again each time i start eclipse ... its a bit anoying specially it does reset my workbench settings!
Nov 01 12:53:06 <JuJUBee>	I just installed eclipse on a kde system and I cannot read the text in a tab (navigator) unless it is a selected tab.  White text on the tab with light gray not good.
Nov 01 12:57:42 <mvvvv>	thanks so I guess I can't use elm-reactor anymore ?
Nov 01 12:58:22 <Pratik_katte>	Hey guys can you pleases help me out how to use This IRC
Nov 01 12:59:14 <Pratik_katte>	How can I see the list of topics..
Nov 01 13:01:02 <mvvvv>	sorry bad channel
Nov 01 13:03:17 <mvvvv>	JuJUBee, I guess you have to change your gtk3 theme
Nov 01 13:04:20 <JuJUBee>	mvvvv, I will look into it.
Nov 02 00:43:39 <johngilbrough>	Where in eclipse is the comment template '/*' <cr> ' *' <cr> ' */' defined?
Nov 02 00:44:13 <johngilbrough>	I couldn't find in anywhere in Code Templates...
Nov 02 00:46:22 <davidmichaelkarr>	johngilbrough: Uh, in "Templates"? The "Files" template.
Nov 02 00:47:33 <davidmichaelkarr>	johngilbrough: Actually, it's in "Code Templates".
Nov 02 00:47:52 <johngilbrough>	davidmichaelkarr, But where ??
Nov 02 00:48:38 <davidmichaelkarr>	johngilbrough: Just enter "templates" in the filter field, then click on "Code Templates", then "Files".
Nov 02 00:50:00 <johngilbrough>	davidmichaelkarr, I've already changed the c/C++/Code Style/Comments/File template, but that has no effect.
Nov 02 00:51:04 <johngilbrough>	davidmichaelkarr, Do I need to restart Eclipse each time I change a template?
Nov 02 00:52:28 <johngilbrough>	davidmichaelkarr, I restarted Eclipse, still no effect
Nov 02 00:56:22 <davidmichaelkarr>	johngilbrough: What are you doing to test the template?
Nov 02 00:57:08 <johngilbrough>	Changing it to '/***' <cr> '*' <cr> '***/'
Nov 02 00:57:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	johngilbrough: No, I asked what are you doing to TEST the template?  What makes you think the change is having no effect?
Nov 02 00:58:03 <johngilbrough>	davidmichaelkarr, By trying it out in a open c++ source.
Nov 02 00:58:39 <davidmichaelkarr>	johngilbrough: Those templates are used when you create a new empty file of that particular type, so in your case a new C++ file.
Nov 02 00:59:47 <johngilbrough>	davidmichaelkarr, As I move along in my code I enter multi-line comments - what template effects those?
Nov 02 01:01:51 <davidmichaelkarr>	johngilbrough: Are you referring to the fact that it creates a new line with just a "*" lined up on the previous "*"?  I'm not aware of a template that controls that.  If that's now what you're talking about, you have to actually state what you're talking about.
Nov 02 01:02:02 <davidmichaelkarr>	"that's not what"
Nov 02 01:03:18 <johngilbrough>	davidmichaelkarr, No.  I mean when I enter '/***', it fills in ' *' <cr> ' */' instead of the desired '*' <cr> '***/'
Nov 02 01:07:35 <johngilbrough>	davidmichaelkarr, Have gander at https://dpaste.de/J07D
Nov 02 01:12:54 <johngilbrough>	davidmichaelkarr, So did I loose you there?
Nov 02 01:22:34 <johngilbrough>	I prefer multi-line C++ comments throughout my code in the form '/***' cr '*   <comment>' cr '***/'.  Does anyone know where the template is that helps with this?

Nov 02 13:35:22 <pukapy123>	i did something wrong and now my file browsing where was my projects and packes and classes is gone
Nov 02 13:35:26 <pukapy123>	how can i put it back? :D
Nov 02 13:35:44 <pukapy123>	solved it
Nov 02 14:29:48 <johngilbrough>	I prefer multi-line C++ comments throughout my code in the form '/***' cr '*   <comment>' cr '***/'.  Does anyone know where the template is that helps with this?
Nov 02 14:41:44 <mistria>	hey gercan, wassup?
Nov 02 18:17:36 <hanshenrik>	the options in C/C++ -> Editor -> Save Actions are completely ignored, it seems
Nov 02 18:18:10 <hanshenrik>	any idea why/how to fix? im telling it to "format all lines" and "remove trailing whitespace in all lines" on save, but it doesn't
Nov 02 18:19:06 <hanshenrik>	now i have to manually press ctrl+shift+f  instead
Nov 02 18:19:17 <hanshenrik>	4.6.1
Nov 02 18:50:10 <nitind>	hanshenrik: Is the source file set up to be built in a C Project?
Nov 02 18:52:13 <hanshenrik>	nitind, no it's not set to be built. also, it's in a "virtual folder pointing to another directory on the same filesystem", that might be a contributing factor
Nov 02 23:38:19 <ke4nhw>	I am starting a new project, it's asking me about Subversive Connector Discovery (running Neon). There are three options. Do I only need the top one (pure Java) or do I need one of the other two (presumedly the one compatible 1.8x - 1.9x)? Or all 3. Oh, do I want to make my workspace where the repo will be or let subversive handle this?
Nov 02 23:39:27 <johngilbrough>	I prefer multi-line C++ comments throughout my code in the form '/***' cr '*   <comment>' cr '***/'.  Does anyone know where the template is that helps with this?
Nov 02 23:40:19 <ke4nhw>	Currently my workspace directory is not the repo directory
Nov 02 23:41:16 <ke4nhw>	Also, once I download the subversive connectors, are these connectors per project or once I download them I won't be asked again?
Nov 02 23:43:47 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: you can install multiple connectors, but you can only select one.
Nov 02 23:44:29 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: not sure what you mean by repo directory. This isn't git.
Nov 02 23:44:57 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: connectors are plugins. Done per workspace.
Nov 02 23:46:51 <ke4nhw>	Okay, so no point in install multiple connectors. The top one says pure java no binaries necessary. and by repo I mean the base of the repository in the server, such as /var/svn/repos/JavaRepo/ as given to svnserve by 'svnserve -d -r /var/svn/repos/Java/repo'
Nov 02 23:47:19 <ke4nhw>	So should I have my workspace at that location or should I keep my workspace local?
Nov 02 23:48:44 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: it's very rare to run the svn server on the same box.
Nov 02 23:48:59 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: separate.
Nov 02 23:51:03 <ke4nhw>	svn server is running on my linux server. Just so happens that I also have a Samba file server running over there as well. It's in my local network but is a separate machine from where I am actually working.
Nov 02 23:52:56 <ke4nhw>	Prior to considering a svn server though I did set my workspaces to directories on the server: saves space on my local machine, kept the project in a safer location (less likely to crash than my main machine), among other reasons.
Nov 02 23:59:08 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: i'm confused. You put the svn server on local box and workspace on the server? Completely opposite of where they should be.
Nov 03 00:01:06 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: Ah, I missed the samba comment.
Nov 03 00:01:27 <ke4nhw>	Maybe I explained it wrong. I have several computers in my network, but I have one server running Linux. On that server I have had Samba running as a fileserver for some time, and recently, on that same linux server, I installed subversion and svnserve, so that both samba and svn exist on the server
Nov 03 00:01:54 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: In any case, having your workspaces on the server (shared with samba?) will slow down all accesses to the workspace. Not a good tradeoff.
Nov 03 00:03:37 <ke4nhw>	Up until now my workspaces have been on directories that are on the server. What I wanted was version control, the ability to collaborate, and to be able to have a local working copy (especially when I am out and about somewhere with no network access, I can pull a working copy before I leave and commit changes when I return) and to work on the same code from multiple machines.
Nov 03 00:05:13 <ke4nhw>	svn fit this bill, and what I would like to do with all future projects (and maybe existing) is to have working copies local and versioned on the server. That's why I was asking if the workspace had to be the same as the directory svnserve set as the repo
Nov 03 00:07:59 <ke4nhw>	Knowing now that I can keep my workspace local and work from the svnserver works out well. Makes it easy to work on projects when away regardless of network access (when out somewhere security has already been addressed: I have OpenVPN on that server and on my laptop so all access to the server, even an ssh connection, runs through the ovpn)
Nov 03 00:08:59 <ke4nhw>	And if I don't have network access, no problem: I'll have checked out the latest revision, can work on it local, and commit when I get home or to somewhere I can get Internet
Nov 03 00:09:36 <ke4nhw>	The only question I have left is whether or not I can change the workspace directory of an existing project without losing or corrupting the data.
Nov 03 00:12:16 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: if offline work is a priority, git might have been a better choice.
Nov 03 00:12:57 <ke4nhw>	For example, if I set the workspace to be R:\Hello\World (where R: is a Samba share from the server that is assigned this "drive" letter in Map Network Drive by Windows) can I change the workspace to C:\JavaStuff\Hello\World (where C is the local hard drive)
Nov 03 00:13:07 <ke4nhw>	It's not a priority, but it would be nice
Nov 03 00:13:08 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: you can "change" the workspace of a project by simply doing "open existing project".
Nov 03 00:14:14 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: you can't really change the location of an existing workspace.
Nov 03 00:14:39 <ke4nhw>	Okay, so create a new workspace, open an existing project, and save it there then?
Nov 03 00:15:07 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: but you can create a new workspace and then "open existing project".
Nov 03 00:15:26 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: yes.
Nov 03 00:16:34 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: the advantage of git for offline is that you can still do commits.
Nov 03 00:16:45 <ke4nhw>	And svn can handle offline work with no more users than I have. At present I am the only user, but I am expecting two more, maybe three more, to start helping me with these programs. I'm not going to have 200 lead developers for Microsoft, Oracle, et al committing changes every few milliseconds.
Nov 03 00:18:37 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: you can commit changes with svn offline?
Nov 03 00:18:37 <ke4nhw>	Odds of having a whole slew of conflicts are pretty low, especially right now as I'm the only one using it (mainly to keep track of my changes, have the ability to backstep, and have a system in place for when others do want to either look at the code or help work with it.
Nov 03 00:18:43 <ke4nhw>	no
Nov 03 00:18:46 <ke4nhw>	not that I'm aware of
Nov 03 00:19:10 <ke4nhw>	I'd have to wait until I get somewhere with an Internet connection, connect to my server, then commit
Nov 03 00:19:30 <ke4nhw>	I may be wrong and there might be a way, but I don't know of it
Nov 03 00:21:04 <ke4nhw>	Bear in mind that I'm not a professional developer, I'm an amateur at all this, and much of what I'm doing is literally for the learning experience to teach myself Java, Visual Basic 2010, Eclipse (as I like it better than IntelliJ and can't stand NetBeans) and a version control system. And when I read over the docs for git, woah...
Nov 03 00:21:10 <ke4nhw>	much more complicated
Nov 03 00:21:12 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: my point is that you can still "check in" changes with git offline.
Nov 03 00:22:07 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: git can definitely be confusing.
Nov 03 00:25:04 <ke4nhw>	Unless I paid for an account on Github. As for my learning, I prefer to do so by writing useful products so that not only am I learning but I am also writing something that I will use (or in this case we will use  as an amateur radio emergency communications team). How do you check in changes to a server if you aren't connected to it? does it cache it until you get a connection then perform
Nov 03 00:25:04 <ke4nhw>	the commit behind the scenes, or is the git on the same machine?
Nov 03 00:26:52 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: is this a commercial closed source project? If not, you don't have to pay to use github.
Nov 03 00:27:43 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: with git, a checkin is a local operation. The "push" operation goes to the server.
Nov 03 00:32:15 <ke4nhw>	It is not commercial, but given that we will be using this software in an emergency communications role in a hospital EOC environment (mind you our systems and this software will absolutely be completely separate of theirs so their lawyers and IT says that HIPAA Tempesting will not be required) and will possibly interface with, if not definitely carry radio traffic from, on-scene Incident
Nov 03 00:32:15 <ke4nhw>	Command, Incident Command of involved hospitals, county and state EOC's, and even DoD (NDMS Federal Coordinating Centers U.S. Army Medical Corps, again, no direct interface, no classified data, no tempesting) <cont>
Nov 03 00:32:28 <ke4nhw>	given these factors we do want to keep the source closed
Nov 03 00:35:56 <ke4nhw>	We are just lucky that A) this software is not required to do our job, it's just being developed to make our jobs easier, B) there will be no interface to protected or classified systems, which removes the tempesting requirements, C) I'm not working on a deadline, since this is simply an enhancement to how we already do our job, and D) being amateur radio we are allowed to develop our operational
Nov 03 00:35:56 <ke4nhw>	systems with a bit of technical freedom as long as we can demonstrate that any changes do indeed boost accuracy or operational efficiency.
Nov 03 00:36:16 <ke4nhw>	Downside: I won't make a penny for the program
Nov 03 00:38:24 <ke4nhw>	Being ham radio, federal law says that nothing that I do in relation to my hobby can be done with any pecuniary interest. Just like we aren't paid for any time we spend on exercises or actual deployments, we will not be paid for writing this program. It's all completely voluntary, which means we can show or not so, do or not do, no penalty, but also that no money is to be made.
Nov 03 00:40:52 <ke4nhw>	So... how would you classify that? The program is job-specific, task-specialized, intended to be used in a professional environment, by volunteers that cannot be paid, and the program and time developing it were completely free of charge even though they prefer that the source remain closed (except to their IT personnel)?
Nov 03 00:41:25 <ke4nhw>	And F*$#^D UP doesn't count as an official classification lol
Nov 03 00:42:18 <ke4nhw>	And yes, you're right, I remember that from the git docs now that you mention it... which is why I say git was a bit complicated for me.
Nov 03 00:43:12 <ke4nhw>	You still here?
Nov 03 00:45:26 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: i am. Not sure what to say. If it has to be closed source, then free github won't work.
Nov 03 00:45:28 <ke4nhw>	No worries, I'm not the federalies or some government agent. At best I'm a volunteer with my county emergency response team, a volunteer with several hospital groups, and the Tactical Administrator of our emergency communications organization, Greenville Spartanburg Area Specialized Emergency Communications, or GSPASEC (we do have a website at www.gspasec.org if you want to take a peek)
Nov 03 00:46:05 <ke4nhw>	Nope, github will cost us $7 a month, which isn't too bad, but still, I won't learn as much lol
Nov 03 00:47:18 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: new projects are all git, so if you want experience that is more portable ...
Nov 03 00:47:27 <ke4nhw>	And since I can't get paid a dime for this, the only thing I can get for my efforts is knowledge (which is just as well, because once I gain knowledge nobody can take that away from me and I can use it as much as I want and I won't lose a bit of it hopefully... Knowledge isn't a limited supply, money is)...
Nov 03 00:49:55 <ke4nhw>	Well I am getting ready to set up another physical server as our organization's hard server (and highly restricted server, that thing won't even have a port open to the outside except for a few OpenVPN ports), maybe I will put git on there and play with it, see how well it works in practice versus the documentation...
Nov 03 00:50:13 <ke4nhw>	So git is overrunning svn?
Nov 03 00:50:41 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: very much so.
Nov 03 00:54:47 <ke4nhw>	Well one thing I have to consider is that when I read through the git docs everything, and I mean everything, required the user to interact with the command line, which for me is fine but for others it might not be, and there was a great deal of complexity in using it as there were multiple commands to achieve one goal, etc, and to top this off the docs talked as though it wouldn't play nice
Nov 03 00:54:47 <ke4nhw>	with windows, in fact every cod I read highly recommended the install of CyGwin, again I'm fine with it but others.... If there's a better user interface for Eclipse that takes a bit of this complexity out for the user then it would be something to be considered...
Nov 03 00:56:28 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: egit in eclipse works fine.
Nov 03 00:57:07 <davidmichaelkarr>	ke4nhw: but i couldn't live without cygwin. :)
Nov 03 00:57:16 <ke4nhw>	Is it as complicated to use as the command line documentation for git clients (never mind the server side lol)
Nov 03 01:00:52 <ke4nhw>	as for cygwin, I'm a linux guy so yea I've got it too, but I'm almost exclusively a RedHat guy (CentOS, Fedora), and cygwin feels more like Debian or Slackware, it's a bit different (but still workable)
Nov 03 03:17:42 <mwayne>	are there any restrictions to the splash file like file size or dimension?
Nov 03 04:34:56 <Gamoder_>	Hi everyone, I got the following problem: Strangely eclipse detects a cycle in my projects, but I don't know why. Is there a way to find out which projects a project has as dependencies and why?
Nov 03 04:38:53 <Gamoder_>	a click on "Look for cycles in the dependency graph" shows me that there are no cycles?!
Nov 03 04:46:38 <Gamoder_>	I now just made eclipse ignore the error, but how can I fix it?
Nov 03 04:58:35 <nitind2>	What dependency graph are you talking about? What kind of dependencies are you talking about?
Nov 03 04:58:47 <Gamoder_>	plugin dependencies
Nov 03 05:22:54 <Unicorn437>	hey there, I'm trying to use a package given to me by my university in eclipse by including it in the build path and importing it in the project, yet it doesn't recognize the name of the .zip file. Any idea on what I could have done wrong/still got to do?
Nov 03 05:25:16 <mbooth>	Unicorn437: What is in the zip file? Some .jar files? If so, you probably need to unzip it first
Nov 03 05:26:45 <Unicorn437>	mbooth, it includes .jar files, but its supposed to work by doing packagename.jarname
Nov 03 05:27:01 <Unicorn437>	I tried extracting the one particular file I want to use and its not recognized either
Nov 03 05:28:22 <mbooth>	Unicorn437: What do you mean by "supposed to work by doing packagename.jarname"
Nov 03 05:37:19 <Unicorn437>	mbooth doesn't really matter, if I get it to work with just the jarname that'd be enough
Nov 03 05:37:54 <Unicorn437>	the package is called Prog1Tools and has a jar in it called IOTools, so I want to do import either Prog1Tools.IOTools or just import IOTools
Nov 03 05:38:12 <Unicorn437>	package as in .zip file
Nov 03 05:39:04 <mbooth>	Unicorn437: Usually you need to add the jar files to the build path, not zip file. Then your "import" statements need to reference classes inside those jar files.
Nov 03 05:39:38 <Unicorn437>	for a friend of mine it works entirely inside the .zip file, but he's on windows and I'm on ubuntu
Nov 03 05:39:48 <hanmac>	 i seems to have a problem with oomph ... after it did run the startup stuff, it does it again each time i start eclipse ... its a bit anoying specially it does reset my workbench settings!
Nov 03 05:40:23 <mbooth>	Unicorn437: For example, if a jar file contains a file "org/mbooth/MyClass.class" then your import statement should be "import org.mbooth.MyClass;"
Nov 03 05:41:08 <mbooth>	Unicorn437: You can't just reference a zip file name in an import statement
Nov 03 05:45:37 <Unicorn437>	mbooth, the jar is the class, it contains static methods to use
Nov 03 05:47:05 <mbooth>	Unicorn437: No, I think we have a terminology problem. Jars and classes are not the same. Jars contain classes.
Nov 03 05:51:19 <Unicorn437>	mbooth, I know that its not the same thing, I've coded in different IDEs earlier, where it was the way you described
Nov 03 05:51:59 <Unicorn437>	but I have a zip file which is full of jars which are supposed to be static classes, but my issue right now is, that it doesn't find the zip despite me specifying it in the build path
Nov 03 08:11:02 <EEVV>	So I tried to import a git, logged in just as it prompted me, but then I got an authentication error.

Nov 04 18:51:20 <arno_>	Hi. I'm trying to install latest eclipse. I'm on ubuntu 14.04. I tried to download Probably #eclipse as long as your question relates to Eclipse usage or plug-in/RCP development. If the issue is purely a language issue unrelated to Eclipse, you should find a more appropriate channel that deals with that programming language. For example, freenode has a ##java channel for Java-related questions. You will need
Nov 04 18:51:22 <arno_>	to be registered to nickserv to enter that channel though.
Nov 04 18:51:58 <arno_>	sorry, for some reason, the content of my clipboard found its way in that window
Nov 04 18:52:43 <arno_>	Anyway, I start again: I'm trying to install latest eclipse. I'm on ubuntu 14.04. I download the installer from https://eclipse.org/downloads/ When I run it, the installations stalls.

Nov 07 18:32:54 <kfunk>	according to http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Using_Eclipse_CDT#CMake_Builder the url http://www.cmakebuilder.com/update *was* the update site, but it's now dead

Nov 08 05:40:55 <Felix2>	Hello everyone, is anyone here using CDT and knows how to add system headers? I tried using the preprocessor paths but they don't get passed to the compiler for some reason.
Nov 08 06:39:31 <MasterKrain>	Hi, i was wondering where the default workspace is usually located. I can't find it anywhere on the internet
Nov 08 06:40:17 <MasterKrain>	Anyone online who knows where i can find it?
Nov 08 13:15:23 <josteele>	If I install a plugin that uses Activator.getDefault().getStateLocation() (the Activator of my plugin of course) to save meta information, and then I later uninstall that plugin, how would I go about having that Activator's state location cleared? In my situation, if the user decides to install, uninstall, and then later on re-install the plugin, I don't want the tooling to use previously saved meta at that location.
Nov 08 13:24:00 <josteele>	I have a similar question about uninstallation - my plugin contributes a perspective, which after uninstallation of my plugin I'd expect that perspective to get removed from the list of available perspectives, but it's not. I did notice the views are removed from the show-view dialog, but the perspective is still there, and if you go to it, the views are added to the perspective layout, of course they can't be rendered though. http:/
Nov 08 13:25:27 <josteele>	my target is Neon 4.60.1.Final
Nov 08 13:26:23 <josteele>	Is it possible that the Application model is saving that perspective and not getting cleared?
Nov 08 13:27:32 <rgrunber>	josteele: for deleting the statelocation data, i would try looking if it's possible to associate a touchpoint with your plugin as part of the uninstall.
Nov 08 13:27:49 <josteele>	touchwho?
Nov 08 13:28:20 <rgrunber>	josteele: http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2013/05/23/custom-touchpoints-in-p2/
Nov 08 13:29:20 <josteele>	rgrunber: you da man. this might do it
Nov 08 13:29:45 <rgrunber>	josteele: for a more basic intro there's also http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Fguide%2Fp2_actions_touchpoints.html
Nov 08 13:31:06 <rgrunber>	as for the perspective part of the question..
Nov 08 13:32:02 <rgrunber>	i've seen that before.. saved perspectives hanging around despite their contributing bundle being removed.
Nov 08 13:32:27 <rgrunber>	i would guess you have to do the same.. find some programmatic means of removal triggered on a touchpoint.
Nov 08 15:11:02 <Maxel>	I'm trying to use eclipse to deploy code to my weblogic server. I have source from a different common project and added in the build path of the application I'm trying to deploy
Nov 08 15:11:17 <Maxel>	it seems to not be deploying correctly however, getting a classnotfound error from within the common project

Nov 08 17:12:36 <donald1>	I want to run and just run the anonymouth software https://github.com/psal/anonymouth .

Nov 08 17:18:52 <jeen>	donald1: it’s not very clear what you’re after here, but the README on that project contains installation/build/run instructions. have you followed those?
Nov 08 17:19:13 <donald1>	yes I have
Nov 08 17:20:06 <jeen>	ok then what’s the problem?
Nov 08 17:20:44 <jeen>	“when we want to import a project downlaoded from git-hub to make everything but absolutely everything, do we have to click in the folder of our project or the src package” <— that sentence makes no sense. please explain what you’re trying to do.
Nov 08 17:21:33 <donald1>	jeen: yto run this program, do I have to import the code by clicking with the right button of the mouse at the folder or at the src package?
Nov 08 17:23:22 <jeen>	you don’t have to “import code” at all. simply select the class edu.drexel.psal.anonymouth.gooie.ThePresident, right-click, choose “run…”
Nov 08 17:27:31 <jeen>	oh ffs, I made the mistake of enabling maven index updating, now Neon is freezing on me again. Bloody useless :(
Nov 08 19:55:11 <ke4nhw>	Is anyone in here familiar with how to setup and configure a subversion server? I asked in subversion however they simply cut me off and ignored me when I suggested I wanted a different layout than the one that was being dictated to me and that I wanted to use an OpenVPN tunnel. Since this is off topic for this room, if someone could help (Please) we could move the conversation to ##gspasec
Nov 08 19:55:12 <ke4nhw>	(my room for our volunteer emergency communications group).
Nov 08 20:55:04 <jeen>	ke4nhw: I can’t really help you with subversion servers, but if you require a different layout wouldn’t it be easier to use a different VCS altogether, like git or mercurial? they have less restrictions about layout
Nov 09 03:56:46 <angular_mike_>	is there a way to rebind keys for Scala(and possibly other) interpreter, so that just ENTER is evaluate and something else, like CTRL ENTER+insterts newline?

Nov 09 18:57:59 <lostsoul_>	I have a build that seems to work (Debug), but it compiles (with errors) then immediately attempts to build a release version, but fails to pass include paths. Any ideas? This was working before I attempted to build a library. ;)
Nov 09 19:04:02 <jeen>	lostsoul_: imagine, for a second, that we don’t know you, your project, your build tool, or indeed exactly what you’ve done. now try and explain what your problem is :)
Nov 09 19:10:26 <lostsoul_>	KO... I'm using a 386p AVR Micro. I had a working build, and ship to target (via atmel Dragon).  I then attempted to build a library module with a bunch of Arduino sources.  This seems to work...  When I go back to a working project, it looks like it's trying to compile (as I can see a flash of errors, then it says it's doing a release and the compiler cli has not -i for includes.  Don't know why it's going to the release.  It's also
Nov 09 19:10:26 <lostsoul_>	populating file in the release directory. General idea.
Nov 09 19:11:32 <lostsoul_>	I added a syntax error to see it...
Nov 09 19:13:11 <jeen>	I may be out of my depth here (I know very little about Arduino development) but is this Eclipse-related at all?
Nov 09 19:36:48 <lostsoul_>	Sure, I'm just using some libraries for the atmega328p to support some I2C communications.  That's all that's Arduino.  In fact the micro is only running at 1 mip.  I've used this before without problems (not with a eclipse built library). I still is building not only in the Debug directory and in the release directory. Haven't seen that before.
Nov 09 19:38:09 <lostsoul_>	When I do a build, it looks like it's doing what it's supposed to, but then the screen clears and it shows the release build that I never use (so far.)
Nov 09 19:39:10 <lostsoul_>	The build times are the same in both debug and release...?
Nov 09 19:39:36 <lostsoul_>	?

Nov 14 14:12:40 <Smirnov>	hey I'm trying to run org.eclipse.core inside of a benchmark , but I get this error "java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to acquire application service. Ensure that the org.eclipse.core.runtime bundle is resolved and started (see config.ini)"
Nov 14 14:13:09 <Smirnov>	Is there some way to pass more debug information via system properties or similar? I don't have a config.ini in my jar
Nov 14 15:59:03 <nitind>	Smirnov: "jar", as in just the one? Most of the plug-ins' code expects to be running within an OSGI runtime.

Nov 15 07:43:01 <AndrewPRS>	Hi there everyone! I am using eclipse Mars for a big project that builds with external scripts. The project compiles outside of eclipse with gcc 5.3 and has c++11 features. Eclipse marks a lot of c++11 features as errors. I've tried setting macro __cplusplus to 201103L  but it doesn't work. What can I do?
Nov 15 07:45:09 <mbooth>	AndrewPRS: Did you check the FAQs? https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/FAQ#CDT_does_not_recognize_C.2B.2B11_features
Nov 15 07:46:56 <AndrewPRS>	mbooth, yeah I have tried that as well
Nov 15 07:47:10 <AndrewPRS>	I think that the issue is that Eclipse doesn't know how to build the project
Nov 15 07:47:18 <AndrewPRS>	because it's not built with standard makefiles
Nov 15 07:47:29 <AndrewPRS>	it's built with custom complex build scripts
Nov 15 08:04:13 <AndrewPRS>	I solved it! :D  I had to add -std=c++0x and change to gcc 5.3
Nov 15 09:46:13 <jajavoli>	Hi everyone. I tried to update my Mylyn plugins on my Mac install of Neon.1, but the updates to the Mylyn plugins conflicted or something.
Nov 15 09:46:23 <jajavoli>	I put the details on my universally panned SuperUser thread: https://superuser.com/questions/1144097/why-cant-i-update-mylyn-task-list-in-eclipse
Nov 15 09:46:36 <jajavoli>	What would you suggest, #eclipse?

Nov 15 10:09:23 <julius_>	when i start my dynamic web project i get: WARNING: [SetPropertiesRule]{Server/Service/Engine/Host/Context} Setting property 'source' to 'org.eclipse.jst.jee.server:first-jsf' did not find a matching property.       what is it telling me?
Nov 15 10:21:00 <chibby0ne>	Hey guys, any of you ever gotten java.lang.RuntimeException: Bundle com.bundlegroup.bundlename is not found error when running JUnit tests with Maven/Tycho? The pom file, the manifest file, everything seems in order. The problem when it is getting invoked for running the tests (the plugin I'm using is tycho-surefire-plugin)
Nov 15 10:21:32 <chibby0ne>	Every other goal seems to run ok...
Nov 15 10:39:43 <jajavoli>	Here is the pastebin for the Mylyn update issue I mentioned earlier: http://pastebin.com/LAvSN70f
Nov 15 10:57:41 <jajavoli>	Never mind, I decided to just reinstall eclipse from scratch. :/
Nov 15 10:59:01 <jajavoli>	Bye everyone
Nov 15 12:03:36 <chibby0ne>	apparently what was needed was org.hamcrest in the MANIFEST.MF, as org.mockito depends on it and this was only shown when building with mvn -X -e. Otherwise it was informing that my plugin was not found, when in reality it was org.mockito that couldn't be loaded
Nov 15 12:06:32 <chibby0ne>	Funny thing was that as a JUnit Test Launch configuration it ran perfectly fine without specifying it in the MANIFEST.MF
Nov 15 19:19:10 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I have a Raspberry Pi.  I've loaded it with Java 8 and Eclipse 3.8 .. and I'm now trying to find SWT for this platform.
Nov 15 19:20:20 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I made the mistake of following one found-on-the-net suggestion and git'd a huge pile of code that turned out to be the entire git repository for SWT.
Nov 15 19:20:59 <Frigid_Cryotank>	For which, in my great ignorance, didn't seem to provide a method of compiling the version I was looking for.
Nov 15 19:24:56 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Might someone point me in the direction of an SWT package for the Raspberry Pi 2 ?
Nov 16 03:49:59 <lolek>	hello everybody, I've got a situation with CDT it seems that content assist stopped working with c+= types
Nov 16 03:50:04 <lolek>	*c++ types
Nov 16 03:50:29 <lolek>	call hierarchy, finding references, all works properly it's just when i press ctrl + space.. the popup is empty
Nov 16 04:13:40 <Artej>	Hi guys
Nov 16 04:14:04 <Artej>	I just found the solution myself :(
Nov 16 05:23:57 <mistria>	Artej: as this channel is logged, please post the solution as well, so it may be found by someone else later
Nov 16 05:27:50 <Artej>	There is a problem with GO language plugin, goclipse, basicaly it bricks the Eclipse settings: if you open settings you are stuck on Go binaries configuration because of the error on other tab (one of the fields is not set). The solution to this is to uncheck the checkbox for finding 'gofmt' from GOROOT. In addition the name is misleading as well -- the error message talks about 'local' GOROOT var
Nov 16 05:28:26 <Artej>	it is a workaround realy to be able to correct the empty field problem
Nov 16 05:29:48 <Artej>	although having a protection from such stuff in eclipse would be good
Nov 16 05:42:52 <mistria>	ArtejL: I'm not aware of any Go developer on this channel, you should open issues against GoClipse GitHub repo if you want to report bug or get assistance

Nov 16 16:58:53 <jeen>	about 6 of us I think, 7 if you count me.
Nov 16 17:00:20 <nitind>	conducting a poll?
Nov 16 17:09:44 <lftdni>	yeah make a pool
Nov 16 17:09:57 <lftdni>	what do you think about it
Nov 16 17:10:30 <lftdni>	my company is at starting point of integration
Nov 16 17:10:48 <davidmichaelkarr>	lftdni: Best to use the latest, if you have a choice.

Nov 16 17:46:59 <ke4nhw>	I have been trying to find this in the documentation anywhere. I am using Eclipse Neon.1 for Windows 7 64bit with Subversive Plugin (installed from within Eclipse). Somewhere I remember seeing a setup tutorial that
Nov 16 17:47:08 <jeen>	did I miss the memo? when did the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) get replaced/renamed to Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)?
Nov 16 17:47:59 <ke4nhw>	that mentioned the Preferences > Team > SVN > Properties Configuration and adding usernames and email there
Nov 16 17:48:24 <ke4nhw>	I cannot find that document again and I cannot find it anywhere in the Eclipse Subversive documentation
Nov 16 17:48:56 <ke4nhw>	I do know that the File > Team does not exist in the menu and I am wondering what I have missed and where.
Nov 16 18:20:19 <ke4nhw>	For lack of better options I've completely removed subversive and all its plugins, will give this another shot to see if I get the same results.
Nov 16 18:27:56 <eejee>	Hello

Nov 16 18:27:57 <ke4nhw>	Okay I've uninstalled and attempting to reinstall. Subversive SVN Team Provider is not on the list for Neon - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon under Collaboration. I have searched with a filter and without a filter by hand manually line by line. The Team Provider Sources is there, but that's not the same.
Nov 16 18:31:15 <ke4nhw>	Okay change of tack, I unchecked Hide items that are already installed, and Team Provider is there. I attempted to uninstall it. Well, I'll give it another go, but I'm quickly starting to wonder if Eclipse Neon.1 for Windows 7 64bit plays well with Subversion or if it favors git by means of complication.
Nov 16 18:31:18 <nitind>	Searched using what?
Nov 16 18:31:44 <ke4nhw>	Install Software > Collaboration Section
Nov 16 18:31:59 <ke4nhw>	I have it now but I had to uncheck the box for items already installed
Nov 16 18:32:44 <ke4nhw>	I'm going to give it another go with Team Provider and Revision Graph
Nov 16 18:37:19 <ke4nhw>	Now if I can just get the prompt to install connectors I'll be one step closer to right back where I started
Nov 16 18:45:16 <ke4nhw>	As far as connectors go is it better to go svn kit or native javaHL?
Nov 16 18:51:56 <ke4nhw>	Or can I just install them all and choose later?
Nov 16 20:34:49 <metaf5_>	Hi, I'm having trouble where non-networked installations of Eclipse hang for a couple minutes the first time you run a java program.  Networked machines don't have this hang.  Any ideas what setting I might need to mess with to stop this from happening?
Nov 16 20:35:28 <metaf5_>	I'm also curious what exactly Eclipse is trying to do at this point.  Seems like it's looking for something online and hanging the UI thread while the connection times out.
Nov 17 03:23:23 <barq>	How can I access the marketplace through a proxy? I tried native, manual and direct, none of them work?
Nov 17 03:23:27 <barq>	Eclipse neon

Nov 17 21:50:15 <Frigid_Cryotank>	On a Raspberry Pi I've managed to install Java 8, Eclipse 3.8, and I've got a working SWT.  What I'm missing is the javadocs that go along with SWT.
Nov 17 21:50:40 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Following the directions at the bottom of this ( https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/367519/ ) post...
Nov 17 21:50:53 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I'm trying to create the Javadocs for this swt.
Nov 17 21:51:44 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I've found the src.zip file within the downloaded archive.
Nov 17 21:51:59 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Unzipped that and found the org directory.
Nov 17 21:53:06 <Frigid_Cryotank>	And, neophyte that I am, the next step slows me down.
Nov 17 21:53:21 <Frigid_Cryotank>	I have an existing project within Eclipse named "First".
Nov 17 21:53:38 <Frigid_Cryotank>	First has a src directory.
Nov 17 21:54:14 <Frigid_Cryotank>	so I move org to First/src then start Eclipse running
Nov 17 21:54:53 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Eclipse "sees" the org directory.  Per the instructions I highlight the org entry in First then navigate to Project --> Generate Javadocs
Nov 17 21:55:37 <Frigid_Cryotank>	The only thing that shows up in the next popup is First... and that's not what I'm looking for.
Nov 17 21:56:08 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Uh.. help?  I don't know enough about Eclipse to make sense of the instructions.
Nov 17 23:54:25 <hanshenrik>	i think i found an eclipse C bug, with #include <assert.h> , eclipse thinks this is a syntax error. gcc doesn't. http://paste.debian.net/896515/
Nov 17 23:56:04 <hanshenrik>	C11 target
Nov 18 00:32:24 <jeen>	I’m no C coder but it’s possible of course. have a look in the bug tracker, see if it’s a known issue. if not, file a bug report

Nov 18 05:46:06 <julius_>	i downloaded eclipse ee for web developers, yet i cannot import javax.faces, package faces does not exist. what jar do i need to add?
Nov 18 05:50:33 <mbooth>	julius_: The javax.faces package is not part of the JavaSE standard library. It is an external lib that you either have to download and add to your project, or declare it as a dependency of your project, depending on your build system. For maven/gradle/etc: http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.glassfish%7Cjavax.faces%7C2.2.14%7Cjar

Nov 18 16:29:46 <sl4v3>	huh. nm.
Nov 18 16:35:26 <sl4v3>	is there anyway to turn off the 80 char max width for the code formatter?
Nov 18 17:50:18 <jeen>	sl4v3: yes. just edit the code formatter profile, find the ‘ine wrapping’ tab. you can set the max width to any width you like.
Nov 18 18:47:20 <iralmi>	hello, I have a question regarding spelling dictionary. Everytime I add a new word, it requires me to restart the Eclipse to recognize the new word, is there anyway to add new word without restarting eclipse?

Nov 19 13:50:02 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Is Eclipse Oxygen M3 a later release of Eclipse than Neon.1 ?
Nov 19 14:33:21 <Frigid_Cryotank>	<sigh>  Just thought to search for "Eclipse Oxygen".  Oxygen M3 is a "Milestone"... not a "release".
Nov 19 16:27:27 <tokam>	It were cool if the debugger could undo a null pointer exception and keep the programm in the state it was at the line which caused the exception
Nov 19 16:27:29 <tokam>	is that posisble

Nov 19 17:27:28 <tokam>	"Because delete operationS are immediately executed, this is considered as useless"
Nov 19 17:28:51 <davidmichaelkarr>	tokam: hard to tell from the scope, but probably should be "they are considered to be useless".
Nov 19 17:29:37 <tokam>	is the expression: "are considered useless" technically wrong?
Nov 19 17:30:43 <tokam>	I am asking because it feels a little odd, and I know where it comes from... my brain soaked it up from my universities textbooks which are not written by native speakers, and full of mistakes.
Nov 19 17:34:19 <tokam>	sorry

Do I have to activate it somehow?
Nov 20 12:18:50 <krishna_>	Hello everyone
Nov 20 12:18:58 <krishna_>	I have developed an eclipse rcp application and a plugin for it.
Nov 20 12:19:08 <krishna_>	when i run application from eclipse the plugin is being detected
Nov 20 12:19:18 <krishna_>	but when i generate jar of that plugin and place it in dropin of that rcp, the plugin is not getting detected
Nov 20 12:19:26 <krishna_>	can some one please help me to solve the issue
Nov 20 12:25:26 <mvvvv>	krishna_, not sure but I think you need to create an update site : http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp
Nov 20 12:27:00 <krishna_>	mvvvv, thanks for the reply. But my application doesnt have a view for that, but generally the plugins in the dropins folder should get detected automatically
Nov 20 12:28:52 <mvvvv>	this ? : http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fmisc%2Fp2_dropins_format.html
Nov 20 12:29:10 <krishna_>	will there be any configuration required or rcp build or something so that it can load plugins from dropins? If i mention the plugin name in the bundles.info that is getting loaded or else its not.
Nov 20 12:30:14 <krishna_>	mvvvv yes followed that
Nov 20 12:30:40 <krishna_>	i guess i'm missing something in the configuration of my main RCP application
Nov 20 12:31:10 <mvvvv>	so you have to drop the jar in the directory .../eclipse/dropins
Nov 20 12:32:13 <krishna_>	yes, but after dropping it into that directory, my RCP application is not recognizing it, even after restart of the application, when i debug its showing that found something interesting ......
Nov 20 12:33:22 <krishna_>	i'm stuck here it would be helpful if someone helps me out in solving this issue
Nov 20 12:43:57 <krishna_>	mvvvv, i'm using eclipse mars, does this have any bug related to dropins?
Nov 20 13:09:58 <mvvvv>	krishna_, sorry I don't know
Nov 20 13:10:24 <krishna_>	its ok mvvvv thanks for the try :)

Nov 21 18:37:46 <josteele>	is there an Eclipse framework for helping with starting/stoping and interacting with external processes? I'm shipping a jar with my plugins that I'd like to start as a separate process
Nov 21 18:39:17 <nitind>	Just JDT debugging and launching plug-ins, afaik.
Nov 21 19:56:53 <black13>	can eclipse be copied from one machine to another
Nov 21 19:57:35 <black13>	that is i have computer that is in a secure location and i want to "eclipse" on to that machine
Nov 21 19:58:45 <davidmichaelkarr>	black13: You can copy the installer, but copying the installation itself or the workspace isn't a good idea.  Still not sure what you mean by "eclipse on to that machine".
Nov 21 19:59:50 <black13>	i am work for a company that will allow me to install eclipse from a zip file but for some reason it blocks installation of tools from the eclipse marketplace
Nov 21 20:01:18 <davidmichaelkarr>	black13: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20970948/how-can-i-download-an-eclipse-plugin-as-a-zip-archive-using-an-update-site
Nov 21 20:05:21 <surial>	black13: you should be able to just zip up an eclipse install and move it on over.
Nov 21 20:05:34 <surial>	It's not exactly the common way to do it, but I'm pretty sure that will just work. Did you try it?
Nov 21 20:05:48 <black13>	i am going to try
Nov 21 20:06:02 <black13>	i am on osx
Nov 21 20:06:56 <surial>	oh, you want to zip up an osx install eclipse and move it to linux or what not? That's.. less likely to work.
Nov 21 20:07:18 <black13>	from osx to osx
Nov 21 20:07:27 <black13>	same version of the os as well.
Nov 22 05:07:17 <lolek>	helo everybody... egit question, hope it's correct channel, I'm trying to find a way to search something in the git history as following: filter author by name and filter commit message by something different, how to do this?
Nov 22 05:23:24 <mbooth>	lolek: Might be easier to do from command line, e.g.: git log --author="Jon" | grep "stuff"
Nov 22 05:24:39 <lolek>	mbooth: well... then why we need egit at all?
Nov 22 05:25:01 <lolek>	mbooth: or any other git gui client.. it seems that there's no single one git gui client capable of doing this
Nov 22 05:26:42 <mbooth>	lolek: You might be able to do it with egit, I don't know -- I'm sharing with you a solution that works for me :-/
Nov 22 05:27:03 <lolek>	mbooth: yeah I know that solution but it's very very very unhdany :/
Nov 22 05:27:06 <lolek>	*unhandy
Nov 22 05:27:28 <lolek>	the prob is that you'll only get list of commits and you're unable to quicly preview changes
Nov 22 05:27:37 <lolek>	not to mention view files for each specific commit
Nov 22 05:27:44 <lolek>	you need to issues another command and another and another
Nov 22 05:28:54 <lolek>	it's been already a hmm year or two, and it seems nothing changed... so I've got better solution for this but it's .. stupid that I have to use hg gui tools to use git
Nov 22 05:29:22 <mbooth>	lolek: Did you file a bug or rfe in bugzilla?
Nov 22 05:29:37 <lolek>	tbh I'm not sure, probably
Nov 22 05:30:16 <mbooth>	So your choices are: (A) keep complaining here or (B) petition the project commiters to fix your bug ;-)
Nov 22 05:32:15 <lolek>	mbooth: ehh... well I'll check if I did fillup a bug I recall I did for sure for smartgit and gitg not sure about egit
Nov 22 09:17:46 <chele>	can i have a project which has components hosted in different servers/repos? If so, any guides or tutorial?
Nov 22 10:07:14 <mistria>	chele: yes, each of your component should be a separate Eclipse project though (still in the same workspace)
Nov 22 14:37:19 <iralmi>	hello, I have a question regarding spelling dictionary. Everytime I add a new word, it requires me to restart the Eclipse to recognize the new word, is there anyway to add new word without restarting eclipse?
Nov 22 16:11:47 <jeen>	iralmi: it shouldn’t be doing that at all. you just need to configure a file for user-specific dictionary (once), but even that doesn’t require a restart.
Nov 23 07:21:41 <chibby0ne>	Hey guys, I'm having an issue with JGit in Unit tests in a Maven Build, where I get an exception with message: cannot open git-upload-pack. The funny thing is that it works as a JUnit Plugin from Eclipse, but it fails as a maven build. I'm behind a proxy, so I've setted up MAVEN_OPTS, as well as http.sslVerify false in git config, which were listed in some SO answers as fixing it, I'vd also tried passing the parameters for the JVM directly. Any
Nov 23 07:21:41 <chibby0ne>	clues?
Nov 23 08:40:39 <mistria>	chibby0ne: check whether an important bundle could be missing in the target environment. With Tycho, you can see the list of bundles that are used for test in <test>/target/work/configuration/config.ini
Nov 23 08:41:06 <mistria>	chibby0ne: if tests use a remote repository, I'd look for some bundles related to .net, .ssl, .ecf...

Nov 23 18:48:27 <iralmi>	What is the shortcut key to switch from "Java Editor" to "Project Explorer"?
Nov 23 18:49:14 <iralmi>	Similiarly, what is the shortcut key to switch from "Java Editor" to "JUnit" view?
Nov 23 18:52:56 <davidmichaelkarr>	iralmi: Most of those transitions aren't bound by default to a key.  However, you may be able to configure that yourself.  Go to Preferences and "Keys" and enter "Show View" in the filter.  You'll see that most of those have an empty "Binding" column.  You could add your own binding.  If you do that, make sure you use a prefix that is not bound to anything
Nov 23 18:52:56 <davidmichaelkarr>	else.  I bind lots of things that I use a lot using a "ctrl+;" (ctrl-semicolon) multi-key prefix. It's possible those bindings won't work, but it's worth a try. It's always better to use keys instead of mouse movements to move around, if possible.
Nov 23 18:54:26 <davidmichaelkarr>	iralmi: Obviously, those functions don't care where you're coming FROM, but that might be obvious.

Nov 23 20:25:28 <rockstar_>	davidmichaelkarr: I guess so, but it is LTS version.
Nov 23 20:27:12 <davidmichaelkarr>	rockstar_: that mostly means that ubuntu itself will work. There's no way they could guarantee that all the apps you run on it would work.
Nov 23 20:27:45 <rockstar_>	davidmichaelkarr: I see, but it was working fine yesterday. Now it's evening not opening up
Nov 23 20:33:09 <davidmichaelkarr>	rockstar_: you def need to turn off gtk3, but that may not fix that particular problem.
Nov 23 20:40:47 <TheChubu>	GTK3 still sucks for me, even in neon.
Nov 23 20:43:35 <davidmichaelkarr>	The very first thing to do with ubuntu (and derivs) and eclipse, is turning off gtk3. I'll be glad to hear when that's not needed anymore.

Nov 28 09:07:07 <anyhowput>	hi guys, is there any plugins to download to eclipse (helios) to view erd extension file?
Nov 28 09:07:24 <anyhowput>	i am trying to view er diagrams but when i click on the erd extension file it gives me codes instead of the diagram.
Nov 28 09:59:48 <yocs0000>	hi everybody. I have installed eclipse modelling tools using the installer. I instlled in /opt/ into a directory where I gave the user rights to read and write.
Nov 28 09:59:52 <yocs0000>	If I launch eclipse, and install a plugin, for example BPMN2 Modeller, it does install it in the user directory instead that in /opt/. Why? How can I solve the issue?
Nov 28 10:00:03 <yocs0000>	I have looked on the documntation, but I do not seem to find a solution.
Nov 28 10:01:34 <mbooth>	yocs0000: This is by design -- user-installed plugins are for the user. If you want the plug-in to be available for all users, you can use the "dropins" mechanism
Nov 28 10:05:32 <mbooth>	yocs0000: http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fmisc%2Fp2_dropins_format.html
Nov 28 11:03:04 <yocs0000>	mbooth: thnks, but should the installtion not put those plugins into the dropin? how to I make a plugin into a dropin?
Nov 28 11:03:15 <yocs0000>	mbooth: we cannot ask all users to install the same plugin.
Nov 28 11:04:18 <yocs0000>	mbooth: for example, how do I do that with BPMN2 modeller?
Nov 28 11:05:28 <mbooth>	yocs0000: You just download the thing you want and drop the plugins and features into the dropins directory, see the directory layout in the link I gave you.
Nov 28 11:09:47 <yocs0000>	thank you I will try .... I have installed the plugin using the updae repository. So I copy the content from the local user directory to opt?
Nov 28 12:01:57 <yocs0000>	mbooth: I cannot see to udnerstand how to transform a plugin into a dropin .... would it not be better if the installer allowed you to install dropins?
Nov 28 12:06:37 <mbooth>	yocs0000: Well, no. Users shouldn't be able to affect other users on the system (imagine if what you want were possible-- one user could screw up the eclipse installation for all other users on the system) -- so user-installed plugins have to necessarily only be for that user otherwise you break your system's security model.
Nov 28 12:09:42 <yocs0000>	mbooth: no, I mean the central installer .... eclipse-installer ....
Nov 28 12:10:10 <yocs0000>	mbooth: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Installer
Nov 28 12:11:04 <yocs0000>	mbooth: if the administrator does not want the users to install centrally, they will put some restriction .... the problem here is that you cannot chose to install in the central directory even if you have the rights to do so
Nov 28 12:11:16 <yocs0000>	mbooth: it is a useless complication
Nov 28 12:12:18 <mbooth>	yocs0000: You said "If I launch eclipse, and install a plugin" <-- So this does not mean through Help->Install new software ?
Nov 28 12:13:28 <yocs0000>	mbooth: I mean tht the ony way at the moment to install a plugin is to "Help->Install new software", but if I do that then it is not centrally available. I cannot find a way of installing centrally using the graphical installer.
Nov 28 12:15:27 <mbooth>	yocs0000: Hence my "dropins" suggestion -- you can literally unzip some p2 repository in your dropins directory and it will be available to all users...
Nov 28 12:16:36 <yocs0000>	mbooth: but the "BPMN2 modeller" does not provide the zipped files, you can ony access it through the update site as far as I know .... and installing and unzipping manually does not use the grphical installer.
Nov 28 12:17:49 <mbooth>	yocs0000: That project does not provide a zipped p2 repository download? That's annoying. You can still download all the plugins: http://download.eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler/updates/neon/1.3.0/plugins/?d
Nov 28 12:19:52 <yocs0000>	mbooth: .... "This page is not designed to be web-accessible, as the project has not created a web page here."
Nov 28 12:20:29 <mbooth>	Yes... It is the p2 update site.
Nov 28 12:20:46 <yocs0000>	mbooth: I think the problem here is that if the update website are the preferred installtion approach (remember that unzipping plugins in the directory seems to be deprecated) then the graphical installer should allow you to centrally install if you have permissions.
Nov 28 12:22:16 <rgrunber>	it's not recommended to run Eclipse as root (the logical necessity for this to work), strange things happen.
Nov 28 12:24:30 <yocs0000>	rgrunber: exactly .... so to install centrally, the only option you have is to use a deprectaed approach .... sounds cotradictory to me but I could be wrong mbooth
Nov 28 12:24:43 <mbooth>	yocs0000: A working solution is usually better than a preferred solution that does not work ;-)
Nov 28 12:25:19 <rgrunber>	but the amount of extra work required to get those plugins part of the installation shared by all is not that much extra. i mean if you have permissions extracting those jars/features is an acceptable workaround for lack of support directly to the update site
Nov 28 12:25:41 <yocs0000>	mbooth: yes, of course, still no great though .... when the sysadmin changes, how do they know what you have done?
Nov 28 12:25:53 <yocs0000>	rgrunber: and you have lost me completely there ....
Nov 28 12:26:47 <mbooth>	yocs0000: That's a different problem -- your sysadmin should be using some reproducible method to deploy systems (chef, puppet, kickstart, whatever)
Nov 28 12:27:40 <yocs0000>	mbooth: chef or kickstart to deploy 1 plugin on eclipse?!
Nov 28 12:27:58 <yocs0000>	mbooth: flipping heck, it is like shooting a fly with a nuke
Nov 28 12:28:09 <mbooth>	yocs0000: No, you miss the point :-/
Nov 28 12:28:28 <mbooth>	yocs0000: You talk about sysadmins.... So I guess this is large scale deployment?
Nov 28 12:29:58 <yocs0000>	mbooth: no, not really .... it is on two machines, used by a series of users with their login credentials. The issue here is that if you create an installer, and then you deprecate manul install, and then the only way to install is manual, then you are looking for troubles.
Nov 28 12:30:44 <yocs0000>	mbooth: but I may be wrong .... of course, we had installtion issues with eclipse sice early days .... it would be nice if they were sorted onc and for all.
Nov 28 12:30:45 <mbooth>	yocs0000: Reproducibly deploying a system (necessary in the case of changing sysadmin, which you mentioned) is a different problem that is out of the scope of this channel
Nov 28 12:31:50 <yocs0000>	mbooth: not really, again. The sysadmin also has to maintain specialised machines like the two machine running eclipse. Unless you consider two large scale deployment.
Nov 28 12:34:32 <mbooth>	yocs0000: You asked me "How would they know what you have done?" if you don't automate things, I guess you have to write it down then :-)
Nov 28 12:35:18 <yocs0000>	mbooth: unless the graphical installer actually worked as it should of course, but hey, we can discuss all night
Nov 28 12:35:34 <yocs0000>	mbooth: anyway thank you. We will keep disagreeing in any case.
Nov 28 13:15:59 <yocs0000>	mbooth: rgrunber: I think you may be wrong  .... the graphical installer does actually allow you to install into /opt!!!! IT would have been nice if they had made it clearer int the documentation?
Nov 28 13:17:36 <rgrunber>	yocs0000: you mean oomph ?
Nov 28 13:18:07 <rgrunber>	Eclipse Installer powered by Oomph ?

Nov 28 14:35:28 <ipun>	Hi, is it possible to have Eclipse debug a child eclipse with parameters? I'm trying to debug eclipse to run like "./eclipse /some/path", but while having it hit my breakpoints
Nov 28 14:41:22 <nitind>	That's what the "Eclipse Application" launch type is for. You get that by installing the ~pde
Nov 28 14:41:22 <Arbalest>	PDE is the Plug-in Development Environment (PDE). Included in the Eclipse SDK and the Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers, it helps with writing, testing, debugging, and packaging plug-ins for Eclipse and OSGi frameworks. See https://www.eclipse.org/pde/ .
Nov 28 15:21:44 <ipun>	nitind: I think i've been actually using that to run my child eclipses. However, I'm looking at the "arguments" section of it and figuring out if its something I can put there so it would use this with a path: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/OpenFileFeature

Nov 28 22:01:13 <Mahjongg>	Hi, I ran a java console app in Neon. i lost connection to X, I can access shell though. Is there a way to check console log without X access?
Nov 29 12:29:17 <access_control>	Hi to all. I have Eclipce c++ neon. There is a possibility to export CDT User Setting Entries. But how to import them from an other project?
Nov 29 12:31:56 <access_control>	***Eclipse C++ Neon. 1***
Nov 29 12:35:14 <mvvvv>	access_control, don't you have an Import Wizard ? C++ Project Setting
Nov 29 12:37:32 <access_control>	mvvvv: I have. But through this wizard I can import just include paths and symbols, which i can import by simply applying project reference.
Nov 29 12:39:49 <mvvvv>	This ? http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftimpandexp.htm
Nov 29 12:45:42 <access_control>	Just tried. CDT User Setting Entries are not imported.
Nov 29 12:48:00 <access_control>	In the settings tab, where CDT User Setting Entries appear, there is a button "Export". But I look a lot of different tutorials, there is not such button on the screenshots.
Nov 29 12:48:37 <mvvvv>	And don't you have import near this one ?
Nov 29 12:49:34 <access_control>	Of course not.
Nov 29 12:51:21 <access_control>	The purpose of this button is to mark the CDT User Setting Entries as exported.  If I reference this project from an other project, these setting should be imported, with includes, libs etc.
Nov 29 12:51:50 <access_control>	Everything is imported except CDT User Setting Entries.
Nov 29 12:59:04 <access_control>	I get a lot of errors but building is successful.
Nov 29 12:59:40 <access_control>	In order to feed the indexer I need this settings.
Nov 29 13:02:32 <access_control>	Ok. A work around is to use the build output parser, after successful building.
Nov 29 13:03:21 <access_control>	May be this is a bug.
Nov 30 07:39:40 <metrixx>	hi.
Nov 30 07:40:16 <metrixx>	how can i see the existing server full detailed configuration?
Nov 30 07:41:36 <mvvvv>	metrixx open the view "server" ?
Nov 30 07:49:50 <metrixx>	mvvvv, i see a server project in package explorer but how can i see it in server view?
Nov 30 07:50:49 <mvvvv>	metrix : http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-9f.htm
Nov 30 07:52:40 <mvvvv>	metrixx, then you'll get this : http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.wst.server.ui.doc.user%2Ftopics%2Frwrcview.html
Nov 30 07:53:34 <metrixx>	i read them already but they don't answer my question
Nov 30 07:53:44 <metrixx>	mvvvv, i have an open server view already but the problem is, i can't show the server project that is in package explorer in the server view
Nov 30 07:54:20 <mvvvv>	metrixx, what is the server you're using ?
Nov 30 07:54:43 <metrixx>	tomcat 8
Nov 30 07:54:50 <metrixx>	wait, i'll show a screenshot
Nov 30 08:00:14 <metrixx>	http://pasteboard.co/4amaQbYyM.jpg
Nov 30 08:00:39 <metrixx>	i want to see the server which is in package explorer on servers view
Nov 30 08:02:56 <mvvvv>	what do you mean "to see" ? to launch it ? to monitor it ?
Nov 30 08:03:31 <metrixx>	to monitor, to start and stop
Nov 30 08:04:20 <mvvvv>	so with the server view you have to add a tomcat server, to start it then to publish your project to this server
Nov 30 08:08:11 <mvvvv>	and yes I do not understand why your server in servers folder is not in the Servers view
Nov 30 08:08:54 <metrixx>	:))))
Nov 30 08:08:58 <metrixx>	i think i found the reason
Nov 30 08:09:33 <metrixx>	i think i just backup them before.. and they are just the configuration file of the previously created tomcat server
Nov 30 08:10:00 <metrixx>	because i created new server and checked the .metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\tmp0 folder to see content
Nov 30 08:10:26 <metrixx>	what i see in package explorer is just conf files of an old server
Nov 30 08:10:28 <mvvvv>	right this is only a copy of the configuration files
Nov 30 08:10:46 <metrixx>	so i can just replace  these old conf files on new server
Nov 30 08:10:55 <mvvvv>	yes
Nov 30 08:12:31 <metrixx>	and one more thing... when i delete the server i created a few minutes ago with the same name on package explorer, it deleted the old conf files too :|
Nov 30 08:12:54 <mvvvv>	same name ...
Nov 30 08:13:09 <metrixx>	yes but it shouldn't check my workspace
Nov 30 08:14:57 <mvvvv>	it should
Nov 30 08:21:50 <metrixx>	workspace\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\servers.xml
Nov 30 08:22:01 <metrixx>	found the link between directories and eclipse
Nov 30 22:52:12 <xrandr>	Hi, when eclipse compiles an app, where are the class files stored?
Nov 30 23:12:44 <davidmichaelkarr>	xrandr: usually in "bin", but you usually don't need to know that.
Nov 30 23:13:23 <davidmichaelkarr>	xrandr: build path tab of proj props sets that.
Dec 01 09:44:15 <loganrun>	anybody know why eclipse doesn't reconize some imports. I have an import sip, but it puts a red x by it and underlines it in red, but the code works
Dec 01 09:53:16 <mvvvv>	loganrun, must be the jar of this import you should add to your project path
Dec 01 10:21:35 <loganrun>	hmm added /usr/share/sip to the external libraries under properties PyDev - PYTHONPATH, but that didn't do anything
Dec 01 10:22:35 <loganrun>	says unresoved import
Dec 01 10:22:59 <loganrun>	sip Found at: 2.qwtScrollingGraph
Dec 01 10:22:59 <loganrun>	import sip
Dec 01 10:22:59 <loganrun>	――――――――――――――――
Dec 01 10:22:59 <loganrun>	Unresolved import: sip
Dec 01 10:31:37 <loganrun>	also tried adding /usr/share/sip to libraries under python interperters, but didn't fix it
Dec 01 10:57:02 <mvvvv>	loganrun, with python you should indicate PyDev -> Interpreter -Pyton to your ../site-packages/ of your python version (the one you use for test)
Dec 01 11:01:42 <Frostilicus>	Hi, there's a bug that's gone unaddressed for over 3 years and I'd like to update the fields to reflect that it still affects the latest release, how should I do that?
Dec 01 11:07:00 <mvvvv>	Frostilicus, add a comment indicating the version should be enougth
Dec 01 11:07:41 <Frostilicus>	mvvvv, okay thanks
Dec 01 12:14:52 <yocs0000>	does anyone know CMS and what template they use for http://www.eclipse.org/che/?
Dec 01 13:18:22 <metrixx_>	hi.
Dec 01 13:19:16 <metrixx_>	for example, i have 3 java files and i want to compile two of them while exporting .jar but i want to compile all of them while debugging
Dec 01 13:19:27 <metrixx_>	is there a way to make this easy like profiles etc?
Dec 01 13:19:57 <metrixx_>	i excluded a java file which is used to test other classes in a main method
Dec 01 13:20:09 <metrixx_>	but i have to include that again after each export
Dec 01 13:20:18 <metrixx_>	what is the solution for this
Dec 01 14:00:56 <NikhilMudholkar>	hi, i want to start contributing to eclipse.
Dec 01 14:01:37 <NikhilMudholkar>	i visited the eclipse developer site, but it is very confusing.
Dec 01 14:02:15 <NikhilMudholkar>	How do i find a simple bug to contribute to??
Dec 01 14:28:18 <NikhilMudholkar>	??
Dec 01 14:28:44 <NikhilMudholkar>	hi, i want to start contributing to eclipse. i visited the eclipse developer site, but it is very confusing. How do i find a simple bug to contribute to??
Dec 01 14:28:58 <ipun>	hi NikhilMudholkar you can check out https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/ for any new things to work on
Dec 01 14:37:56 <davidmichaelkarr>	NikhilMudholkar: Generally, just trying to find bugs to fix will be an ineffective approach.  A better approach is to find projects and communities to get involved with.
Dec 01 14:45:09 <NikhilMudholkar>	and how do i find projects and communities?
Dec 01 14:45:30 <NikhilMudholkar>	please help, i an kind of new to this entire thing. Thanks a ton
Dec 01 15:03:28 <NikhilMudholkar>	davidmichaelkarr: how do i find projects and communities?
Dec 01 15:04:06 <davidmichaelkarr>	NikhilMudholkar: Do you use Eclipse for any of your daily work?
Dec 01 15:04:28 <NikhilMudholkar>	yup, i use eclipse to code java
Dec 01 15:04:47 <NikhilMudholkar>	basically i use eclipse only.
Dec 01 15:05:40 <davidmichaelkarr>	NikhilMudholkar: If you actively use particular features of Eclipse, those are the portions of Eclipse that you should try to get involved with.  Go to https://www.eclipse.org/ and click on "Projects" and then "List of Projects". Those are candidates.
Dec 01 15:06:35 <NikhilMudholkar>	ok.thanks
Dec 01 21:28:49 <loganlee>	hello im trying to add appcompat-v7 external jar to library but i only have appcompat-v7-25.0.1.aar file which is not jar
Dec 01 21:57:10 <Fairy>	I might be missing something extremely obvious, but for some reason I can't get Eclipse to jump to certain private methods within a class? I seem unable to pinpoint exactly what that happens, except that they're all part of an external library and lack a associated javadoc, but this only applies to _some_ of the classes in the library...
Dec 01 22:03:22 <Fairy>	(Just to be clear, the methods are listed in Outline, I can scroll down to them in the class, they exist. But cycling through the methods, or attempting to directly navigate to them in any way is impossible - I've never encountered anything similar before...)
Dec 01 22:04:11 <davidmichaelkarr>	Fairy: what are you doing exactly that makes you think eclipse should "jump" to a method? What do you mean by "jump"?
Dec 01 22:04:50 <Fairy>	By jump i mean scroll down to the method in question, so I can read what it does
Dec 01 22:05:39 <davidmichaelkarr>	Fairy: still not making sense. Just scroll down to it.
Dec 01 22:06:33 <Fairy>	When I cycle through the methods (CTRL+SHIFT+UP/DOWN), Eclipse will go through every public method, but skip (jump over) all the private ones.
Dec 01 22:08:19 <Fairy>	I mean, that is what I'm doing, but it's a clumsy process, as there are A LOT of private methods in certain instances. I fail to understand why Eclipse appears to ignore them
Dec 01 22:10:11 <davidmichaelkarr>	Fairy: no idea what that function is you're using. There are numerous ways to navigate the class.
Dec 01 22:15:49 <Fairy>	I'm not entirely sure how to better formulate my problem. But as an example, lets say that lines 400 through line 1400 are filled with various private methods in a class. I wish to check the private int getMin() method (ie. read the code), which happens to reside somewhere between line 400 and 1400. Eclipse is perfectly capable of showing me that getMin() is located between getAvg() and getMax()  (as depicted in the class Outline), but navigating
Dec 01 22:15:49 <Fairy>	directly to said method proves moot. The only way for me to find it, is to scroll through lines 400 and 1400 until I find it.
Dec 01 22:16:23 <Fairy>	(which is obviously ridiculous)
Dec 01 22:19:05 <Fairy>	The issue is solely restricted to classes that are part of an external library (This is a Java .jar), but it doesn't apply to all classes within said library.
Dec 01 22:46:55 <davidmichaelkarr>	Fairy: what do you see with ctrl+o ?
Dec 01 22:47:37 <Fairy>	davidmichaelkarr: The list of methods. All of them. Private and Public.
Dec 01 22:48:11 <Fairy>	davidmichaelkarr: Selecting any public one will jump to it. Selecting a private will do nothing.
Dec 01 22:48:50 <Fairy>	(Well, besides highlighting it in the Outline tab)
Dec 01 22:55:02 <davidmichaelkarr>	Fairy: i'd be curious to see what the output of javap from the class file shows.
Dec 01 23:07:18 <Fairy>	davidmichaelkarr: I could give you the entire lib if you'd like (~2mb)
Dec 02 04:33:28 <Gamoder_>	Hi everyone, should it be sufficient to install Xtext to get org.eclipse.xtext.ui.editor.model.IXtextDocument in the runtime eclipse? becaues I get a Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.eclipse.xtext.ui.editor.model.IXtextDocument cannot be found by
Dec 02 05:17:31 <mvvvv>	Gamoder_, Xtext is a runtime AND a development tool. I guess you only need the runtime. When did you have this error ?
Dec 02 05:19:28 <Gamoder_>	when I started a new eclipse runtime workspace instance where I wanted to open a file for which the editor defined in the original eclipse instance should be used
Dec 02 05:23:36 <Gamoder_>	wow, now it works
Dec 02 05:23:51 <Gamoder_>	after I re-exported org.eclipse.xtext.ui in a project
Dec 02 05:24:15 <mvvvv>	what is the file type ?
Dec 02 05:25:22 <Gamoder_>	my custom file extension .service
Dec 02 05:25:26 <Gamoder_>	but it works now, thanks
Dec 02 08:53:52 <ImQ009>	Hello. I accidentally performed a git checkout on one of my local files, removing all my changes. Eclipse immediately reloaded the file without even asking me if I wanted it to do that. Is there a way to restore it?
Dec 02 08:54:03 <ImQ009>	If not, is there a way to prevent Eclipse from doing that in the future?
Dec 02 08:55:00 <ImQ009>	Ah, It's just undo. Ha.
Dec 02 09:40:23 <chele>	Hi there, can I handle several workspaces with eclipse at once, e.g. in one eclipse instance?
Dec 02 09:40:54 <chele>	The purpose is to handle a project with several components which are hosted on different servers or repos.
Dec 02 09:40:58 <MrKeuner>	hi, is there a quick way to update the javadoc portion of the code for changes in parameters, etc?
Dec 02 09:41:27 <mbooth>	chele: You can usually only have one workspace open at a time, but you can switch between them with "File->Switch workspace"
Dec 02 09:41:43 <mbooth>	chele: You can have multiple projects in a single workspace though
Dec 02 09:41:50 <chele>	mbooth aah right. thanks.
Dec 02 09:42:19 <chele>	mbooth that's true but how do you assign each project different vcs repo/server ?
Dec 02 09:42:56 <mbooth>	chele: Each project in your workspace can come from different source control repos
Dec 02 09:43:18 <mbooth>	chele: E.g., you can have as many git repositories as you like in a workspace
Dec 02 09:44:14 <chele>	mbooth this means when one project in one workspace still has several repos it cannot be done?
Dec 02 09:47:52 <mbooth>	chele: So are you using git submodules or svn externals?
Dec 02 09:51:42 <chele>	none of them.
Dec 02 09:52:16 <mbooth>	chele: Okay, well I would probably have one "eclipse project" for each component you want to work on.
Dec 02 09:54:07 <chele>	mbooth therefore if I want to have several "non-eclipse projects" (those having components hosted in different repos) in one "eclipse workspace" it cannot be done with the current eclipse approach.
Dec 02 09:55:03 <mbooth>	chele: No, I mean there is no reason why you can't have all your components in one workspace
Dec 02 09:55:54 <mbooth>	Each component would be in a different project within the workspace
Dec 02 09:56:38 <chele>	mbooth yes but the projects has likely several components
Dec 02 09:57:34 <mbooth>	chele: I mean what Eclipse calls a project would contain one of your components
Dec 02 09:58:56 <chele>	mbooth correct. so you have to use the so called switch workspace option if you wanna support this: http://paste.debian.net/900192/
Dec 02 10:01:02 <mbooth>	chele: No, just give each component it's own eclipse project like this: http://paste.debian.net/900193/
Dec 02 10:01:56 <chele>	mbooth thanks.
Dec 02 10:02:21 <chele>	is funny how you carefully use a positive vocabulary :)
Dec 02 10:02:44 <mbooth>	chele: "Project" is a super overloaded term :-)
Dec 02 10:02:56 <chele>	mbooth that's true.
Dec 02 10:08:15 <systemovich>	In terms of code formatting, specifically PHP, is it possible to have a new line inserted before the closing parenthesis of a multiline function call? I could not see any way.
Dec 02 10:08:39 <systemovich>	That is required for PSR-2.
Dec 02 10:12:23 <mbooth>	systemovich: You may need to file a bug for that https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=PDT
Dec 02 10:12:45 <systemovich>	mbooth: Ok I will. Thanks.
Dec 02 10:37:06 <taholmes160>	Good Morning to one and all
Dec 02 10:37:33 <taholmes160>	Im looking for the right package to download to do general php, html, css etc development with eclipse -- there are a bunch, and Im not sure which is the right one
Dec 02 10:37:40 <taholmes160>	can someone please point me the right way?
Dec 02 10:38:59 <mbooth>	taholmes160: Did you try the "Eclipse for PHP Developers" download on https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/ ?
Dec 02 10:39:35 <taholmes160>	Good Morning Mbooth -- I have not yet, as I was not sure if that was the appropriate one -- thanks
Dec 02 11:16:54 <Gamoder_>	Hi everyone, is there any support for "info" type messages in Java (as opposed to warnings and errors)?

Dec 06 14:02:44 <Ben_1>	I'm using an embedded jetty
Dec 06 14:03:03 <Ben_1>	My problem is that it won't show an exception but only redirects to my error page
Dec 06 14:03:19 <Ben_1>	I already set the errorHandler.setShowStacks(true);
Dec 06 14:05:32 <nitind>	Are you sure your errorHandler is the one being called?
Dec 06 14:06:39 <Ben_1>	If this is commented in "errorHandler.addErrorPage(404, errorPagePath);" I get the following line in my console: 2016-12-06 20:06:29.336:WARN:oejsh.ErrorHandler:qtp152005629-22: No error page found "/error.html"
Dec 06 14:06:48 <Ben_1>	Because I don't have a error.html file yet
Dec 06 14:07:07 <nitind>	Have you've looked at what's going on in the debugger?
Dec 06 14:07:08 <Ben_1>	but If I comment the addErrorPage function out I won't get any console output
Dec 06 14:07:14 <Ben_1>	so yes I think the errorhandler is called
Dec 06 14:08:04 <Ben_1>	nitind: I can start it in debug mode but I won't stop or something
Dec 06 14:08:15 <Ben_1>	and I don't know where I should set an breakpoint
Dec 06 14:09:09 <nitind>	Ben_1: Pick some methods in your error handler class, or in its superclasses. Set them by right-clicking on the methods in the Outline View.
Dec 06 14:09:38 <Ben_1>	nitind: I'm using a default ErrorPageErrorHandler
Dec 06 14:10:06 <Ben_1>	this class is not accessable for me
Dec 06 14:10:31 <nitind>	I don't know what that means.
Dec 06 14:10:47 <Ben_1>	org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ErrorPageErrorHandler
Dec 06 14:11:20 <nitind>	I don't know what that "not accessable for me" means.
Dec 06 14:11:31 <Ben_1>	how should I set breakpoints in this class?
Dec 06 14:11:42 <nitind>	Navigate->Open Type
Dec 06 14:12:55 <Ben_1>	oh ok for this it is working, thanks. But sometimes I can't use that because I can not open external lib classes.
Dec 06 14:13:18 <nitind>	If it's on your Java Build Path, you can open it. You may not have sources, but you can still open it and add method breakpoints.
Dec 06 14:14:48 <Ben_1>	ok thanks for that :)!
Dec 06 14:16:36 <Ben_1>	but it just passes a httprequest and not really exception information
Dec 06 14:25:43 <davidmichaelkarr>	Ben_1: if you're sitting on the bp, you can move up the callstack and perhaps find a catch clause that it's called from.

Dec 07 08:01:58 <rivarun>	hello!
Dec 07 08:03:25 <rivarun>	i would like to make errors more obvious in the text area. namely "C/C++ Indexer Markers" under General>Editors>TextEditors>Annotations. there doesn't seem to be a way to change from "Squiggly Line", which is practically invisible to me. is there anything else i can do? the marker on the ruler tells me nothing about the location of the problem
Dec 07 08:10:48 <mbooth>	anton-jo1ansson: Just ask your question -- hopefully someone will know the answer
Dec 07 08:43:11 <anton-jo1ansson>	Allright, mbooth!
Dec 07 08:44:57 <anton-jo1ansson>	When working with debug launchers, I can use variables such as ${project_loc:my-other-project} in a lot of places. However, not when working with attached sources. I have very generic Maven launchers in a separate project that can be used with a bunch of other projects, but I need to attach sources dynamically from the project that is executing the Maven launcher. Can't seem to do that using
Dec 07 08:45:03 <anton-jo1ansson>	variables. :( Anyone know why? Or maybe I'm just doing it wrong.

Dec 08 11:26:16 <nicoulaj>	nitind: downloaded oxygen M3, doesn't start because SWT requires libc 2.14 http://pastebin.com/Ez9GcKiz
Dec 08 11:27:27 <nitind>	Well, like the page says. It's being tested on 7.

Dec 08 11:32:55 <lmici>	any one uses the dark theme?
Dec 08 12:19:56 <rivarun>	is it possible to have eclipse build on its own so as to update the Problems pane and indicators more often?
Dec 08 12:20:29 <rivarun>	(that is, without auto-save)
Dec 08 12:22:29 <rivarun>	actually, it looks like even if i enable auto-build and auto-save, it still doesn't always build
Dec 08 12:46:21 <rivarun>	lmici: i was experimenting with it earlier, why?
Dec 08 14:38:36 <nitind>	rivarun: What is it not building as expected?
Dec 08 15:21:48 <upgrdman_>	when you highlight a word in the edit, it will highlight all other occurrances of it, and draw little rectangle in the scroll bar at those location. can the color of those scroll mark rectangle markers be changed?
Dec 08 15:22:07 <upgrdman_>	*scroll bar rectangle markers
Dec 08 15:22:52 <nitind>	Sure, but it's the same color in both places. Check your "Annotations" preference page and the entry for Occurrences.
Dec 08 15:24:47 <upgrdman_>	ahh perfect, thanks!
Dec 08 16:15:39 <upgrdman_>	when using eclipse with java, it will recommend possible variable names or method names when you Ctrl-Space. is there something similar for enums when using eclipse for c? e.g. if i made a function call, and one of the arguments is an enum, is there a way to get a list of those possible enum values? Ctrl-space doesn't seem to do it for C.
Dec 08 16:23:40 <rivarun>	nitind: with auto-build enabled and auto-save set to 1, try writing this program: `int main() {return 0;}`. build. now add `foo()` before `return`. eclipse auto-saves but now it doesn't build so no errors are reported
Dec 08 16:44:29 <rivarun>	that is, it doesn't seem to build the project
Dec 08 16:51:54 <nitind>	what language is that?
Dec 08 17:04:52 <rivarun>	in a C project

Dec 13 05:08:33 <m15k>	Hej! I'm playing around with Oomph. I already defined a product and a project. Now I would like to provide an Installer which only provides these files. It's quite hard for me to find information on that topic. I already found that there's a "Oomph's Eclipse Installer" but I can't find information what the "oomph.product.update.url" should provide.
Dec 13 08:39:11 <julius>	hi
Dec 13 08:39:11 <Arbalest>	Welcome! If you have a question, just ask, or take a look at our FAQ - http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ :) Try typing ~faq to see more FAQs! If you have errors or logs to show, see ~pastebin. If you have screenshots to share, see ~image. You need to describe your problem in detail,so  please provide some ~info about your setup.

Dec 13 08:39:34 <julius>	in a dynamic web project, where do i put javascripts and how do i link to them in my html?
Dec 13 08:40:10 <julius>	under javascript resources i got three sub "dirs"
Dec 13 08:49:00 <mvvvv>	julius, what about WebContent ? I'm not sure but the wizard to create a new javascript or html file should help you. The link is done with the html <SCRIPT> node
Dec 13 08:50:25 <m15k>	Anyone played around with eclipse oomph? I currently try to append my products to eclipse installer (or create an entire installer for our project)
Dec 13 08:52:11 <mvvvv>	m15k, do you have an Eclipse Update Site for your product ?
Dec 13 08:53:18 <m15k>	mvvvv, currently not. I saw that it seems that there's a mechanism to override the setup location.
Dec 13 08:54:02 <m15k>	I host them in out internal BitBucket, but it seems that these overwriting thing is outdated or I'm too stupid to use it.
Dec 13 08:56:23 <julius>	mvvvv, never mind got it
Dec 13 08:56:36 <julius>	mvvvv, just never really worked with javascript
Dec 13 09:01:43 <julius>	mvvvv, so easy if you got the first steps...i love eclipse :)
Dec 13 09:07:22 <julius>	is it possible to have eclipse transfer files to a remote host and have tomcat run there?  to save cpu cycles on my laptop
Dec 13 09:12:11 <m15k>	julius, https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/filesync#group-details
Dec 13 09:13:12 <m15k>	But I think this will just work if you mount youre remote location
Dec 13 09:27:52 <julius>	i could do that, let me see

Dec 13 14:36:32 <ipun>	hi which feature/method is called when you are dragging around tabs and a black outline of how the tabs will look after dropping?
Dec 13 17:02:32 <laidback_01>	say, uh... I'm running FreeBSD.  I see download links for Windows, Linux, Mac.  Okay, I was expecting something that would just be a jar or set of jar files... is that gone?
Dec 13 19:12:31 <davidmichaelkarr>	I'm seeing an odd situation where the eclipse compiler suddenly decided to act like a java 5 compiler, rejecting @Override on implemented methods defined in an interface. The project "JDK Compliance" clearly says it's using Java 8. Command line build is fine.
Dec 13 20:21:19 <rustPushmaster>	does anyone know a shortcut that will do a similar thing in eclipse as in vim as "zt", "zz" and "zb"?
Dec 13 21:26:16 <mjkr>	does eclipse has a style guide?
Dec 13 21:43:06 <davidmichaelkarr>	rustPushmaster: you might get a better response if you said what those do.
Dec 13 21:43:34 <rustPushmaster>	davidmichaelkarr, sorry
Dec 13 21:43:46 <rustPushmaster>	zt brings up whatever line your cursor is on to the top of the editor
Dec 13 21:43:55 <rustPushmaster>	zz brings it to the middle and zb to the bottom
Dec 13 21:44:29 <rustPushmaster>	kinda like if you were scrolling with you mouse all the way down till the line is at the top when doing zt,
Dec 13 21:44:40 <rustPushmaster>	to the middle when doing zz and to the bottom when doing zb
Dec 13 21:45:22 <rustPushmaster>	vim handles blank lines by filling out lines that have no text or edits with a ~ at the beginning of each line
Dec 13 21:45:36 <rustPushmaster>	however in eclipse, when i want to scroll down past the last line, i need to make more blank lines
Dec 13 21:46:11 <rustPushmaster>	by pressing enter multiple times which is really annoying
Dec 14 01:37:03 <strykerawb>	is repo.eclipse.org down ?
Dec 14 01:37:16 <jvava>	I am learning PDE to make a plugin, I dont know how to run a plugin so every time I make a change to source I have to export and install them to watch effect, please help
Dec 14 01:37:41 <strykerawb>	right-click on your plugin project, select run as -> eclipse application
Dec 14 01:37:53 <strykerawb>	jvava,
Dec 14 01:38:51 <jvava>	strykerawb, I will try, thank you
Dec 14 01:39:45 <jvava>	It open a new eclipse splash, that's not what I expect
Dec 14 01:39:59 <strykerawb>	it opens a new eclipse runtime workbench
Dec 14 01:40:03 <strykerawb>	with your plugin installed in it
Dec 14 01:40:14 <jvava>	Can I avoid it?
Dec 14 01:40:17 <strykerawb>	.............
Dec 14 01:40:21 <strykerawb>	how else do you expect to test it?
Dec 14 01:40:42 <strykerawb>	you're trying to avoid installing it in your eclipse, right?
Dec 14 01:40:53 <strykerawb>	the way to avoid installing is to have a new temporary workbench open
Dec 14 01:41:21 <jvava>	hmm, I have another project using this plugin, I hope runing this project which know the plugin changed and reload it
Dec 14 01:42:15 <strykerawb>	that project should probably be imported into your runtime workbench.  Generally the projects (i assuem a normal project, not a plugin project) that use your plugin should not exist in your plugin development environment
Dec 14 01:42:25 <strykerawb>	they should only exist in your temporary eclipse workspace
Dec 14 01:42:40 <strykerawb>	the "temporary eclipse workspace" doesn't delete its contents each time
Dec 14 01:42:45 <strykerawb>	unless you ask it to
Dec 14 01:43:18 <strykerawb>	basically, you generally use your normal eclipse to develop the plugin, and the temporary runtime-workbench to use it and create projects that use your plugin
Dec 14 01:43:53 <jvava>	say, the plugin e4b provide a bazel build support, I install e4b first and create a new project name teste4b with the e4b plugin, then I download e4b plugin and import into workspace, then I change some thing
Dec 14 01:45:02 <jvava>	now I hope the change take effect at once, is it feasible?
Dec 14 01:45:35 <strykerawb>	teste4b should not exist in your plugin development workspace. It should only be in your runtime-workbench temporary eclipse
Dec 14 01:45:57 <strykerawb>	once your e4b plugin is perfect and ready for release, then you should release it and let others install it directly
Dec 14 01:46:16 <strykerawb>	but when developing e4b,  then teste4b should not exist in your normal workspace, bc it is only for testing your plugin
Dec 14 01:47:03 <jvava>	so I must have two eclipse running at last, one for plugin, and one for test plugin?
Dec 14 01:47:32 <strykerawb>	yes, until your plugin is perfect and ready for release.
Dec 14 01:47:41 <strykerawb>	this is actually better bc you can change code on-the-fly
Dec 14 01:47:50 <strykerawb>	you can do hotcode replace
Dec 14 01:48:01 <strykerawb>	you can develop while you test (so long as you don't add new methods)
Dec 14 01:48:13 <strykerawb>	you can trace through the plugin code to see where or how it is not working properly
Dec 14 01:48:26 <strykerawb>	these are things you cannot do if you install it directly
Dec 14 01:49:20 <jvava>	ok, to change code on-the-fly, need I start runtime-workbench in debug mode?
Dec 14 01:49:26 <strykerawb>	yep :D
Dec 14 01:49:31 <strykerawb>	also can use breakpoints :D
Dec 14 01:49:36 <jvava>	now I see, thank you
Dec 14 01:49:42 <strykerawb>	very useful ;)
Dec 14 01:49:51 <strykerawb>	good luck with your project! :D
Dec 14 01:50:14 <jvava>	always can got good answer here, great man!
Dec 14 07:28:47 <ak77>	hello.
Dec 14 07:29:59 <ak77>	anyone knows how could I make when hovering enum (C/C++) in editor to show hexdecimal value? currently it shows decimal value (this is not a debugging, but editor question)

This isnt a huge problem except as it comes to placing things like input fields, database connections and the like which are p

Dec 18 11:19:32 <metrixx>	what is the shortcut to open suggessions window when a line has warning?
Dec 18 11:19:59 <metrixx>	i don't know the window name exactly but it offers to import or supress something
Dec 18 11:26:34 <metrixx>	hey
Dec 18 11:26:55 <metrixx>	adante, don't sleep
Dec 18 11:34:38 <davidmichaelkarr>	metrixx: i believe you're talking about the quick fix, might be ctrl+1 . You can always see these bindings in prefs.
Dec 18 11:36:13 <metrixx>	davidmichaelkarr, i didn't know the window name exactly. thank you, it seems like ctrl + 1 but i couldn't use because of remote desktop right now.
Dec 18 12:18:28 <grumble>	i'm trying to test Oxygen M4 with the BETA_JAVA9 builds of the JDT and I think I'm doing something wrong (cannot add JRE 9 as an execution environment). Adding it as a "Standard VM" doesn't work properly, it has no attached libraries. I think that's because eclipse doesn't recognize the modules. Can someone point me in the right direction?

Dec 19 03:22:35 <mvvvv>	sewerrat, what is the nature of thes repositories ?
Dec 19 03:23:17 <davidmichaelkarr>	sewerrat: need much more info. Don't even know what language you're using.
Dec 19 03:23:58 <sewerrat>	Sorry about that, java and im trying to add JSch, but i dont understand how to.
Dec 19 03:26:14 <davidmichaelkarr>	sewerrat: are you using maven?
Dec 19 03:26:37 <sewerrat>	let me check.
Dec 19 03:27:14 <davidmichaelkarr>	sewerrat: lol. That'll be a no.
Dec 19 03:27:47 <sewerrat>	Just installed it on ubuntu and used their repositories so not sure what version i got.
Dec 19 03:28:20 <sewerrat>	Dont think its maven, just says eclipse 3.8.
Dec 19 03:28:23 <davidmichaelkarr>	sewerrat: if you're not using maven or gradle, you'll have to download the jar file from the internet and store it in your project.
Dec 19 03:28:42 <sewerrat>	Ok, and where in my project do i store it?
Dec 19 03:38:36 <davidmichaelkarr>	sewerrat: doesn't matter a lot. Make a "lib" dir and put it there.
Dec 19 03:38:50 <sewerrat>	Thanks, will give it a try.
Dec 19 03:42:01 <sewerrat>	Figured it out, forgot to add it to the build path, thank you for your kind help, have a nice day!

Dec 19 05:23:15 <Cyp___>	Eclipse crashes whenever the mouse hovers over anything. There seems to be something to do with XUL in the log. I think no distros have xulrunner anymore. Is it still possible to run Eclipse on Linux?
Dec 19 05:24:35 <Cyp___>	It also crashes if going to Window → Preferences → General → Web Browser.
Dec 19 05:26:02 <Cyp___>	If I understand right, it might be possible to stop it from trying to use xulrunner there, so if I could open the menu without it crashing and change a setting, it might then be possible to open the menu without it crashing and change the setting.
Dec 19 05:38:26 <mvvvv>	Cyp___, it's a old problem which eclipse verison are you using ?
Dec 19 05:44:24 <Cyp___>	mvvvv: 4.4.
Dec 19 05:44:38 <mvvvv>	and the OS ?
Dec 19 05:44:52 <Cyp___>	Gentoo Linux.
Dec 19 05:47:26 <mvvvv>	Add the following lines at the end of your eclipse.ini:
Dec 19 05:47:34 <mvvvv>	-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.DefaultType=webkit
Dec 19 05:47:43 <mvvvv>	-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.UseWebKitGTK=true
Dec 19 05:48:37 <Cyp___>	I don't think I have an eclipse.ini.
Dec 19 05:49:03 <mvvvv>	in your eclipse installtion directory
Dec 19 05:49:35 <Cyp___>	Unless you mean ~/android-sdks/tools/lib/monitor-x86/eclipse.ini
Dec 19 05:50:03 <mvvvv>	Cyp___, where did you installed eclipse ?
Dec 19 05:51:07 <Cyp___>	Oh, there's an /opt/eclipse-bin-sdk-4.4/eclipse.ini.
Dec 19 05:51:18 <Cyp___>	s/bin-sdk/sdk-bin/
Dec 19 05:51:44 <mvvvv>	Cyp___, check with the path of your launcher. I have to go
Dec 19 05:57:21 <Cyp___>	Adding it didn't help.
Dec 19 08:43:51 <Cyp___>	Updating to eclipse-bin-4.6 seems to have helped, now everything just flickers a lot when hovering over anything, which is better than crashing.
Dec 19 08:51:06 <mvvvv>	Cyp___, do you know what is your gtk 3 version ?
Dec 19 08:53:33 <Cyp___>	Not sure, I have x11-libs/gtk+-3.20.9, which might be it.
Dec 19 08:54:41 <mvvvv>	Cyp___, in a terminal try : export SWT_GTK3=0
Dec 19 08:54:45 <mvvvv>	then launch eclipse
Dec 19 08:54:50 <mvvvv>	from the terminal
Dec 19 08:58:35 <Cyp___>	After doing that, it crashes before it even creates a window.
Dec 19 09:03:58 <mvvvv>	Cyp___, are you using webkit or xulrunner ?
Dec 19 09:08:29 <Cyp___>	I have webkit installed, don't know if I'm using it. I don't seem to have xulrunner anywhere, don't think my distro even has it.
Dec 19 09:08:59 <Cyp___>	After restarting it again, the flickering seems to be gone, don't know why.
Dec 19 09:10:01 <Cyp___>	Now I'm getting popups saying things like "String cannot be resolved to a type".
Dec 19 09:15:15 <mvvvv>	Cyp___, you should have the detail in the "Problems view"

Dec 19 15:29:22 <ta160>	good afternoon - im looking for a wyswig plugin for editing PHP and HTML files for eclipse, there is one mentioned in the docs, but I forgot to bring the name with me (im remote today) -- can someone please point me to it?
Dec 19 17:04:28 <nitind>	Which docs?
Dec 19 18:01:52 <mebigfatguy>	hi folks, was wondering how eclipse decides what 'line' a breakpoint was put on. I was hoping it would naively take whatever line you set the break point on, but that appears not to be the case.
Dec 19 18:02:25 <mebigfatguy>	It appears that it tries to actually parse the source file, rather than just look up the byte code offset based on the linenumbertable attribute of the class.
Dec 19 18:03:15 <mebigfatguy>	in my case, my 'source' isn't java. and certainly not something eclipse understands
Dec 19 18:30:09 <davidmichaelkarr>	mebigfatguy: in my experience, it corresponds to the class file line records, not the source file.
Dec 19 18:51:51 <mebigfatguy>	thats whag j had hoped
Dec 19 18:52:19 <mebigfatguy>	apparently not
Dec 19 23:33:12 <nitind>	mebigfatguy: It depends on the editor and language you're working with. Some lines don't contain a statement that you can break on, and the editor will still try to create one on the next valid line. But like I said, depends on the editor and language.
Dec 19 23:33:31 <nitind>	If it's not something Eclipse understands, I'm not sure how the question even comes up, though.
Dec 20 01:02:47 <mebigfatguy>	i was hoping that eclipse would just go by the class name, and line number to find the byte code offset. apparently it doesn't
Dec 20 01:02:57 <mebigfatguy>	it certainly could
Dec 20 01:03:37 <mebigfatguy>	naively i would expect it to take the line number you clicked on, find the nearest entry in the line number table, use that, and adjust the line number it graphically sets the break point on based on that.
Dec 20 01:06:33 <mebigfatguy>	here is the project in question: https://github.com/mebigfatguy/baremetal4j
Dec 20 01:33:01 -e-	[global notice] Good morning! Please read the following announcement from freenode's infrastructure team: https://freenode.net/news/PSA-brief-update-infra
Dec 20 09:02:32 <jero->	hi, when using neon.1 on fedora 25 (both w/ openjdk and oracle jre 1.8), gtk3 dialog windows are truncated on the right, making widgets unseeable/unusable
Dec 20 09:02:50 <jero->	I can get them right forcing gtk2, is that expected?
Dec 20 09:09:15 <mvvvv>	jero- almost every new version of gtk3 is a mess for eclipse. I 've seen a problem due to webkit2. can you try : export SWT_WEBKIT2=1
Dec 20 09:09:43 <jero->	mvvvv: I was able to get the dialogs right by forcing SWT_GTK3=0
Dec 20 09:09:53 <jero->	mvvvv: but it's good to know :)
Dec 20 09:10:16 <mvvvv>	open a new term and try : export SWT_WEBKIT2=1
Dec 20 09:12:44 <jero->	mvvvv: so I unset SWT_GTK3, and set SWT_WEBKIT2=1 but the widgets are broken again. looks like my issue is related to the 1st
Dec 20 09:14:18 <jero->	mvvvv: setting both SWT_WEBKIT2=1 and SWT_GTK3=0 makes it even unhappier :| cf. http://imgur.com/a/SNzYF
Dec 20 09:15:28 <jero->	mvvvv: I'll stick with SWT_GTK3=0 :)
Dec 20 09:16:56 <mvvvv>	jero-, did you installed eclipse from the Fedora packages ? of from eclipse download site ?
Dec 20 09:17:15 <jero->	mvvvv: it's cdt from the download site
Dec 20 09:20:40 <mvvvv>	jero-, https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Eclipse
Dec 20 09:57:34 <jero->	mvvvv: thanks for your help :)
Dec 20 14:52:41 <dysoco>	Hello. What is the proper way to develop using Eclipse PHP on Windows, but where everything (PHP, Database, project, etc.) is on a Vagrant VM?
Dec 20 14:52:52 <dysoco>	Apparently I can remote debug with zend/xdebug but what about the PHP executable?
Dec 20 14:54:27 <dysoco>	Or do I install PHP on my host Windows machine with the same PHP version than the VM and use that?

Dec 20 16:57:26 <ipun>	Hi, does anyone know where the Rearranging Views logic is inside Eclipse? http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2FgettingStarted%2Fqs-39d.htm
Dec 20 22:52:20 <prob12>	When extracting for example 'eclipse.tar.gz', I get folder 'eclipse-installer', after installing, does that folder change it's name to 'eclipse', or will it remain the same?
Dec 20 22:56:42 <davidmichaelkarr>	prob12: the installer executable is in that folder.
Dec 20 23:01:48 <prob12>	davidmichaelkarr: Im following http://askubuntu.com/questions/26632/how-to-install-eclipse -guide on instaling eclipse on my Ubuntu, and it says for example:
Dec 20 23:02:11 <prob12>	"Create a symlink in /usr/local/bin using  sudo ln -s /opt/eclipse/eclipse /usr/local/bin/eclipse44"
Dec 20 23:02:39 <prob12>	"/opt/eclipse/eclipse" should I use "/opt/eclipse-installer/eclipse" instead?
Dec 20 23:03:31 <nitind>	Why are you bothering with /opt? Is more than one user going to be using it?
Dec 20 23:04:57 <prob12>	nitind, not really. Im just quite new with Ubuntu and stuff. Just following that guide
Dec 20 23:06:14 <davidmichaelkarr>	prob12: ignore that, obsolete. Just follow the instructions in the eclipse Installer.
Dec 20 23:11:20 <prob12>	I'll see where I get myself doing so, gotta sleep now though. Thanks for your help

Dec 21 13:42:44 <StephenLynx>	hey, eclipse is complaining that gnu::unused is wrong.
Dec 21 13:42:51 <StephenLynx>	is it possible to make it accept it?
Dec 21 13:43:57 <StephenLynx>	it says its invalid syntax.

Dec 22 02:45:39 <AndrewPRS>	eclipse doesn't let me open all of them at the same time
Dec 22 02:45:43 <AndrewPRS>	anyone know why this could be?

Jan 03 11:02:39 <PereP>	hi all
Jan 03 11:02:48 <PereP>	anyone with experience integrating the BIRT runtime?
Jan 03 11:03:18 <PereP>	I downloaded it from here: http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/
Jan 03 11:03:53 <PereP>	followed instructions, tried doing a Platform.startup() but all I get is null
Jan 03 11:05:04 <PereP>	what does "setting a parent classloader for engine" mean?
Jan 03 11:20:43 <PereP>	any recommendations
Jan 03 11:20:44 <PereP>	?
Jan 03 11:41:52 <AndrewNPKT>	no idea, sorry
Jan 03 11:41:53 <AndrewNPKT>	:P
Jan 03 16:10:10 <jrtappers>	Is there something odd with using ITextContentDescriber?
Jan 03 16:11:20 <jrtappers>	I have a class registered with "org.eclipse.core.contenttype.contentTypes" with a describer, but it seems to be neither constructed not used
Jan 03 16:15:58 <nitind>	when?
Jan 03 16:21:55 <jrtappers>	Neon
Jan 03 16:22:56 <jrtappers>	When should I expect the describer be constructed?
Jan 03 16:26:01 <nitind>	I kind of thought you knew that, and then were asking why it wasn't being called at those times.
Jan 03 16:26:28 <jrtappers>	I thought it would be early on, but it seems to never be called, as if I have missed a step
Jan 03 16:26:55 <nitind>	What's the relevant part of your plugin.xml look like? ~paste
Jan 03 16:26:55 <Arbalest>	Please paste the relevant information onto a pastebin. The submission will then generate a URL, please copy/paste the generated URL back to the channel - http://pastebin.com - http://pastebin.ca - http://gist.github.com
Jan 03 16:27:03 <jrtappers>	Hence the warnings in the docs about premature activation
Jan 03 16:29:10 <nitind>	Not sure if that was an answer for anything asked. It should trigger when opening the file's Properties dialog, to detect the encoding.
Jan 03 16:29:37 <jrtappers>	https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5bade12040e4b7ed8171e34b4fa4afbc
Jan 03 16:29:47 <jrtappers>	The one above works, so I trimmed it out
Jan 03 16:32:00 <nitind>	I don't know what that's supposed to tell me.
Jan 03 16:33:05 <nitind>	Try setting a breakpoint in org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.dialogs.ResourceInfoPage.getContentDescription(IResource) and open the properties dialog on one of your files.
Jan 03 16:44:13 <jrtappers>	It triggers, what should I be looking for?
Jan 03 16:46:58 <jrtappers>	It calls ContentDescriptionManager.getDescriptionFor, which returns null on line 337
Jan 03 16:56:35 <nitind>	Keep stepping further in.
Jan 03 16:58:19 <nitind>	Try it with a new file
Jan 03 17:00:53 <jrtappers>	nitind, same
Jan 03 17:01:33 <nitind>	So, again, what's the relevant part of your plugin.xml look like?
Jan 03 17:01:39 <jrtappers>	The comment on the line above the return is this:   // presumably, this file has no known content type
Jan 03 17:01:53 <jrtappers>	https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5bade12040e4b7ed8171e34b4fa4afbc
Jan 03 17:02:59 <jrtappers>	<<describer>> is the class name
Jan 03 17:05:22 <nitind>	You have no filename extensions or base content type. When should it know when to ask your describer?
Jan 03 17:08:27 <jrtappers>	nitrid, I'm trying to match all files, so have all files delegate to the describer to check if they should match or not
Jan 03 17:08:43 <nitind>	That's not how it works. It wouldn't scale.
Jan 03 17:08:59 <nitind>	What's the problem this is supposed to solve?
Jan 03 17:10:36 <jrtappers>	Parsing generated languages, I can get it to work when the strings have the extension str, but they can have any extension, so I need this to match any files that are not grammars or config files
Jan 03 17:11:29 <nitind>	Trying to get to the root of it, to solve what problem?
Jan 03 17:13:23 <jrtappers>	You have a project with these files in {a.grm, b.xxx}, a defines the language, b is a program written in that language
Jan 03 17:15:47 <jrtappers>	But xxx could be anything
Jan 03 17:19:03 <nitind>	This is a variant of the 5 Whys, but what's the actual problem you're trying to solve? How would the describer itself tell them apart?
Jan 03 17:22:07 <jrtappers>	nitind, Any file in a project with the nature that is not defining a language or a config file would be assumed to be a string file
Jan 03 17:23:19 <nitind>	Why is that important, and how would the describer tell them apart based on the simple filename and contents?
Jan 03 17:24:55 <jrtappers>	nitind, Is there a better way to match files to an editor when the extension is unknown until runtime?
Jan 03 17:27:35 <jrtappers>	When the user creates a grammar I could prompt them for the extension
Jan 03 17:28:12 <nitind>	Not that I know of, not before the fact. This is an editor for the grammar or for the sources that the grammar's generated output would handle? After the fact, you could *possibly* try org.eclipse.core.runtime.content.IContentTypeSettings.addFileSpec(String, int) .
Jan 04 04:07:05 <ImQ009>	Hello. How do you change the font size of the editor? I tried General -> Appearance -> Colors and Fonts but it appears those settings have no effect
Jan 04 04:11:55 <ImQ009>	Figured it out. Forgot I had GTK3 enabled
Jan 04 04:20:55 <Gamoder_>	Hi everyone, is there a tool for eclipse available which checks if there is a possiblility to assign a compiling Generics type assignment and if possible, proposes that?
Jan 04 04:21:31 <Gamoder_>	I often have the problem that I need to fix generics and the error message is rather long so it takes some time to find out what the offending type is and to fix it
Jan 04 05:15:09 <AndrewNPKT>	hey there everyone! a quick question... is it possible for eclipse to fill the parameters of a member in C++? Supposedly there's an option for it in the context assist but it doesn't seem to work... I see the popup but it won't complete

Jan 04 05:26:20 <pitastrudl>	should i install eclipse in the home or the /opt directory?
Jan 04 05:26:52 <AndrewNPKT>	whatever you like better
Jan 04 05:27:21 <AndrewNPKT>	I think it is more portable if you install in the /opt directory
Jan 04 05:27:42 <AndrewNPKT>	for example if you have that directory in other partition, or other users share it with you

Jan 06 10:08:15 <paissad>	davidmichaelkarr: i checked the proxy settings, and it's using "Native" as active provider ... and i can see that the settings are as the same as the ones for the system itself
Jan 06 10:29:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	paissad: ok. Dunno about archetypes. Never use them.

Jan 06 11:20:04 <asti>	it tells me:
Jan 06 11:20:32 <asti>	cannot execute binary file: Exec format not supported
Jan 06 11:21:16 <asti>	how do I use the JDK8 with eclipse/
Jan 06 11:21:17 <asti>	?
Jan 06 11:27:13 <mvvvv>	asti, how did you installed JDK ?
Jan 06 11:28:50 <asti>	mvvvv: by going to the oracle web site and downloading the i586 architecture
Jan 06 11:29:00 <asti>	I couldn't install any other architecture for some reason
Jan 06 11:29:06 <asti>	and I have the i7 CPI
Jan 06 11:29:07 <asti>	CPU

Jan 06 11:30:37 <mvvvv>	ho sorry debian
Jan 06 11:32:21 <mvvvv>	not the good tar.gz I think. You don't want to use OpenJDK from Debian ?
Jan 06 11:32:46 <nitind>	which binary is that message referring to?
Jan 06 11:34:51 <mvvvv>	I don't use debian so maybe this can help : https://wiki.debian.org/Java
Jan 06 11:35:02 <asti>	I want to use java8
Jan 06 11:35:42 <mvvvv>	openjdk-8-jdk or sun JDK 8 ?
Jan 06 11:44:28 <asti>	mvvvv: openjdk-8
Jan 06 11:45:09 <mvvvv>	So you should install the deb https://wiki.debian.org/Java

Jan 17 07:39:51 <lolek>	hello everybody
Jan 17 07:40:01 <lolek>	I've got a situation with eclipse formatter
Jan 17 07:40:27 <lolek>	I'm trying to change the way the "public", "protected", "private" are indented but so far I came to nowhere
Jan 17 07:40:34 <lolek>	I should mention I'm doing this for c++
Jan 17 07:54:03 <lolek>	hmm seems that there's no option to configure this from the ui, it was possible from the xml file
Jan 17 08:06:23 <AndrewNPKT>	lolek it is
Jan 17 08:06:26 <AndrewNPKT>	*there is
Jan 17 08:06:34 <lolek>	AndrewNPKT: where?
Jan 17 08:08:00 <AndrewNPKT>	window -> preferences -> c++ -> code style -> formatter -> edit your profile -> indentation
Jan 17 08:08:27 <AndrewNPKT>	there is a checkbox which lets you decide if public private and protected are indented
Jan 17 08:08:56 <lolek>	that doesn't give me what I want
Jan 17 08:09:00 <AndrewNPKT>	oh ok
Jan 17 08:09:03 <AndrewNPKT>	then I don't know :P
Jan 17 08:09:04 <lolek>	yeah :)
Jan 17 08:09:06 <lolek>	hehe
Jan 17 08:09:14 <AndrewNPKT>	maybe you can customize it further
Jan 17 08:09:19 <lolek>	no prob I was able to handle it manually changing xml file
Jan 17 08:09:20 <AndrewNPKT>	but I don't know how
Jan 17 08:09:22 <AndrewNPKT>	what do you need?
Jan 17 08:09:25 <AndrewNPKT>	oh ok
Jan 17 08:09:33 <AndrewNPKT>	god bless xml
Jan 17 08:09:34 <lolek>	let me give you the var name
Jan 17 08:09:34 <AndrewNPKT>	^_^
Jan 17 08:09:44 <AndrewNPKT>	why do you need custom indentation for those?
Jan 17 08:09:47 <lolek>	org.eclipse.cdt.core.formatter.indent_access_specifier_extra_spaces"
Jan 17 08:09:48 <AndrewNPKT>	just curious
Jan 17 08:09:48 <lolek>	here
Jan 17 08:10:02 <lolek>	somehow I had 1 there... I did change it to 0
Jan 17 08:10:13 <lolek>	well I'm changing google style code a little bit
Jan 17 08:10:26 <lolek>	but if we're here
Jan 17 08:10:36 <lolek>	there's one more thing I'm unable to change, even from xml
Jan 17 08:10:43 <lolek>	the initializer list
Jan 17 08:11:03 <lolek>	so there's that Point(double x, double y): <new line> : x(x), y(y) {
Jan 17 08:11:10 <lolek>	the question is, how to disable that new line
Jan 17 08:11:24 <lolek>	I've checked all options I thouhgt can be related to that without any success
Jan 17 08:11:29 <lolek>	that <new line> is always there :/
Jan 17 08:11:48 <AndrewNPKT>	hmmm
Jan 17 08:12:37 <lolek>	try the K&R profile if you have cdt and try to change it... from what I see it's impossible but I hope I'm wrong
Jan 17 08:14:30 <AndrewNPKT>	can't find it :/
Jan 17 08:16:06 <AndrewNPKT>	sorry :/
Jan 17 08:43:17 <lolek>	AndrewNPKT: nah, no prob
Jan 17 16:35:45 <altendky>	my coworkers and i use ccstudio from texas instruments on windows and noticed when we updated (underlying eclipse was 4.5.1, now 4.6.0) that our c project path/to/script.py pre-build steps now attempt to interpret the shebang line rather than just letting windows follow the association between .py files and py.exe (which handled the linux-compatible shebang
Jan 17 16:35:45 <altendky>	just fine).  i've searched but have been unable to find any references for this change.  is anyone here familiar with it?
Jan 17 17:59:56 <codeperson>	Hello. Does anyone know how I could get the Eclipse client's tab-size?
Jan 17 18:00:14 <codeperson>	By default, tab-size is set to 4 but users are able to change this.
Jan 18 00:52:59 <mac->	in Eclipse I can do Close Project, then it will be unloaded from the environemnt but it lasts on the tree
Jan 18 00:53:02 <mac->	can I do sth to remove it from the tree ?
Jan 18 00:53:05 <mac->	in a way that I will be able to open it again on demand
Jan 18 00:57:55 <nitind>	What do yo mean by, "tree?"
Jan 18 01:09:17 <mac->	I mean 'Package Explorer'
Jan 18 01:09:41 <mac->	nitind: this time I have answered you :p
Jan 18 01:23:46 <nitind>	mac-: Check the view's local menu for Filters.
Jan 18 01:26:19 <mac->	let me take a look
Jan 18 01:28:34 <mac->	ok, I can enable filter to not to show closed projects
Jan 18 01:28:46 <mac->	its similar to functionality I asked about
Jan 18 01:30:19 <mac->	hm and it shown in the View Menu that I can toggle it quickly
Jan 18 01:30:43 <mac->	what is the condition to show such elements in View Menu ?
Jan 18 01:32:20 <nitind>	The authors had the forethought to put it there.
Jan 18 02:09:05 <mac->	uhm
Jan 18 02:09:17 <mac->	nitind: thx
Jan 18 02:12:23 <nitind>	Then I'm not sure what you're asking.
Jan 18 02:12:36 <nitind>	There's precedent for that.
Jan 18 02:14:09 <mac->	I used Netbeans for short time and there it was possible to load and unload completely projects when in Eclipse now I see that I can do 'Close' on project but it remains in Package Explorer (but closed)
Jan 18 02:16:36 <nitind>	yes, and...?
Jan 18 02:33:00 <mac->	hm, when you have plenty of projects you usually don't want to have them all in Package Explorer
Jan 18 02:45:59 <nitind>	So it's not about hiding closed ones so much as grouping them arbitrarily and showing the group(s) you care about?
Jan 18 03:04:23 <mac->	yeah it is closer to my idea
Jan 18 03:07:21 <nitind>	Try out working sets: http://help.eclipse.org/neon/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cworkset.htm?cp=0_2_1_6
Jan 18 03:07:36 <mac->	yeah, I thought about worksets
Jan 18 03:09:04 <nitind>	Your SCM may also permit something like this. With git, you don't want the projects to physically be in the workspace directly, so you can delete them from the workspace without removing them from the actual working directory (just watch the dialog prompts). You can then re-import them later using the Git Repositories View.
Jan 18 04:08:09 <Prob>	HOLY SHIT guys, what is so hard about adding an "open in explorer'" button? How many years does Eclipse exist now, 30 years?
Jan 18 04:36:19 <mac->	nitind: ok, I think I understood Working Sets
Jan 18 04:37:04 <mac->	but not sure about Action Sets :>
Jan 18 06:18:15 <Tobbi>	Anyone knowledgeable about the RCP Testing Tool?
Jan 18 06:23:18 <Tobbi>	I am getting the error "Couldn't open ECL session.
Jan 18 08:05:08 <barq>	I get an unhandled event loop excpetion in Eclipse neon. I already tried deleting workbench.xmi but still get the error after every start. How can i get Eclipse to work again?
Jan 18 08:08:15 <mbooth>	barq: What platform?
Jan 18 08:08:34 <barq>	fedora 25
Jan 18 08:09:11 <mbooth>	barq: Please try latest updates from updates-testing repository: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-ddde4436aa
Jan 18 08:09:32 <barq>	?
Jan 18 08:10:01 <mbooth>	barq: Are you using the Eclipse that ships with Fedora?
Jan 18 08:10:02 <barq>	It's a fedora specific bug?
Jan 18 08:10:05 <barq>	no
Jan 18 08:10:37 <barq>	I don't think my fedora shipped with any eclipse, but not using it for sure.
Jan 18 08:10:56 <mbooth>	Ah okay. We were seeing "workbench.xmi" related problems in the Fedora packages, which should be fixed with latest updates.
Jan 18 08:11:43 <mbooth>	barq: If you are not using the Fedora versions, then of course it doesn't apply :-)
Jan 18 08:20:06 <barq>	mbooth: There are a few bugs on the topic: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497705
Jan 18 08:20:38 <barq>	But if I run with GTK2 I don't get the crash but then I have overlays with text matching background color so I can't debug properly
Jan 18 08:22:15 <mbooth>	barq: Then I encourage you to try the Fedora packages -- we carry various fixes that did not make it into an upstream release yet
Jan 18 08:23:59 <barq>	so just enablerepo updates testing?
Jan 18 08:24:17 <barq>	Are you referring to the same eclipse package?
Jan 18 08:25:00 <mbooth>	barq: If you don't already have it installed, you can get it from the gnome software center, or from command line:
Jan 18 08:25:03 <mbooth>	sudo dnf --enablerepo=updates-testing install eclipse
Jan 18 08:25:17 <barq>	Oh you're talking about Eclipse upstream?
Jan 18 08:25:20 <barq>	Or linux?
Jan 18 08:25:38 <mbooth>	I talk about the Fedora packaged version of Eclipse
Jan 18 08:28:03 <barq>	I need adt, though
Jan 18 08:29:35 <mbooth>	Hmm, we don't yet carry adt as a package in Fedora, but "Help->Install new software" works for installing plugins that are not yet in Fedora.
Jan 18 08:29:57 <mbooth>	Although (full disclaimer) I don't use adt, so I haven't tried installing it
Jan 18 08:32:59 <barq>	I have trouble getting updates in Eclipse because of the proxy settings.
Jan 18 08:34:17 <Tobbi>	How do I find the plugin directory of an eclipse installation again?
Jan 18 16:48:08 <codeperson>	Hello. I am trying to create a table in a view using a third party plugin, however I am getting the following error:
Jan 18 16:48:10 <codeperson>	org.eclipse.e4.core.di.InjectionException: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: de/ralfebert/rcputils/tables/TableViewerBuilder
Jan 18 16:48:22 <codeperson>	Could anyone help me with this?
Jan 18 16:49:43 <codeperson>	The code editor has detected the class, so it definitely exists. My code seems to be correct too. I'm thinking that there must be a configuration error in Eclipse somewhere, but I'm not sure where.
Jan 18 17:05:23 <codeperson>	Hmm. :c
Jan 18 17:37:18 <codeperson>	Never mind, fixed it.
Jan 18 17:47:33 <nitind>	How?
Jan 18 17:48:11 <codeperson>	I learned how to use the p2 installer
Jan 18 17:48:27 <codeperson>	It turns out that it is designed to be installed as a p2 plugin, not a library.
Jan 18 17:48:35 <codeperson>	Silly me. I learn from my mistakes.
Jan 18 21:42:01 <applepi>	Hi all :)  I'm newish to eclipse, looking for a bit of advice for the best way to handle something..  I'm making a project where I'm doing a lot of work with students and would like the classpath and libraries to not have to be added every time I check my project out from SVN
Jan 18 21:42:44 <applepi>	So I'd like the JARs to be added under the relative path of ./lib, and the classpath to include this..  is this doable?
Jan 19 01:36:37 <Anonaly>	Hi, I am trying to use eclipse on Ubuntu to develop Apache Cordova projects,
Jan 19 01:37:02 <Anonaly>	I have configured the project so there are no errors in the code (according to Eclipse)
Jan 19 01:37:54 <Anonaly>	where can I find the settings for Cordova so that it properly opens the emulator, because right now it is not working when I use the "run as android emulator" function.
Jan 19 01:39:08 <Anonaly>	the error "<terminated> /home/xxxxx/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb
Jan 19 01:40:12 <Anonaly>	keeps trying to run over and over, I have to kill Eclipse to get it to stop trying to run
Jan 19 03:43:37 <Anonaly>	so  have tried quite a few things to get Eclipse to be able to run my Cordova app.  I can emulate the app in the command line by running  "cordova run android" .  This works 10)%.
Jan 19 03:43:42 <Anonaly>	(100%)
Jan 19 03:44:35 <Anonaly>	eclipse gets stuck at 2% and keeps flashing an message in the output box ( <terminated> /home/xxxxx/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb )
Jan 19 03:45:44 <Anonaly>	I have to kill eclipse to stop this message from flashing at the bottom
Jan 19 03:46:06 <Anonaly>	I guess there is no way to stop the emulator from trying to start, once you hit "Run as Android App" from the Run menu
Jan 19 03:46:25 <Anonaly>	it just keeps trying over and over, endlessly. The stop button does absolutely nothing.
Jan 19 03:47:06 <Anonaly>	my app is a brand new cordova app, and eclipse imports it with no problems. No syntax errors in the code.
Jan 19 03:47:22 <Anonaly>	Thanks for the help
Jan 19 03:47:35 <Anonaly>	I will wait for a response
Jan 19 07:39:55 <Rudhva>	Hi, I would like to know if eclipse is applying for GSOC'2017

Jan 23 12:24:57 <josteele>	Does anyone know of a way to render Markdown using SWT? I'm sure I could do it using a browser, but I have many Markdown messages I'd like to display within a Composite, and I'm not sure about embedding multiple browsers.
Jan 23 13:07:13 <codeperson>	Does anyone know how I would get the Reflections class working in my plugin? It's in the build path, the editor is recognising it and the plugin is running, but when I try to run the function it I'm getting "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/reflections/Reflections".
Jan 23 13:14:13 <josteele>	codeperson: so it's there at compile time, but not at runtime when your running the plugin?
Jan 23 13:14:25 <codeperson>	That is correct
Jan 23 13:15:35 <josteele>	codeperson: does this dependency live in some folder within the plugin (like a lib folder or something)?
Jan 23 13:15:48 <codeperson>	I did create a 'lib' folder for it.
Jan 23 13:17:14 <josteele>	codeperson: ensure there's a classpathentry within the .classpath file of that plugin
Jan 23 13:18:04 <codeperson>		<classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/reflections-0.9.10.jar"/>
Jan 23 13:18:06 <codeperson>	It's there
Jan 23 13:19:31 <josteele>	codeperson: also ensure there's a entry within the build.properties bin.includes = lib/dependency.jar
Jan 23 13:21:34 <josteele>	codeperson: you should see the dependency here in the classpath section: http://imgur.com/a/zYiGE
Jan 23 13:22:46 <codeperson>	Huh. Adding the jar to that classpath section changed the missing class error.
Jan 23 13:22:52 <codeperson>	java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/common/base/Predicate
Jan 23 13:23:12 <josteele>	okay, that's one step in the right direction
Jan 23 13:23:22 <codeperson>	Excellent
Jan 23 13:23:32 <codeperson>	It doesn't seem to be mentioned in the build.properties.
Jan 23 13:23:42 <josteele>	that's optional
Jan 23 13:23:52 <codeperson>	Ah, alright.
Jan 23 13:23:59 <josteele>	more important when building
Jan 23 13:26:12 <josteele>	you should be able to add a standard 'Required Plug-ins' dependency for the guava stuff
Jan 23 13:26:56 <codeperson>	I'm not using the Guava jar. I'm assuming that Guava is part of Reflections? I'm not sure.
Jan 23 13:27:07 <codeperson>	But I haven't added Guava to this project.
Jan 23 13:27:25 <codeperson>	I guess I'll see about adding it anyway
Jan 23 13:32:11 <codeperson>	Next one up: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javassist/bytecode/ClassFile
Jan 23 13:35:26 <josteele>	codeperson: this is pretty standard stuff when dealing with a Maven project - https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections/blob/master/pom.xml#L71
Jan 23 13:36:51 <josteele>	codeperson: these are the dependencies of this Reflections project. You might want to just do an install, and then all all the installed jars to your path
Jan 23 13:37:24 <codeperson>	Mmm, yeah. I'll give it a go. Thanks.
Jan 23 13:49:03 <codeperson>	Thank you, josteele!
Jan 23 14:02:02 <defanco>	Where in Git repo is source code for 'New Static Web Project'?
Jan 23 14:03:28 <defanco>	Also, has anybody extended WTP before?
Jan 23 14:16:09 <josteele>	defanco: it probably isn't a git repo
Jan 23 14:17:33 <josteele>	defanco: oh, i guess it is http://git.eclipse.org/c/?q=webtools
Jan 23 14:19:30 <defanco>	josteele, I found that. But can't find which plugin has the web projects wizards
Jan 23 14:23:37 <nitind>	defanco: In your running copy, use the Plug-In Spy on the wizard.
Jan 23 14:25:32 <Riku>	any idea why all my dialog windows are broken in neon.1a? they all extend outside the bound of the window, and as soon as I touch alt the extra parts disappear and become unclickable, even if I resize the window
Jan 23 14:26:03 <Riku>	does eclipse just really hate wayland?
Jan 23 14:27:33 <josteele>	defanco: it's in ..wst.web.
Jan 23 14:28:16 <Riku>	my issue is very very similar to this bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=484766
Jan 23 14:28:27 <Riku>	but this bug is reported fixed a year ago
Jan 23 14:29:14 <josteele>	defanco: SimpleWebProjectWizard
Jan 23 14:30:53 <defanco>	josteele, what is url for this git project?
Jan 23 14:32:08 <nitind>	http://git.eclipse.org/c/jeetools/webtools.javaee.git/tree/plugins/org.eclipse.wst.web , clone with https://git.eclipse.org/r/jeetools/webtools.javaee
Jan 23 14:32:21 <defanco>	thank you
Jan 23 14:34:55 <defanco>	nitind, are you familiar with WTP?
Jan 23 14:35:42 <nitind>	defanco: parts of it
Jan 23 14:39:07 <defanco>	nitind, I followed examples to extended WTP to add my own server runtime. I can add the definition in server preference page, but when I create web project I can't see my defined sever runtime there. If I add Apache sever I can see it in "Target Runtime" of Static Web Project wizard.
Jan 23 14:39:46 <defanco>	That's why I wanted to get source for that wizard so I can debug to see why it's not being populated with my sever definitions.
Jan 23 14:45:43 <nitind>	If this is a runtime workbench you're reusing, be sure to set the launch configuration to clear the configuration area at some point.
Jan 23 14:51:37 <defanco>	nitind, I did
Jan 23 14:52:54 <nitind>	Installing the SDK/dev resources feature would accomplis that.
Jan 23 14:53:31 <defanco>	With Apache I can define server runtime inside the wizard and it shows up. With mine I go throw steps of doing the same but it never shows up is server runtime combo box.
Jan 23 14:53:58 <defanco>	I have these features in my target definition.
Jan 23 18:48:07 <TML>	anyone here who can speak about https://bugs.eclipse.org ?
Jan 23 18:48:41 <TML>	It seems to be emailing me about things I don't recall subscribing to (let alone caring about), and I can't figure out how to unsubscribe
Jan 23 18:59:41 <juacado>	I have a system with three operating systems (Windows, macOS and Ubuntu) and I was thinking about trying to install Eclipse Platform plugins in a location where they can access...
Jan 23 18:59:54 <juacado>	so changes made when using one of them will persist when switching to another... does it make sense?
Jan 23 19:17:21 <josteele>	juacado: when you say 'persist when switching to another', do you mean after you've built the plugin from source, you then can install that plugin into all three different platforms (win, mac, linux)?
Jan 24 00:04:03 <LiftLeft>	where is neon eclipse stored on ubuntu?
Jan 24 00:13:45 <LiftLeft>	nvm
Jan 24 00:13:49 <LiftLeft>	I figured it out
Jan 24 01:44:38 <krishna>	mbooth: the "Eclipse-BundleShape: dir" option is working, but i have to give the libs location inside the directory(lib/some.jar) if I point something like (../lib/some.jar) or (./lib/some.jar) its not working. But by this method, It can only load the libraries which are already defined in the plugin-classpath.But if i want to load a jdbc jar, any jar provided by the user into my classpath or make it somehow to work without getting
Jan 24 01:44:45 <krishna>	is there a way
Jan 24 01:46:46 <krishna>	mbooth: suppose my application has a generic way to interact with database, so, what ever the jdbc jar is given, it should make use of it and work, so to add the jar into classpath doesn't work, something should be done at runtime, either loading the lib manually from that directory or something else.
Jan 24 02:14:35 <nitind>	The libraries your plug-in uses should entirely ship within the plug-in. What you're describing is what extension points are for.
Jan 24 03:26:09 <krishna>	nitind: But what if we have some libraries which we cant ship. Ex: jdbc jars can't be shipped with any product because of its licensing issues.
Jan 24 04:19:08 <Stummi>	Hello, I am using the sonarqube plugin in eclipse, but it seems changes in the sonarqubes rules do not reflect into eclipse (as in, when I disable rules in sonar they still appear in eclipse) - is there a way to fix that?
Jan 24 04:19:18 <barq>	I can't update Eclipse, it's stuck forever computing update requirements or containg software sites. I am behind a proxy but have configured it.
Jan 24 07:29:49 <xsse>	Hello. Is it possible to capitalize some back reference when using eclipse's Find/Search via Regex? I want to have sth like this: Input: find; Output: Find
Jan 24 07:29:54 <xsse>	I tried using \U, but that doesnt seem to work
Jan 24 12:00:33 <MrJones>	is there a channel somewhere for eclipse-che questions?
Jan 24 12:03:34 <MrJones>	in case it's here: is there some guide available on "stack authoring"? the docs link inside eclipse che just goes to a site telling me the docs aren't available yet
Jan 24 12:03:34 <mvvvv>	MrJones, #eclipseche
Jan 24 12:03:38 <MrJones>	ah ok, thx
Jan 24 13:33:11 <dowdle>	Question about installing Eclipse on a Windows 7 machine so all users can use it... I'm looking here but the answer isn't jumping out at me: http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ#How_do_I_start_Eclipse.3F
Jan 24 13:34:13 <dowdle>	I've installed Eclipse in a computer lab and when I run it as me it works... but when other users run it they get an error about it not being able to find needed libraries.  I'm sure this issue is covered in some FAQ somewhere.  Looking at the secuirty permissions on the C:\eclipse\ directory, things look good.  Any ideas?
Jan 24 13:40:18 <josteele>	dowdle: did you install Eclipse using Oomph or a pre-configured archive from eclipse.org?
Jan 24 13:41:12 <josteele>	dowdle: or i guess instead of Oomph i meant Eclipse Installer
Jan 24 13:43:17 <dowdle>	josteele: Historically via a zip file... but for the current install, I don't recall.
Jan 24 13:45:42 <josteele>	dowdle: i know the Eclipse installer pools a lot of the Eclipse plugins in the users's home directory under a directory named .eclipse I believe
Jan 24 13:58:41 <dowdle>	josteele: If Eclipse doesn't show in the Control Panel's Uninstall or change a program list, would that mean I did not use the installer?
Jan 24 14:01:11 <josteele>	dowdle: i'm not sure about that. Can download an archive from eclipse.org and test it out? How long ago did you install Eclipse?
Jan 24 15:40:19 <duanemoody>	I'm trying to make a remote FTP connection to a server where I'm only granted permissions on a subdirectory below root, but I don't see any files on the host
Jan 24 15:40:30 <duanemoody>	where do I specify the subdirectory?
Jan 24 15:41:56 <duanemoody>	is it supposed to be in the connection name, or elsewhere?
Jan 24 15:55:51 <duanemoody>	knock knock herro
Jan 24 16:01:37 <dowdle>	duanemoody: What are you using to make the connection?  SSH?  Some versioning utility that connections over SSH?  If one of those, it is probably an addon providing that... and there a zillion to pick from so who has a clue what you might be referring to?
Jan 24 16:02:16 <duanemoody>	nope, Remote FTP Only System Connection and tried it also with Windows Remote System
Jan 24 16:02:29 <duanemoody>	it likes my credentials but seems to be stuck at the server root
Jan 24 16:02:55 <dowdle>	duanemoody: If you are getting the top level... and you need some sub level... you should be able to drill down to where you need to be graphically.
Jan 24 16:03:17 <dowdle>	duanemoody: And if you can't figure it out... use a traditional FTP program and see what you see in it so you can get a better idea of what is where.
Jan 24 16:04:37 <duanemoody>	Traditional FTP into root shows me the entire subdirectories, so it's not that
Jan 24 16:05:39 <duanemoody>	likewise, it lets me FTP into the subdirectory

Jan 25 14:37:42 <RedSpartan>	im gonna try going down a version
Jan 25 14:43:19 <RedSpartan>	nothing
Jan 25 14:47:16 <josteele>	RedSpartan: it appears another bundle is also defining an slf4j binding. can you remove it from your manifest?
Jan 25 15:24:08 <nitind>	That's what you got from java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/annotation/PostConstruct ?
Jan 25 15:40:06 <RedSpartan>	i ran eclipse in the command line and it said that there were multiple bindings
Jan 25 15:40:18 <RedSpartan>	linux terminal
Jan 25 15:43:02 <RedSpartan>	im getting this at startup eclipse crashes. I have no projects its a fresh install. There were other eclipse installations before that. I may still have files leftover Ive tried my best to uninstall it all
Jan 25 15:43:53 <nitind>	Could you possibly have another binding installed into the JRE's folders?
Jan 25 15:44:29 <RedSpartan>	i have 3 jdk installations?
Jan 25 15:48:56 <RedSpartan>	i havent installed any plugins or anything just what comes with openjdk, oracle8 and 9 and eclipse
Jan 25 15:50:05 <mbooth>	RedSpartan: Looks like you are running on java 9 -- did you try running on java 8?
Jan 25 15:50:59 <RedSpartan>	ill try that
Jan 25 15:56:07 <RedSpartan>	ha yeah that worked
Jan 25 15:56:58 <mbooth>	RedSpartan: Java 9 is not a officially supported platform for Eclipse Neon: https://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?planurl=http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/eclipse_project_plan_4_6.xml#target_environments
Jan 25 15:57:21 <RedSpartan>	I can set it to use java8 in eclipse.ini can't i? I just add -vm <locaction>
Jan 25 15:57:32 <RedSpartan>	thanks
Jan 25 15:59:17 <mainframed>	Hey. Does somebody know where Eclipse/SWT/Java takes the default font size from (on linux). I have set all GTK font sizes to 13 but the font size in Eclipse is 7. Thanks alot :)
Jan 25 16:21:45 <kaje>	This is an eclipse e4 rcp question regard dependency injection.
Jan 25 16:22:22 <kaje>	How can I call a method that uses dependency injection from custom code and have object injected correctly?
Jan 25 16:23:46 <kaje>	More specifically, I have a handler class that has an @Execute method with an MApplication field defined on the class. When the handler is called by the command from clicking on a menu item, the MApplication field has the correct value.
Jan 25 16:24:23 <kaje>	But, if somewhere else in my code I create an instance of that handler class, the values of the fields are not injected.
Jan 25 16:40:17 <mistria>	kaje: when using dependency injection, you mustn't instantiate the classes
Jan 25 16:40:23 <mistria>	kaje: and retrieve them from context instead
Jan 25 16:43:28 <kaje>	How can I get the current context from my own code?
Jan 25 16:44:49 <mistria>	kaje: ContextInjectionFactory.make(MyHandler.class, context);
Jan 25 16:46:09 <kaje>	that makes sense. How do I get "context"?
Jan 25 16:46:32 <mistria>	kaje: PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getService(IEclipseContext.class) should work
Jan 25 16:46:43 <kaje>	Thank you!
Jan 25 16:46:47 <kaje>	I will try this.
Jan 25 16:47:46 <kaje>	PlatformUI is not e3, right? I'm trying to avoid the compatibility layer.
Jan 25 16:49:44 <mistria>	kaje: PlatformUI is e3
Jan 25 16:50:20 <mistria>	kaje: if your class that tries to call the handler is loaded through the context, you can simply `@Inject IEclipseContext context`
Jan 25 16:51:00 <mistria>	kaje: everything you can get through `getService` can usually be Injected
Jan 25 16:51:25 <kaje>	Ok, it is loaded by the context, so that should work.
Jan 25 16:52:09 <mainframed>	Ok. Problem partially solved. I tweaked GDK_SCALE and GDK_DPI_SCALE. Now all images and all text whose size I can change are small. The text I can enlarge the images are minor issue.
Jan 25 16:52:41 <mainframed>	But the explanation about DPI scaling on the release of neon does not apply to me.
Jan 25 16:53:05 <kaje>	That solution worked for me. Thanks very much!
Jan 25 17:10:16 <kaje>	New problem. I'm trying to add an object to the application context like so: application.getContext().set(pc.getClass(), pc.getClass().cast(pc));
Jan 25 17:10:32 <kaje>	This causes this error: The method set(String, Object) in the type IEclipseContext is not applicable for the arguments (Class<capture#1-of ? extends ProjectComponent>, capture#2-of ? extends ProjectComponent)
Jan 25 17:13:12 <kaje>	The problem is that the pc variable is a super type and I want to put the value into the context with the subclass type.
Jan 25 17:13:46 <kaje>	So, I don't know what that subclass type is here, but I thought that .getClass() would get it.

Jan 27 11:51:06 <altendky>	i'm having issues with eclipse (well, ti's ccstudio) parsing my #!/usr/bin/env python3 on windows rather than letting the py launcher handle it.  result is it tries to execute env which obviously fails.  the script is a c project pre-build step.  i've got it working on some installs and not others.  ideas?
Jan 27 11:52:29 <altendky>	https://bpaste.net/show/f307343933be
Jan 27 11:56:37 <mbooth>	altendky: My guess is you don't have "env" command available on Windows? As a workaround you could try editing the python file to say "#!/usr/bin/python3" instead
Jan 27 11:57:32 <altendky>	mbooth: you are correct i don't have env.  but, .py files are associated with the py launcher which will interpret the shebang.
Jan 27 11:58:48 <mbooth>	altendky: Right, but the shebang says "execute this file with env" and python3 is a parameter passed to env (env executes a program in a different environment)
Jan 27 11:58:50 <altendky>	mbooth: the makefile does have my script directly as opposed to 'env python <etc>' but it seems something is still getting in the middle and attempting to interpret the shebang.  but again only on some installs.
Jan 27 12:00:10 <altendky>	mbooth: yes, that is what the shebang says.  what is interpreting the shebang?  it seems to be something related to eclipse (ccstudio) since i can type my script name in cmd and it runs fine
Jan 27 12:01:24 <altendky>	mbooth: i'm trying to use something that works on windows and linux and until an update this worked because of the py launcher program that is associated with .py in windows
Jan 27 12:01:57 <altendky>	mbooth: i'm bringing up fresh virtuals right now and installing the different versions to try and figure out if there is a version difference or just some setting i forgot i set
Jan 27 12:02:21 <mbooth>	altendky: Okay well, I tried suggesting a workaround.
Jan 27 12:02:56 <mbooth>	IMO following what is specified in shebang line is the more correct behaviour. If you can't use env, change it.
Jan 27 12:03:10 <altendky>	mbooth: i very much appreciate your response.  i'm trying to figure out why it works in some ccstudio installs and not others.
Jan 27 12:04:14 <altendky>	mbooth: the correct action on windows would be to run the specified file, yes?  then windows would identify the association to the py launcher and it would work.  instead, something seems to be parsing the shebang and even modifying it (throwing out /usr/bin/).
Jan 27 13:35:43 <altendky>	mbooth: looks to be a feature introduction between gnu make 3.81 and 4.1 that decides to modify the shebang if it can't find it.  seems i will be stuck with some workaround, just have to decide which one.  thanks again for your time.

Jan 31 11:01:19 <aarondabomb>	Hi guys - I'm having trouble with one of my annotation processors. I'm trying to use Immutables (https://immutables.github.io/), and experiencing multiple issues. One is that the generated source is being generated properly in some instances. If I modify and save the offending mutable version of the file though, then it gets regenerated. Is there a way I can tell eclipse to regenerate all of this source?
Jan 31 11:10:04 <aarondabomb>	I should note that blowing away the generated source folder does not work. It's still regenerated improperly, lacking the Immutable type it was lacking before

Feb 02 10:30:17 <moonbase123>	Hi, I'm new to eclipse, and I'm wondering how I open packages from a different project I have saved?
Feb 02 10:30:57 <moonbase123>	like, I was working on something on my laptop, saved it to onedrive, and I don't know how to open it up again so I get all the packages on the left side
Feb 02 10:32:32 <moonbase_>	Hi, I'm new to eclipse, and I'm wondering how I open packages from a different project I have saved? like, I was working on something on my laptop, saved it to onedrive, and I don't know how to open it up again so I get all the packages on the left side
Feb 02 10:32:49 <mbooth>	moonbase_:  What do you mean by "saved it to onedrive" ? You moved your workspace?
Feb 02 10:33:24 <moonbase_>	I guess that's what I did, but I'm still learning how all that works
Feb 02 10:33:38 <moonbase_>	is "workspace" the package viewer on the left?
Feb 02 10:34:14 <mbooth>	moonbase_: I mean the workspace directory. I don't know what onedrive is, so I'm trying to understand what you actually did....
Feb 02 10:34:29 <moonbase_>	onedrive is a cloud storage in windows10
Feb 02 10:34:49 <moonbase_>	so I'm trying to pickup on my PC where I left off on my laptop
Feb 02 10:35:00 <moonbase_>	by making them save to the same cloud folder
Feb 02 10:35:49 <mbooth>	Okay, so back to original question, what does "saving" to one drive entail?
Feb 02 10:36:02 <mbooth>	Like, what did you actually do to save to this cloud service?
Feb 02 10:36:20 <moonbase_>	ok when java asked me to choose a workspace, I picked a folder on onecloud
Feb 02 10:36:50 <mbooth>	moonbase_: Okay, so on your other pc, when it asks for workspace, did you choose the same onecloud directory?
Feb 02 10:37:22 <moonbase_>	I think I might have chosen a different one
Feb 02 10:37:39 <moonbase_>	what is the workspace though?
Feb 02 10:37:54 <mbooth>	moonbase_: The workspace is the directory that contains your projects
Feb 02 10:38:03 <moonbase_>	oh
Feb 02 10:38:51 <moonbase_>	I *think* the way I have it setup now is that the workspace on my pc is just called "workspace" folder on onedrive, while on my laptop, I made the workspace something like "Chapter 2 problems"
Feb 02 10:39:06 <moonbase_>	should I move the chapter 2 problems to "workspace" folder and then change the workspace on my laptop to that? would that fix it?
Feb 02 10:40:44 <moonbase_>	ok im just gonna try to simply explain what is up, because I'm so confused
Feb 02 10:40:55 <moonbase_>	I started on my PC and made the workspace a folder called "workspace" on onedrive
Feb 02 10:41:03 <moonbase_>	then in that folder, I made a java file that I did some work on
Feb 02 10:41:20 <moonbase_>	then on my laptop, I *think* I made the workspace a different folder by accident, and started 2 java files there
Feb 02 10:42:17 <moonbase_>	now ideally I want to sync them basically so I can pick up work regardless of whether I'm on my PC or laptop, but right now I don't even know how to open the files on my PC that I did on my laptop
Feb 02 10:42:36 <moonbase_>	I can open the individual files, but they're not showing up with the whole package map thing
Feb 02 10:43:01 <mbooth>	moonbase_: Restart Eclipse, and choose the other workspace directory to see your other projects...
Feb 02 10:43:06 <mbooth>	moonbase_: On all computers you'd have to choose the same workspace directory (how else would it know about projects you worked on from your other computer?)
Feb 02 10:43:47 <mbooth>	moonbase_: To consolidate your workspaces, you can import projects
Feb 02 10:44:57 <moonbase_>	ok I've restarted java and tried to switch my workspace back to "workspace" on my PC, but it's still just showing the files from my laptop that I managed to get up, minus the package thing
Feb 02 10:45:02 <moonbase_>	I'll ss, 1 sec
Feb 02 10:45:50 <moonbase_>	http://i.imgur.com/9uX2FQg.png?1
Feb 02 10:46:26 <moonbase_>	I'm on my PC, and those are the two files that I made on my laptop, but as you see they're not in packages or anything, and now I can't find my package setup for the file I originally made on pc
Feb 02 10:47:15 <mbooth>	moonbase_: It looks like you didn't create a java project -- just a general project
Feb 02 10:47:30 <moonbase_>	but they were in packages and stuff :/
Feb 02 10:47:35 <moonbase_>	but now they're just appearing as files
Feb 02 10:48:52 <nitind>	A Java Project is a distinct thing you create using a wizard.
Feb 02 10:49:17 <moonbase_>	yeah but I did originally create a java project using the wizard
Feb 02 10:49:27 <moonbase_>	and it shows up in packages and stuff
Feb 02 10:49:35 <moonbase_>	but now I can't seem to open it again like that
Feb 02 10:49:55 <mbooth>	moonbase_: It doesn't look that way from screenshot -- either way it's easy to fix -- You can create a proper java project "File->New->Java project" and then move your files into the new project
Feb 02 10:51:02 <moonbase_>	ok great, that kinda worked
Feb 02 10:51:08 <moonbase_>	but now let's say I work on this
Feb 02 10:51:16 <moonbase_>	and I want to continue work on my laptop
Feb 02 10:51:25 <moonbase_>	what do I have to do to just be able to continue working with everything the same?
Feb 02 10:51:39 <mbooth>	Just always open the same workspace directory
Feb 02 10:52:06 <mbooth>	(Make sure to close Eclipse on one computer before opening the workspace on another computer)
Feb 02 10:54:58 <mbooth>	moonbase_: Maybe it would help to understand the directory layout of workspaces... https://paste.fedoraproject.org/543084/48605087/
Feb 02 11:00:07 <nitind>	It's best not to store the *workspace* directory in a cloud sync system. You can try putting projects in them, but the workspace contains machine-specific information.
Feb 02 11:15:30 <moonbase_>	sorry was on the phone
Feb 02 11:16:00 <moonbase_>	last question mbooth  if you're still there, I just made a new java project in my "workspace" folder, which I'm going to make sure my laptop's workspace is set on as well
Feb 02 11:16:20 <moonbase_>	but there's another folder in the workspace folder that isn't showing up on the left
Feb 02 11:16:22 <moonbase_>	how do I find it again?
Feb 02 11:17:10 <moonbase_>	img here http://i.imgur.com/WEjBWwd.png?1
Feb 02 11:23:07 <mbooth>	moonbase_: "Learning Java"?
Feb 02 11:23:16 <moonbase_>	yes
Feb 02 11:23:42 <mbooth>	moonbase_: You can do, for example, "File->Import->Existing project into workspace"
Feb 02 11:23:56 <mbooth>	If there is valid Eclipse project in that dir
Feb 02 11:24:24 <moonbase_>	ok, so that's what I'm going to have to do when I log onto my laptop to continue working, right? I have to import the new Deitel folder I made where I'm going to be making java classes for the problems
Feb 02 11:24:55 <mbooth>	Well, no -- the workspace is shared between computers right?
Feb 02 11:25:26 <moonbase_>	when I log onto my laptop I'm going to have to double check that the workspace is set to the workspace folder
Feb 02 11:25:54 <moonbase_>	if it's not, I guess my first step will be to set workspace as the workspace folder, right? workspace folder being the name of the folder my PC workspace is
Feb 02 11:26:20 <mbooth>	Yes
Feb 02 11:27:55 <mbooth>	moonbase_: As long as you quit Eclipse on your PC (and file system changes are sync'ed to the cloud)... before you start work on your laptop it should be "okay"
Feb 02 11:28:04 <mbooth>	I mean the "real" solution here is to use some kind of source control (as nitind says, you're really not meant to share workspaces in this way)
Feb 02 11:30:07 <moonbase_>	ok thanks
Feb 02 18:18:15 <dowdle>	Trying to help an Ubuntu 16.04 user install the latest Eclipse Neon 2 .tar.gz installer from the Eclipse.org site download thingie.  ldd'ing the installer executable shows no missing libraries but it won't run.  It gives the following error: "Eclipse Intaller: An error has orccured.  See log file null. [Close]".  Same installer works fine for me on Fedora 25.
Feb 02 18:19:05 <dowdle>	The Ubuntu user in question has what appears to me to be the needed openjdk packages installed (as I do on Fedora).  We aren't using the official Oracle JDK... but I would hope that would not hurt the Eclipse installer.
Feb 02 18:19:07 <dowdle>	Any ideas?
Feb 02 18:19:25 <dowdle>	He says Ubuntu does package it but what they packages for 16.04 is dated.
Feb 02 18:19:52 <mbooth>	dowdle: Yeah ubuntu packages are super old -- Fedora packages are up to date though
Feb 02 18:20:06 <mbooth>	dowdle: Does ubuntu use wayland by default?
Feb 02 18:20:19 <mbooth>	Could try using X11 backend
Feb 02 18:20:43 <dowdle>	mbooth: No, only Fedora has adopted Wayland as default and only with the GNOME / Workstation product.
Feb 02 18:20:50 <dowdle>	User is using Unity.
Feb 02 18:21:39 <mbooth>	dowdle: "See log file null" is wierd, do you get any output from: $ ./eclipse -consoleLog
Feb 02 18:22:10 <winsoff>	dowdle, does your user have the same bug my friend has, where clicking to add a breakpoint on the line-number-area adds it 10-15 lines lower than you would expect?
Feb 02 18:23:01 <dowdle>	mbooth: The installer immediately gives that error... so it doesn't get far enough to download anything... so I believe there is no ./eclipse to try unless it is in the installer directory?
Feb 02 18:23:18 <dowdle>	mbooth: Only executable in the top level installer dir is eclipse-inst
Feb 02 18:23:41 <mbooth>	dowdle: Ohhhh, I am unfamiliar with the installer -- I thought you were using the traditional tarball download
Feb 02 18:23:47 <dowdle>	winsoff: Since we are having issues with the installer... and don't have Eclipse yet, I'm guessing no.
Feb 02 18:24:30 <winsoff>	dowdle, let me know when you get it fixed. Har har.
Feb 02 18:24:34 <dowdle>	mbooth: It is the tar.gz file but it is... https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/neon/R2a/eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz Which has inst in the name.
Feb 02 18:25:18 <mbooth>	dowdle: Okay I can't help you in that case, sorry. I can only suggest trying the traditional tarball distros: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/
Feb 02 18:25:20 <dowdle>	mbooth: That's what the default download button gives me anyway.  Can try a binary .tar.gz.  Must find a URL first though.
Feb 02 18:27:41 *	dowdle gives that a try.
Feb 02 18:29:28 <dowdle>	The full .tar.gz worked.  Thanks.  I'm going to hit-and-run now.  Until next time.
Feb 02 18:32:11 <winsoff>	Rude.
Feb 02 18:32:20 <winsoff>	Could have at least told me if he could set a breakpoint.
Feb 03 04:36:03 <Stummi>	not sure if this is a bug or not: When I use the "insert dependency" dialog, select a search result without version and press enter it creates me a whole empty <dependency> block. I would expect it to create a dependency block without version info then
Feb 03 11:02:53 <nitind>	Stummi: What "insert dependency" dialog do you mean? You've got a huge number of plug-ins and languages that require some context to make that clearer.
Feb 03 11:08:32 <Stummi>	nitind, sorry. I meant in the pom.xml editor
Feb 03 11:08:53 <Stummi>	having the cursor in the <dependencies> block, then pressing ctrl+space, then selecting "insert dependency"
Feb 03 11:13:08 <nitind>	I thought this was about a dialog?

Feb 03 17:28:47 <gregory_>	Hello #eclipse I just recenlty installed Neon.2 onto an Ubuntu 16.04 system using the tarball install. I seem to get an error when trying to make a work space in its start up. Does anyone know the fix for this issue?
Feb 03 17:30:12 <nitind>	Not unless you tell us what the error is. I mean, it could be *anything* otherwise. Filesystem permissions. Neutrinos. Interdimensional commando hippos.
Feb 03 17:37:39 <gregory_>	Sorry still new to debugging Ubuntu. Looking into it now for specifics just checking to see if there was anyone who might know. I get 2 seperate error warnings in the .log file (Application Error, FrameworkEvent ERROR)

Feb 07 14:26:48 <poseid>	hi, i am confused how to add a resources folder to my java project (for runtime and testing)
Feb 07 14:27:10 <poseid>	by default there is src / main / java
Feb 07 14:27:31 <poseid>	but not sure where to add the src / main / resource, e.g. what category in the "new ..." menu to select
Feb 07 14:31:07 <poseid>	on a sidenote what is the difference between eclipse luna and eclipse mars ?
Feb 07 14:35:34 <poseid>	ok, via the configure build path works http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27934796/how-do-i-add-a-resources-folder-to-my-java-project-in-eclipse
Feb 07 14:48:07 <JJDeveloper>	I am hoping for some help getting a Jar Signing file (ZZZ.pem) from GoDaddy loaded into Eclipse.   In Eclipse I run File => Export and then in mu bundle, there is a place to specify the Keystore Location, Keypass, Alias, and Password.  I am not sure how to get from the PEM file to the Keystore that Eclipse expects

Feb 07 16:03:27 <lilalinux>	eclipse (actually Spring Tool Suite) fails to compile: Comparator<Foo> comp = Comparator.comparing(Foo::getBar); but the method exists (through lombok, but also if done manually). Is that an eclipse bug or am I really doing something wrong? "The type Foo does not define getBar(T) that is applicable here"
Feb 07 18:14:44 <vdv>	hello everyone I'm experiencing problem when I try to add Glassfish server, there's an exception in create wizard: https://bpaste.net/show/3333976242e4
Feb 07 18:16:31 <vdv>	is there an issue in sapphire or glassfish tools?
Feb 08 04:12:05 <ImUs3r>	i can’t download eclipse what’s wrong?
Feb 08 04:54:00 <surial_>	lilalinux: make sure it's the latest versoin of lombok, and doubleclick lombok to have lombok 'fix' your eclipse.
Feb 08 04:54:33 <lilalinux>	surial_: it's not a lombok problem, also happens with manually written getters
Feb 08 04:54:47 <lilalinux>	the problem is, I wanted to use a custom class as sort field
Feb 08 04:54:56 <lilalinux>	which apparently isn't possible
Feb 08 04:56:01 <surial_>	lilalinux: what happens if you try Comparator.<Foo>comparing(...
Feb 08 04:56:15 <lilalinux>	.<Foo>?
Feb 08 04:56:25 <lilalinux>	didn't know that syntax before
Feb 08 04:56:54 <surial_>	yeah, that's forcing the generics on the call, just to eliminate that it's a problem with inference.
Feb 08 04:56:55 <lilalinux>	or is that a typo?
Feb 08 04:57:07 <surial_>	Because the getBar() method, effectively has one param of type Foo so this really should just work fine.
Feb 08 04:57:19 <surial_>	it's not a type. Comparator.<Foo>comparing(Foo::getBar)
Feb 08 04:57:56 <lilalinux>	I'll try that, thank you
Feb 08 04:58:14 <lilalinux>	surial_: do you know, how I can specify a field to sort one level deeper?
Feb 08 04:58:25 <lilalinux>	like Foo::getBar::getId
Feb 08 04:58:57 <ImUs3r>	i installed https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572?locale=en_US  so how can i uninstall it?
Feb 08 05:02:41 <ImUs3r>	lilalinux: ?
Feb 08 05:03:40 <lilalinux>	ImUs3r: no idea
Feb 08 05:03:46 <lilalinux>	why do you want to remove it?
Feb 08 05:04:10 <ImUs3r>	because i want to install new version that is old version
Feb 08 05:05:02 <ImUs3r>	lilalinux: ?
Feb 08 05:05:39 <lilalinux>	ImUs3r: maybe ask in #MacOSX or ##java
Feb 08 05:06:04 <ImUs3r>	thanks
Feb 08 06:55:52 <surial_>	ImUs3r: Just install oracle's thingie from oracle when googling for 'oracle jdk mac'.

Feb 09 04:00:53 <ImUs3r>	Mars is newest?
Feb 09 04:05:21 <mvvvv>	ImUs3r, Neon is the last released
Feb 09 04:05:32 <mvvvv>	Neon.2
Feb 09 04:05:53 <ImUs3r>	what is Oxygen?
Feb 09 04:06:18 <mvvvv>	the next one
Feb 09 04:07:36 <mvvvv>	Oxygen will be released June28,2017
Feb 09 04:08:12 <ImUs3r>	ok then EE vs java vs c/c++ vs android vs php vs .........
Feb 09 04:08:17 <ImUs3r>	which is good?
Feb 09 04:08:36 <mvvvv>	what are you looking for ?
Feb 09 04:08:42 <ImUs3r>	java
Feb 09 04:08:59 <ImUs3r>	what is EE?
Feb 09 04:09:22 <mvvvv>	Entreprise Edition
Feb 09 04:09:27 <mvvvv>	for the web
Feb 09 04:09:37 <ImUs3r>	enterprise edition is good?
Feb 09 04:10:07 <mvvvv>	if you want to create servlet JSP or JSF and EJB ... yes
Feb 09 04:10:20 <ImUs3r>	i think that EE is most popular
Feb 09 04:10:34 <ImUs3r>	i can’t do android with EE?
Feb 09 04:11:10 <mvvvv>	no , you can install many eclipse packaging with Eclipse Installer
Feb 09 04:12:09 <mvvvv>	for android the eclipse product is Eclipse for Android Developers
Feb 09 04:12:44 <ImUs3r>	ok
Feb 09 04:12:45 <ImUs3r>	thanks
Feb 09 04:12:47 <mvvvv>	you can also download EE and add the plugins for android
Feb 09 04:12:47 <ImUs3r>	:)
Feb 09 04:12:59 <ImUs3r>	oh then EE is basic?
Feb 09 04:13:09 <mvvvv>	no
Feb 09 04:13:29 <mvvvv>	the basic is Eclipse Standard
Feb 09 04:13:48 <mvvvv>	the minimal is Eclipse Platform
Feb 09 04:14:31 <mvvvv>	then you add the plugins you want. But it's better to install one packaging for a given purpose
Feb 09 04:14:56 <ImUs3r>	ok thanks then i will install EE
Feb 09 04:15:39 <mvvvv>	not accurate if you don't want to create web developments
Feb 09 04:16:18 <ImUs3r>	i want to do pyDev
Feb 09 04:16:20 <ImUs3r>	:)
Feb 09 04:16:22 <ImUs3r>	with EE
Feb 09 04:16:30 <ImUs3r>	it is ok?
Feb 09 04:17:18 <mvvvv>	EE will download huge plugins you don't need at all
Feb 09 04:17:44 <ImUs3r>	i can’t do pyDev with EE?
Feb 09 04:18:36 <mvvvv>	you can but you'll waste your mem with unusefull plugins
Feb 09 04:18:54 <ImUs3r>	dont worry
Feb 09 04:18:59 <ImUs3r>	i have 2G mem
Feb 09 04:19:01 <ImUs3r>	:)
Feb 09 04:19:16 <mvvvv>	low
Feb 09 04:19:32 <ImUs3r>	lol
Feb 09 04:19:40 <ImUs3r>	2G is bigger than 512 mb
Feb 09 04:20:07 <mvvvv>	java and eclipse take a lot of mem
Feb 09 04:20:19 <ImUs3r>	how much?
Feb 09 04:21:43 <mvvvv>	it depends on the unusefull plugins you launched with eclipse
Feb 09 04:22:20 <ImUs3r>	how many plugins EE have?
Feb 09 04:23:54 <mvvvv>	too many
Feb 09 04:24:27 <mbooth>	ImUs3r: For using PyDev, the basic Eclipse for Java Developers edition is fine
Feb 09 04:25:44 <ImUs3r>	Eclipse IDE for Java Developers  <— you mean this?
Feb 09 04:26:16 <mbooth>	Yes, it is the smallest download, so is less likely to contain stuff you don't need
Feb 09 04:26:35 <ImUs3r>	but i want to do jsp in the future
Feb 09 04:26:51 <mbooth>	You can always add more plugins at a later time
Feb 09 04:27:01 <ImUs3r>	oh really
Feb 09 04:27:09 <ImUs3r>	then i will use java only
Feb 09 04:27:10 <ImUs3r>	:)
Feb 09 05:26:45 <Tobbi_>	Is there anyone here who can help me with Jubula?
Feb 09 05:28:19 <Tobbi_>	Basically, object mapping mode doesn't seem to be working.
Feb 09 05:28:34 <Tobbi_>	I can't select any elements in the AUT.
Feb 09 07:43:32 <poseid>	hmm.. this has been asked before but i can't see quickly what makes eclipse luna and eclipse mars different?
Feb 09 07:44:02 <mbooth>	poseid: Mars is a newer version compared with Luna
Feb 09 07:44:57 <mbooth>	poseid: You can read the "New & Noteworthy" documents to see the improvements made in the Mars edition: https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.5/
Feb 09 07:45:22 <mbooth>	poseid: But worth pointing out that the current newest version is "Neon"
Feb 09 07:45:48 <mbooth>	poseid: See https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.6/ for changes made in Neon
Feb 09 07:46:09 <poseid>	i see, ok - 4.5, 4.6
Feb 09 07:46:10 <poseid>	thanks
Feb 09 07:47:01 <mbooth>	poseid: These days the "name" of the release is alphabetical (like with Ubuntu) so the later on in the alphabet, the newer it is
Feb 09 07:57:20 <poseid>	ok, background is that i live the java development with eclipse, and now want to try the same with c and c++
Feb 09 07:57:33 <poseid>	so, will be running multiple eclipse instances on the computer
Feb 09 08:03:07 <poseid>	ok, just trying some quick things, when trying to build a c++ on windows and an embedded c project with cross compilation, i likely need to have 2 different workspaces on the eclipse instance?
Feb 09 08:03:44 <poseid>	also, just loud thinking, when i would try to build embedded code for an esp32 which has a different compiler than e.g. an arm core mcu, i also would need to run 2 workspaces
Feb 09 08:05:02 <mbooth>	poseid: I don't think you *need* different workspaces though; IIRC you can configure different toolchain for each project within a workspace
Feb 09 08:05:24 <poseid>	ok, that sounds logical too
Feb 09 08:10:17 <poseid>	ok, feels like gcc is nicely supported, but now wondering how to build a c++ windows app - maybe via llvm ?
Feb 09 08:11:56 <mbooth>	poseid: I have no experience build windows apps, but I'd assume that mingw compilers can be used
Feb 09 08:12:35 <mbooth>	poseid: http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.cdt.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fcdt_c_before_you_begin.htm
Feb 09 08:12:42 <poseid>	also https://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Eclipse looks interesting
Feb 09 08:13:08 <poseid>	what is a CDT ?
Feb 09 08:13:52 <mbooth>	poseid: CDT == C/C++ Development Tooling -- AKA, the C/C++ plugin for Eclipse
Feb 09 08:13:59 <poseid>	:)

Feb 09 10:33:30 <Case_Of_>	on something like wasd
Feb 09 10:33:50 <nitind>	Check your ~keys preference page...and don't you need those keys for those characters?
Feb 09 10:33:50 <Arbalest>	For a list of available key bindings press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + L. To configure your key bindings, press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + L twice, or from the menu bar, Window > Preferences > General > Keys. See also http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ#What.27s_the_key_for_....3F
Feb 09 10:34:06 <nitind>	Eclipse isn't modal like vi.
Feb 09 10:34:40 <Case_Of_>	nitind: maybe with a key combination like one of those for dead characters
Feb 09 10:37:22 <Case_Of_>	nitind: like alt+gr
Feb 09 10:39:46 <Case_Of_>	does it support alt gr?
Feb 09 10:40:27 <nitind>	I don't know what that means. I use a US keyboard setting.
Feb 09 10:43:45 <Case_Of_>	nitind: the Alt Gr key
Feb 09 10:43:52 <Case_Of_>	don't you have it?
Feb 09 10:44:52 <mbooth>	Case_Of_: Some machines don't have it (maybe Macs?)
Feb 09 10:48:50 <Case_Of_>	oh
Feb 09 10:49:26 <Case_Of_>	by the way in settings I haven't found where to edit the keybinds for arrows
Feb 09 10:49:47 <Case_Of_>	inside the list in Preferences General Keys
Feb 09 11:10:17 <nitind>	mbooth: US keyboards do not have it.

Feb 09 14:20:12 <poseid_>	hi.... where do i set the build path of an existing c project with eclipse neon
Feb 09 14:23:22 <poseid_>	ok somewhere on the build path

Feb 10 11:00:21 <Toaster__>	is here any eclipse code recommender contributors?
Feb 10 11:02:16 <Toaster__>	Guys?
Feb 10 11:09:26 <Toaster__>	OR maybe eclipse platform contributors?
Feb 10 11:10:24 <mbooth>	Toaster__: It's okay to just ask your question, someone might know the answer :-)
Feb 10 11:12:18 <Toaster__>	Oh it's cool,you see,I am novice in open source development,and I 'd like to get started with eclipse as I am using it and  love it.So I wanted to ask about the most beginner-friendly part of eclipse,and tasks.
Feb 10 11:12:50 <mbooth>	Toaster__: Did you read https://eclipse.org/contribute/ ?
Feb 10 11:14:29 <Toaster__>	Thanks for that link,it looks more helpful than this one https://wiki.eclipse.org/Google_Summer_of_Code I was exploring.

Feb 14 03:53:04 <metrixx_>	hi.
Feb 14 03:53:39 <metrixx_>	i backup my workspace and copied it to my fresh new windows installation to the same folder path
Feb 14 03:53:54 <metrixx_>	i also copied eclipse exactly the same folder path
Feb 14 03:54:06 <metrixx_>	when i run eclipse, it shows projects duplicated
Feb 14 03:54:21 <metrixx_>	i fixed build path issues but it is still same..
Feb 14 03:54:28 <metrixx_>	can you help me about this?
Feb 14 03:57:26 <mvvvv>	metrixx_, you should create a new workspace then import projects from the old one
Feb 14 04:00:40 <metrixx_>	hmm
Feb 14 04:00:46 <metrixx_>	thank you
Feb 14 15:22:27 <fabio70mi>	Hi to all, small question about Eclipse: is there a way to define a build variable used by all projects in a workspace, without using workspace configuration ?   Because in our workgroup, workspace is personal, and projects are stored in VCS. So every developer should be able to create empty workspace, and later get projects from VCS and being able to build.
Feb 14 15:49:26 <nitind>	What is "a build variable"?
Feb 14 15:52:55 <rgrunber>	ahh.. could fabio70mi be referring to the HIPPs ?
Feb 14 15:55:22 <rgrunber>	fabio70mi ? ^ Hudson instance
Feb 14 15:55:37 <fabio70mi>	nitind: right click on project->C/C++ Build->Build Variables
Feb 14 15:55:51 <rgrunber>	(swing and a miss).. nvm
Feb 14 15:59:32 <fabio70mi>	I define a build variable like  DBVER=R03.03.00   and in C/C++ Build->Settings->Tool Settings->Includes I add an include path like C:/somewhere/${DBVER}/include  and do something similar for libraries path

Feb 16 12:14:53 <svip>	So are there any tutorials for installing Eclipse?
Feb 16 12:15:15 <svip>	When I run the eclipse-inst file, it just breaks.
Feb 16 12:15:32 <svip>	java.lang.RuntimeException: Error initializing storage.
Feb 16 12:16:57 <svip>	Strangely, it works with root.  But then it kept suggesting installing in /root and using /root as workspace.  And that seemed wrong.
Feb 16 12:17:20 <svip>	I certainly don't want to be running Eclipse as root.
Feb 16 12:17:52 <mbooth>	svip: Which Linux?
Feb 16 12:18:13 <svip>	Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
Feb 16 12:18:27 <mvvvv>	which java jdk or jre ?
Feb 16 12:18:37 <svip>	openjdk version "9-internal"
Feb 16 12:18:47 <mvvvv>	bad
Feb 16 12:18:58 <mvvvv>	openjdk-8
Feb 16 12:21:43 <svip>	Now I use openjdk version "1.8.0_121"
Feb 16 12:21:45 <svip>	Same error.
Feb 16 12:22:47 <mvvvv>	java -version
Feb 16 12:22:56 <svip>	Indeed.
Feb 16 12:23:06 <svip>	OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-8u121-b13-0ubuntu1.16.04.2-b13)
Feb 16 12:27:12 <mvvvv>	svip, did you get the last eclipse installer from eclipse.org ?
Feb 16 12:27:42 <svip>	Yes.
Feb 16 12:28:12 <mvvvv>	where did you unzip it ?
Feb 16 12:28:24 <svip>	In my homedir?
Feb 16 12:29:29 <mvvvv>	yes
Feb 16 12:29:39 <svip>	I did.
Feb 16 12:30:44 <mvvvv>	can you paste the whole stack trace please ?
Feb 16 12:31:25 <svip>	mvvvv: https://paste.ubuntu.com/24008399/

Feb 16 12:32:29 <svip>	Yes.
Feb 16 12:33:03 <mvvvv>	can you unzip in /home/svip/eclipse-inst
Feb 16 12:33:08 <svip>	mvvvv: Ah, I see what happened.
Feb 16 12:33:22 <svip>	I ran it as root, and now it doesn't work.

Feb 16 13:09:50 <M-dot>	Hi, I would like some guidance on this. I'm using Eclipse Java EE and vmware flex client sdk. When I go to the SERVERS tab and try to Add/Remove resources I get this message "There are no resources that can be added or removed from the server." Tried going to (project) Properties > Project Facets and ticking 'Dynamic Web Module, Java, JavaScript' on my project (ui and service) with no avail.
Feb 16 13:10:26 <M-dot>	If anyone has run into this and solved this before, please let me know.
Feb 16 13:11:28 <nitind>	What kind of server is it? Does it support Java EE web apps?
Feb 16 13:11:58 <M-dot>	Virgo Runtime Server
Feb 16 13:12:34 <M-dot>	And Yes.
Feb 16 13:16:52 <nitind>	Which version of Dynamic Web Module did you set? What kind of Virgo Runtime Server is it?
Feb 16 13:19:12 <M-dot>	I will find out how to figure out what version Dynamic Web Module (I'm new to this), but for Virgo Runtime I assume you're looking for this: Version: 1.5.0.201702160139-SNAPSHOT
Feb 16 13:20:49 <M-dot>	So Eclipse RT Virgo Server, Dynamic Web Module 3.0
Feb 16 13:21:53 <M-dot>	I notice when I expand on Project Facets > Eclipse RT Virgo Server I see three things: Eclipse RT OSGi Bundle 1.0, EclipseRT PAR 1.0, EclipseRT Plan 2.0
Feb 16 13:21:59 <M-dot>	Those are currently unchecked.
Feb 16 13:29:08 <altendky>	i have a large structure shown in the debugger expressions view and i would like to compare it between execution of two different programs.  can i export the structure and values to a file?  if so i could then simply diff the files.

Feb 17 11:01:34 <TMM>	hi all! I'm trying to follow these instructions to install oprofile in cdt properly: http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.doc%2FLinux_Tools_Project%2FOProfile%2FUser_Guide%2FInstallation-and-Set-Up.html
Feb 17 11:01:46 <TMM>	it seems though that the new eclipse installer places files in a different location or format
Feb 17 11:01:52 <TMM>	and I can't find the mentioned installation script
Feb 17 11:02:04 <TMM>	I have installed eclipse CDT for neon using the oomph installer
Feb 17 11:02:48 <mbooth>	TMM: What platform?
Feb 17 11:02:55 <TMM>	Linux64
Feb 17 11:03:54 <mbooth>	TMM: Which Linux?
Feb 17 11:04:12 <TMM>	Fedora 25
Feb 17 11:05:26 <mbooth>	TMM: Hmm, on Fedora I recommend using the package manager to install CDT/Linuxtools -- it should work out of the box
Feb 17 11:05:46 <TMM>	yeah, but fedora comes with a relatively old eclipse
Feb 17 11:05:59 <mbooth>	TMM: F25 has Neon.2
Feb 17 11:06:17 <TMM>	did they do a post-release upgrade?
Feb 17 11:06:24 <TMM>	I'm pretty sure when I ran it the first time it was something older
Feb 17 11:06:56 <TMM>	fedora comes with CDT 9.1.0 though, I'm running 9.2.0
Feb 17 11:07:02 <TMM>	I guess that's maybe not such a big deal
Feb 17 11:07:12 <mbooth>	TMM: F25 has CDT 9.2.0
Feb 17 11:07:25 <TMM>	not according to dnf info on my box
Feb 17 11:07:25 <mbooth>	Yes, we publish updates to released Fedoras :-)
Feb 17 11:07:33 <nitind>	Go Fedora.
Feb 17 11:08:09 <TMM>	still in updates-testing perhaps?
Feb 17 11:08:26 <TMM>	Did you like, update to 9.2.0 today? after a dnf --refresh it's there :P
Feb 17 11:08:28 <TMM>	I'll try it
Feb 17 11:08:49 <mbooth>	TMM: CDT 9.2.0 made it to stable more than a week ago: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-e86e3c8e50
Feb 17 11:09:08 <nitind>	dnf update --refresh ?
Feb 17 11:09:17 <TMM>	weird
Feb 17 11:10:20 <TMM>	mbooth, can I still install packages using the eclipse package manager too? I only need one that's not packaged in fedora it seems. The project I'm working on uses scons
Feb 17 11:10:53 <mbooth>	TMM: Yes, that should also work
Feb 17 11:11:21 <TMM>	mbooth, your patience with me is much appreciated. Thanks. :)
Feb 17 11:11:27 <mbooth>	np :-)
Feb 17 11:13:21 <CAP2982>	Hi, I am trying to debug a problem using a Remote Application configuration to run a C++ project. I am using last Eclipse luna CDT. Is there a way to enable as much debug as possible, to see what Eclipse is doing behind the scenes when I click 'Run' (or 'Debug')?
Feb 17 11:13:24 <CAP2982>	It seems to get stuck at some point, I would like to debug it
Feb 17 11:14:22 <mbooth>	CAP2982: Luna is very old, I would try in the latest Eclipse to see if it is fixed there first
Feb 17 11:23:12 <TMM>	mbooth, I get the exact same results using the fedora packaged version, oprofile doesn't work out of the box.
Feb 17 11:24:51 <mbooth>	TMM: Ah, damn. That's probably a packaging bug then -- it's been a while since I used oprofile
Feb 17 11:25:02 <mbooth>	TMM: How does it fail?
Feb 17 11:25:24 <TMM>	mbooth, it doesn't install the 'opcontrol' wrapper and policykit file
Feb 17 11:25:34 <TMM>	/usr/share/eclipse/droplets/linuxtools-oprofile/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.core_3.0.0.201701251131/natives/linux
Feb 17 11:25:37 <TMM>	it leaves them in there
Feb 17 11:26:18 <TMM>	hmm, no I guess it's missing entirely
Feb 17 11:26:41 <TMM>	exec pkexec /usr/bin/opcontrol ${1+"$@"} <-- calling that from /usr/bin/opcontrol is probably going to cause some somewhat disappointing results
Feb 17 11:28:27 <mbooth>	policy file should be found in /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.policy
Feb 17 11:28:49 <TMM>	yeah, but there's no 'opcontrol' file in /usr/bin
Feb 17 11:28:59 <mbooth>	Aha, I see
Feb 17 11:29:53 <TMM>	mbooth, you're right though, it does install the policy file but it also has a copy in linux/natives
Feb 17 11:29:56 <TMM>	mbooth, that confused me
Feb 17 11:35:24 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Hi, do you have insight for TMM s issue here^?
Feb 17 11:35:34 <mbooth>	rgrunber: I see your fingerprints on https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1138766 :-)
Feb 17 11:35:45 *	rgrunber looks
Feb 17 11:36:27 <TMM>	mbooth, it does seem to use 'operf'
Feb 17 11:36:40 <TMM>	but running operf as a regular user doesn't work
Feb 17 11:37:48 <mbooth>	rgrunber: Is simply doing s/opcontrol/operf/ in the policy file sufficient? (I'm no oprofile expert)
Feb 17 11:38:22 <rgrunber>	mbooth: operf should not require elevated privileges
Feb 17 11:38:34 <TMM>	$ operf ls

Feb 17 11:39:13 <pierrot>	has anyone experienced something like this? http://i.imgur.com/s5vAbZ3.png
Feb 17 11:39:25 <pierrot>	it's extremely annoying
Feb 17 11:40:22 <nitind>	It's not really a substitute for words. How did you get to that happening?
Feb 17 11:41:24 <pierrot>	that happens whenever I move the scroll wheel of my mouse
Feb 17 11:42:05 <pierrot>	(And it's the only program that gives me those visualisation problems.)
Feb 17 11:42:18 <rgrunber>	ipun: lufimtse ^ thoughts on that image ?
Feb 17 11:42:43 <pierrot>	if I select and unselect the text, I see it right again
Feb 17 11:42:48 <mbooth>	TMM: Sorry it didn't work out-of-the-box -- we should probably handle that case a bit better
Feb 17 11:43:13 <pierrot>	but it's very annoying to do this thousands of times
Feb 17 11:43:27 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, hey
Feb 17 11:43:30 <ipun>	pierrot: unfortunately not. Seems like a drawing issue. When did this start happening? What distro?
Feb 17 11:44:13 <lufimtse>	rgrunber, ipun is our drawing expert now
Feb 17 11:44:14 <pierrot>	Linux TOSHIBA-Debian-pbz 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.39-1 (2016-12-30) x86_64 GNU/Linux
Feb 17 11:44:15 <TMM>	mbooth, that's ok, thanks! Do you happen to know if the oprofile plugin expects the profile data to be in any particular place?
Feb 17 11:44:23 <TMM>	mbooth, for my program it doesn't sit in the workspace
Feb 17 11:44:38 <pierrot>	ipun: Debian Jessie
Feb 17 11:45:11 <pierrot>	I downloaded Eclipse Neon.2 yesterday from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
Feb 17 11:45:34 <pierrot>	but I tried the eclipse package of Debian and I get the same problem
Feb 17 11:48:08 <ipun>	pierrot: I cant seem to replicate it on my Fedora 25 machine. I may have to refer you to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/ and file one with some details about your machine
Feb 17 11:49:23 <mbooth>	TMM: I'm afraid I don't know the answer to that
Feb 17 11:49:53 <TMM>	oprofile keeps saying there's no profile data :-/
Feb 17 11:50:35 <pierrot>	ipun: I'll do that thanks. but do you have any clue about what could be causing those drawing problems?
Feb 17 11:51:26 <rgrunber>	ipun: Debian Jessie seems to be using gtk 3.14.5 (https://packages.debian.org/source/jessie/gtk+3.0)
Feb 17 11:51:38 <pierrot>	I tried eclipse in different windows managers also (the KDE Window manager, dwm and ratpoison), and in all of them happens the same.
Feb 17 11:52:29 <purplex88>	how to set console encoding to utf8?
Feb 17 11:53:59 <rgrunber>	TMM: i believe it's going to expect you to run the program by clicking on the project and running with oprofile/operf. it should pick up the data on its own.
Feb 17 11:53:59 <ipun>	pierrot: hmm, wierd that its a problem on different window managers. Id recommend updating your GTK libraries and see if that helps
Feb 17 11:56:44 <rgrunber>	ipun: TMM .. this seems to be a known bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=426694
Feb 17 11:57:20 <ipun>	rgrunber: nice good catch
Feb 17 11:58:43 <ipun>	pierrot: I think  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=426694 may give a bit more insight about the issue
Feb 17 12:00:34 <pierrot>	ipun: ohhh yeah, that's exactly my problem
Feb 17 12:01:06 <pierrot>	I'll read all the discussion
Feb 17 12:04:27 <rgrunber>	pierrot: i would try 'LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 eclipse' .. worst case SWT_GTK3=0 will likely work but falling back to gtk2 isn't ideal.
Feb 17 12:15:58 <pierrot>	rgrunber: it didn't work the former but the latter
Feb 17 12:19:28 <pierrot>	And I obviously prefer to use an outdated gui toolkit library than use an updated one with ugly black areas when scrolling :P
Feb 17 12:28:25 <TMM>	mbooth, I can't get any of the profiling tools to work correctly. I get a nullpointer exception if I try gprof, oprofile is not able to locate the profiling data... :-/
Feb 17 12:28:33 <TMM>	mbooth, and yes I built with -pg ;)
Feb 17 12:32:01 <mbooth>	TMM: That's no good. :-( Would you mind filing a bug?
Feb 17 12:32:30 <TMM>	this is going to make the 'make it faster' bugreport harder to fix ;)
Feb 17 12:32:56 <CAP2982>	Hi, I am trying to debug a problem using a Remote Application configuration to run a C++ project. I am using last Eclipse neon (lastest) CDT. Is there a way to enable as much debug as possible, to see what Eclipse is doing behind the scenes when I click 'Run' (or 'Debug')?
Feb 17 12:33:03 <CAP2982>	It gets stuck at 'executing printenv'
Feb 17 12:46:11 <TMM>	mbooth, on the fedora bugtracker?
Feb 17 12:47:43 <mbooth>	TMM: For plugins installed through yum/dnf, yes please :-)
Feb 17 12:50:26 <TMM>	mbooth, I switched to a dnf installed eclipse for everything now
Feb 17 13:15:47 <TMM>	mbooth, it looks like it's crashing trying to find addr2line
Feb 17 13:15:50 <TMM>	org.eclipse.cdt.utils.DefaultGnuToolFactory.getAddr2linePath(DefaultGnuToolFactory.java:99)
Feb 17 15:08:34 <Cehon>	So I'm trying to change the theme.  I installed Eclipse Color Theme 1.0.0, and I'm trying to pick a theme, but it only themes the editor window, not the package explorer, task list, etc.
Feb 17 15:09:22 <Cehon>	Can anyone tell me what I did wrong?  I tried checking and unchecking "Set all background colors to the default" and restarted Eclipse several times.
Feb 17 15:10:08 <Cehon>	I also tried multiple themes: Oblivion, Solarized Dark, and Sublime Text 2.
Feb 17 15:11:21 <Cehon>	(I tried Moonrise UI, but I couldn't stand having package explorer show file names grey on black.)
Feb 17 15:13:33 <Cehon>	Oh, and I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 using Neon.2 (4.6.2)

Mar 06 09:30:14 <lorenzosu>	I have a problem with dark themes and suggested autocomplete: https://snag.gy/y1HBJw.jpg
Mar 06 09:44:30 <mvvvv>	lorenzosu, don't know about windows or dark theme but did you tried this one ? https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/february/article5.php  for oraclejdk
Mar 06 09:49:03 <lorenzosu>	mvvvv: I'm actually using that one :)
Mar 06 09:49:26 <lorenzosu>	I think there's some default windows something going on
Mar 06 09:55:11 <mvvvv>	lorenzosu, in prefs : General/appearance do you have " use mixed fonts and colours for labels" checked ?
Mar 06 09:55:31 <mvvvv>	try to uncheck it
Mar 06 09:57:59 <lorenzosu>	I did that
Mar 06 09:58:04 <lorenzosu>	no success :(
Mar 06 09:58:07 <mvvvv>	there is also : Content Assist back(fore)ground color in Basic (Colors and Fonts)
Mar 06 10:02:45 <nitind>	Any PyDev-specific preferences or categories?
Mar 06 10:14:33 <lorenzosu>	mvvvv: I tried playing with all of those... nitind not sure how could I test that? I think assist is pretty standard?
Mar 06 10:22:13 <mvvvv>	lorenzosu, this is the right preference setting for java autocomple box but not for xsl. Did you tried with an other file type ? java ?
Mar 06 10:27:20 <lorenzosu>	mvvvv: no I haven't

Mar 07 12:33:48 <mistria>	ipun: about https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=513247 , it's not all marketplace URLs, only some ones according to a regexp

Mar 07 12:34:29 <mistria>	http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=3050570
Mar 07 12:34:30 <ipun>	mistria: ah got it. I realized it obviously works everywhere else other than the editor
Mar 07 12:34:57 <mistria>	ipun: yeah, editor capture the drop as text (fair enough)
Mar 07 12:35:17 <mistria>	ipun: and only textual editors, form or diagram ones don't capture it
Mar 07 12:35:37 <mistria>	ipun: it's not really the editor, but the underlying widget
Mar 07 12:36:08 <mistria>	ipun: org.eclipse.epp.internal.mpc.ui.wizards.MarketplaceDropAdapter is the starting point
Mar 07 12:39:27 <ipun>	mistria: sounds good :)
Mar 07 12:43:05 <mistria>	ipun: please be generous in the URLs you support, would be cool to support any clone URL or any web page URL, as opposed to MPC which requires some specific URLs that cannot be web pages
Mar 07 12:43:48 <mistria>	ipun: ie git@github.com:user/repo or https://github.com/user/repo/issue/34 should both be good URLs for import via DND
Mar 07 12:44:26 <mistria>	ipun: actually, once you know it's a GitHub URL, the only thing that matters is "user/repo"
Mar 07 12:44:51 <mistria>	ipun: as IIRC, the GitHub plugin in Eclipse IDE only requires those 2 things to get started

Mar 09 08:26:38 <str>	I've just installed Eclipse 4.6.2. My problem is that the perspective toolbar is not shown. How can I force it to show?
Mar 09 08:27:52 <mbooth>	str: When you right-click in some empty toolbar space, do you see a "restore hidden entries" option?
Mar 09 08:30:24 <str>	mbooth, nothing happens if I right-click anything near the toolbar. This is how it looks: http://storage7.static.itmages.com/i/17/0309/h_1489066171_8207254_d6402ab299.png
Mar 09 08:31:06 <mvvvv>	str, what is your OS ?
Mar 09 08:31:22 <str>	mvvvv, Ubuntu
Mar 09 08:32:49 <mvvvv>	str, I guess this is a GTK3 problem. does it work with : export SWT_GTK3=0 ?
Mar 09 08:33:46 <str>	mvvvv, testing...
Mar 09 08:37:45 <str>	mvvvv, that did it!
Mar 09 09:27:25 <str>	In the project explorer, I was able to "go into" when I double clicked a folder. Now I can't.  How do I switch it back?
Mar 09 09:30:52 <surial>	str: that wasn't the project explorer.
Mar 09 09:31:05 <surial>	str: double clicking folders in the project explorer expands them.
Mar 09 09:35:33 <surial>	str: actually, huh, learned something: That probably WAS the project epxlorer. It's a setting. open preferences, search for 'action on double click', and make it 'go into' instead of the default 'expand'.
Mar 09 09:48:50 <str>	surial, I don't find any "action on double click"
Mar 09 09:49:12 <str>	surial, under what tree entry is it in the preferences window?
Mar 09 09:51:03 <surial>	str: 'java'
Mar 09 09:54:25 <str>	I don't have a "java" root preference setting. I do have that option in my "PHP" preference, but it does not affect how I "go into" a folder.
Mar 09 09:58:27 <str>	:D I've closed the "Project Explorer" and opened the "PHP Explorer" and that did the trick.

Mar 10 05:33:48 <Tobbi>	Hey. I am trying to run an SWTBot test in eclipse. Upon compilation it tells me that org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Tree cannot be resolved. Any idea? Afaik, I got all the deps.
Mar 10 08:00:42 <JuJUBee>	Is it possible to use eclipse to do simple single file c++ programs without creating a project?
Mar 10 08:01:27 <mbooth>	JuJUBee: You can edit files that are not part of any project, but you probably won't be able to run or debug them from within eclipse
Mar 10 08:02:19 <JuJUBee>	That is what I was afraid of
Mar 10 08:02:31 <mbooth>	JuJUBee: But then if all you want is a text editor, I'd recommend something else :-)
Mar 10 08:02:40 <mbooth>	JuJUBee: Why don't you want a project?
Mar 10 08:03:15 <JuJUBee>	I am teaching a group of students introduction to programming.  I usually use text editor and command line linux to compile and run
Mar 10 08:03:26 <JuJUBee>	Just wanted to offer something different
Mar 10 08:03:58 <JuJUBee>	I could use http://cpp.sh I guess
Mar 10 08:05:02 <mbooth>	JuJUBee: So why don't you want a project? A project in Eclipse is pretty much just a folder in your workspace
Mar 10 08:05:41 <JuJUBee>	Just more clutter in the users docs folders that they won't understand just yet
Mar 10 08:06:55 <mbooth>	JuJUBee: You don't even have to know it's there... Because you're using an IDE, no need to look on the filesystem
Mar 10 08:07:26 <JuJUBee>	Have you ever taught high school?
Mar 10 08:08:15 <mbooth>	JuJUBee: No, but IMO filesystem  "clutter" was is not a very solid reason to avoid using an IDE :-)
Mar 10 08:08:44 <JuJUBee>	So we agree to disagree.  Not a problem
Mar 10 08:09:33 <JuJUBee>	This group will not get to a point where a project is required so I want to keep it simple
Mar 10 13:35:13 <shayden>	i'm running neon.2 and i'm trying to open a git project that i cloned into ~/workspace using the "File -> Open Projects from file sytem", and it fails silently...
Mar 10 13:35:54 <shayden>	it was working a little while ago, and i can open the same project from other non-"workspace" directories, plus I can open other projects from the workspace
Mar 10 13:37:47 <shayden>	nothing in the error log reports any problems, the project just doesn't show up in the package explorer...
Mar 10 14:34:25 <meandrain>	hi, any idea  how to fix this?  eclipse c++ make: Nothing to be done for `all'.  when run called

Mar 10 16:51:12 <rzyz>	Hello, in C/C++, when typing the first character of a variable, eclipse doesn't propose to me the end of it, an idea, can't find the setting...?
Mar 11 02:05:18 <dohzer>	Hey, hopefully someone can give me a bit of help.
Mar 11 02:05:19 <dohzer>	I'm having trouble with my startup code. I'm using GCC with Eclipse and it seems to not be able to find "__libc_init_array".
Mar 11 02:05:37 <dohzer>	    init.c:(.text.__libc_init_array+0x38): undefined reference to `_init'
Mar 11 02:05:47 <dohzer>	if I add a blank init() function, it fixes it
Mar 11 02:06:01 <dohzer>	but it isn't complaining about not being able to find SystemInit even though I don't have that code
Mar 11 02:06:20 <dohzer>	Is SystemInit defined somewhere special, but _init() isn't?

Mar 13 10:56:18 <iwan933>	now i can't get any unittests running - maybe falling back to an early version is a good idea?

Mar 13 21:26:29 <dbtid>	hi.  i'm having an issue where eclipse can't find the binary, even though the C/C++ settings tab shows the proper PATH variable.
Mar 13 21:26:43 <dbtid>	is there a way to peek in to what environment Eclipse is going to use for a Build?
Mar 13 21:28:12 <dbtid>	if it matters, i'm using atollic 7.1.1
Mar 13 21:34:30 <dbtid>	using Terminal from inside eclipse shows that the path to the tool is missing.  but it has the project path correct.  what gives?
Mar 14 06:30:13 <mwayne>	Hi is it not possible anymore to replace the splash image of eclipse?
Mar 14 06:45:56 <tuor__>	Hi, I'm comparing 2 files. I would like to only see the editor with the 2 files an hide all other buttons. I just want to use all of my screen space to see the files. (I don't have good eyes and require bigger font size...) (the files have longer lines then 80/100/120 characters.)
Mar 14 06:48:13 <tuor__>	So I want to only see the editor, no buttons around, no other spaces or something.
Mar 14 06:48:40 <tuor__>	Is this possible (with a keyboard shortcut)?
Mar 14 07:03:02 <tuor__>	I found a solution, i moved all the stuff like the project tree view into the top toolbar, then window -> appearance -> hide toolbar. Last maximize the editor. Like this moste of the space is used for my editor. I I like remember this layout and bind it to a keyboard shortcut?
Mar 14 10:50:01 <mbooth_>	tuor__: http://blog.vogella.com/2015/10/09/eclipse-neon-and-saneclipse-adding-full-screen-mode-for-eclipse/
Mar 14 11:02:49 <tuor__>	mbooth_, thx. I have only to figure out why the ctrl+alt+m doesn't work, but ctrl++ / ctrl+- works fine.
Mar 14 11:29:45 <tuor__>	The fontsize feature is working, but the "fullscreen"/"maximized" feature isn't working for me.
Mar 14 11:29:54 <tuor__>	current version of eclipse and the plugin.
Mar 14 14:02:12 <loganrun>	why does printing not work correctly on eclipse. it gives this super huge font ever since I can remember.
Mar 14 14:02:47 <loganrun>	seems like it would be trivial to fix
Mar 14 14:54:57 <glysbaysb>	I'm running Eclipse Neon on Win7 and trying to debug using a QEMU on linux. As the GDB backend tries to load the exectuable it changes the path to where that executable is supposed to be -- but obviously that folder does not exist (and isn't even a valid folder) on the other machine: http://pastebin.com/SAMwgcgr
Mar 14 14:55:40 <glysbaysb>	Is there a way to solve that, maybe an option in eclipse that disables the normal commands that will be send where I could subsitute my own?
Mar 15 05:57:52 <Tobbi>	Does anyone here know how to create a run configuration for SWTBot and an external program?
Mar 15 06:01:53 <mvvvv>	Tobbi, http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/SWTBot/article.html#adjust-launch-configuration
Mar 15 06:02:17 <Tobbi>	mvvvv: The thing is: my product is not listed there.
Mar 15 06:02:52 <Tobbi>	hmm, wait a minute.
Mar 15 06:03:39 <Tobbi>	Yeah, that's the thing.
Mar 15 09:27:14 <barq>	I can't get updates in Eclipse neon.2 on fedora. I've tried both system wide proxies and eclipse proxies, no luck. What can I do to get this to work?
Mar 15 09:42:36 <Tobbi>	Hey. How can I find the location of an Eclipse "product"?
Mar 15 09:44:23 <mvvvv>	Tobbi, where you created it : https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_What_is_an_Eclipse_product%3F
Mar 15 09:44:37 <Tobbi>	I seem to be a noob :D
Mar 15 09:45:41 <Tobbi>	mvvvv:  The thing is: We build our product using Ant tasks usually. For some reason, when using the Run button, the product we use launches but can't login.
Mar 15 09:46:08 <Tobbi>	That's the general thing...And SWTbot requires a launch configuration, not an ant task :D

Mar 15 10:26:58 <mvvvv>	glysbaysb, is it this folder ? : in the Eclipse menu, go to (Window →) Preferences → Run/Debug → QEMU
Mar 15 10:36:58 <glysbaysb>	mvvvv yes that's the one.
Mar 15 12:08:56 <egituser>	Hi, when I commit using egit it defaults to  100644. how can I change it to 100777 by default (I understand it only retains the execute permission - this is fine). Additional if I do git update-index --chmod=+x when I commit this change, it picks up the fact it's changed in staging but when I commit this it fails with an error (think this is a bug).
Mar 15 12:10:35 <Kahenraz>	Hello!

Mar 16 02:30:39 <adenon82>	I would want to improve the eclipse load in my laptop.
Mar 16 02:33:27 <adenon82>	Ive read on inet some procedures, like using ramdisk, squashfs, scripts to rsync the workspace.. but they work not fully well.
Mar 16 02:35:55 <adenon82>	Could somebody help me? I can show the links with that information
Mar 16 03:41:04 <necku>	I have downloaded a jar-file from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuarmeclipse/files/Eclipse/updates-test/plugins/ . But, when I go Help->Install New Software->Add->Archive in Eclipse Neon.1a he sais that he can't find the file, although the path is correct. Th epath contains no white spaces. Why does this happen, and how can I install the package otherwise?
Mar 16 06:50:53 <Tobbi>	Hello again. It's me. I've been wondering about executing tests using the command line. My tests apparently never execute for some reason.
Mar 16 06:50:59 <Tobbi>	If anyone could help me that would be great.
Mar 16 06:51:21 <Tobbi>	I'm using swtbot for that matter.
Mar 16 06:51:27 <Tobbi>	Plugins are included in my product.
Mar 16 06:51:37 <Tobbi>	And can even be resolved...
Mar 16 06:54:42 <mbooth_>	Tobbi: Using tycho?
Mar 16 06:55:44 <Tobbi>	mbooth_: Uhm, not really? I manually copied everything.
Mar 16 06:56:51 <mbooth_>	Tobbi: Okay. I ask because I could probably help if you were building and running your tests from command line using tycho (the standard build system for eclipse plugins)
Mar 16 06:57:01 <Tobbi>	hmm...
Mar 16 06:57:08 <Tobbi>	I can probably change that.
Mar 16 06:57:46 <Tobbi>	Or maybe not. Seems complicated.
Mar 16 06:58:40 <mbooth_>	Tycho is just extensions to maven, so if you are familiar with standard maven, it's not that difficult to figure out
Mar 16 06:59:34 <Tobbi>	I am not, actually.
Mar 16 07:07:21 <Tobbi>	We compile our code using Ant tasks.
Mar 16 07:08:16 <Tobbi>	http://pastebin.com/dJvNwBAq that's the command I am using.
Mar 16 09:14:07 <tuor__>	Hi, I'm editing some python qweb. Is there a plugin to get correct syntax highlight? At the moment I'm using the HTML editor. The HTML-code is fine, only the qweb specific parts are completly blue.
Mar 16 09:15:33 <tuor__>	http://pastebin.com/G3abKwx8
Mar 16 09:15:47 <tuor__>	This is an code example.
Mar 16 09:19:16 <mvvvv>	tuor__, did you tried with xml editor and the corresponding schemas ?
Mar 16 09:19:37 <tuor__>	schemas?
Mar 16 09:19:52 <mvvvv>	xsd files
Mar 16 09:20:18 <tuor__>	mvvvv, sorry I don't know what an xsd file is. (I'm pretty new to eclipse...)
Mar 16 09:20:59 <mbooth_>	tuor__: It's an XML thing, not an Eclipse thing :-)
Mar 16 09:21:19 <mvvvv>	the file you pasted is an xml file (not an html file)
Mar 16 09:21:33 <tuor__>	Yes,...
Mar 16 09:21:44 <tuor__>	But it has some html like stuff in in.
Mar 16 09:22:01 <tuor__>	How should I read/write this file?
Mar 16 09:22:37 <mvvvv>	a schema xsd file is also a xml file indicating the rules of the language you are using . and yes this language seem to use xhtml tags
Mar 16 09:25:20 <mbooth_>	tuor__: You are writing XML, so you should use XML editor. XSD (XML Schema Definition?) files are used to validate XML, so usually you'd indicate to the editor where the XSD is so it can correctly validate your XML
Mar 16 09:28:11 <tuor__>	mbooth_, mvvvv ah ok. So I don't have a such xsd file, but maybe i can find one for my language.
Mar 16 09:28:23 <mvvvv>	yes
Mar 16 09:28:37 <mvvvv>	but I don't know where ... google is not helpfull
Mar 16 09:30:53 <Tobbi>	We got our tests working with ecptt now :_
Mar 16 09:30:55 <Tobbi>	:)
Mar 16 09:31:19 <Tobbi>	Just one small thing: We have a custom control (I think) that's not getting detected with rcptt.
Mar 16 09:58:03 <ademon82>	<adenon82> I would want to improve the eclipse load in my laptop. [07:33:26] <adenon82> Ive read on inet some procedures, like using ramdisk, squashfs, scripts to rsync the workspace.. but they work not fully well. [07:35:54] <adenon82> Could somebody help me? I can show the links with that information
Mar 16 09:59:04 <mbooth_>	ademon82: It's not obvious to me what problem you are trying to solve...
Mar 16 10:00:34 <mvvvv>	ademon82, what is your OS ?
Mar 16 10:13:05 <Tobbi>	How can one extend rcptt to be able to detect custom controls?
Mar 16 10:18:41 <dbtid>	hello.  i'm running into an issue where eclipse says it can't find the compiler, even though the path to the compiler is in the C/C++ build settings Environment Variables.
Mar 16 10:18:49 <dbtid>	can someone offer some ideas?
Mar 16 10:22:49 <dbtid>	i'd been running ver x.y.0 of the vendor's release, and all was well.  went to x.y.1 (didn't uninstall x.y.0 first), but when i ran x.y.1 i ran into this issue.  even after multiple uninstalls and single re-installs (x.y.0 first, then x.y.1) i still have this problem.
Mar 16 10:23:02 <dbtid>	it's like eclipse is leaving data around in a directory somewhere and it's confused.
Mar 16 10:45:03 <Tobbi>	Is there a customization guide for rcptt anywhere?
Mar 16 10:46:21 <nogger>	hi all, while i try to compile today's exercise for my c class i got theese 2 errors i cant' get around:

Mar 16 11:08:41 <ademon82>	mbooth_ , sorry
Mar 16 11:10:33 <mbooth_>	ademon82: I see, you didn't tell us how it fails or even what problem you are trying to use a ramdrive to solve
Mar 16 11:11:07 <ademon82>	ok, iam trying to speed up eclipse in ubuntu
Mar 16 11:11:21 <ademon82>	and debian
Mar 16 11:12:34 <mbooth_>	That's still pretty vague ;-) What exactly is slow? What else did you try first? Did you try giving Eclipse more memory, for example? That can help with large workspaces
Mar 16 11:13:37 <ademon82>	http://www.normation.com/en/blog/2010/07/27/set-up-eclipse-workspace-in-ram/
Mar 16 11:14:31 <ademon82>	well Ive double the ram, from 4 to 8gb
Mar 16 11:15:28 <ademon82>	slow, like smoothy
Mar 16 11:16:07 <ademon82>	i cant use it in windows, so ive installed debian, what make things better, but..
Mar 16 11:16:36 <ademon82>	how can i give Eclipse more memory? changing eclipse.ini file?
Mar 16 11:17:03 <mbooth_>	ademon82: https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_increase_the_heap_size_available_to_Eclipse%3F
Mar 16 11:21:00 <ademon82>	ok, this is mine
Mar 16 11:21:00 <ademon82>	http://pastebin.com/65ebDF69
Mar 16 11:21:38 <ademon82>	do you think it's is well configurated?
Mar 16 11:23:40 <mbooth_>	ademon82: Looks like you gave it 4gb, not 8gb
Mar 16 11:24:02 <ademon82>	yes, the half of total ram
Mar 16 11:24:43 <ademon82>	do you think I can rise to 8G?
Mar 16 11:25:13 <mbooth_>	ademon82: But we can't really tell you how to speed it up if you won't tell us what is slow ;-)
Mar 16 11:25:27 <ademon82>	all right
Mar 16 11:25:33 <ademon82>	how I tell you?
Mar 16 11:25:51 <ademon82>	is there a command that can mesure that?
Mar 16 11:26:13 <ademon82>	ok
Mar 16 11:26:37 <ademon82>	i work with tomcat8
Mar 16 11:27:21 <ademon82>	sometimes it spend almost 30seconds in loading
Mar 16 11:27:57 <ademon82>	well the laptop is not a lamborgini but, in my classroom, I can loadit at 2 sec or so
Mar 16 11:28:19 <ademon82>	im using mars.2
Mar 16 11:28:39 <ademon82>	is there any log, that i could wrap you'
Mar 16 11:28:42 <ademon82>	?
Mar 16 11:31:34 <mbooth_>	ademon82: Well, if it is just startup that is slow, putting your workspace on a ramdisk will not help you (this is why you need to tell us what problem you are trying to solve)
Mar 16 11:32:06 <mbooth_>	ademon82: Also Mars is quite old now, have you tried latest version of Eclipse?
Mar 16 11:32:19 <ademon82>	yes
Mar 16 11:32:29 <ademon82>	neon is not an opcion
Mar 16 11:32:34 <ademon82>	is more slower :(
Mar 16 11:32:39 <nitind>	If Tomcat is taking time to start, where is Tomcat? Is the workspace already on a local disk?
Mar 16 11:32:45 <ademon82>	i mean,
Mar 16 11:32:55 <ademon82>	if mars 30 sec, neon 60
Mar 16 11:33:18 <ademon82>	nitind tomcat is in /opt/tomcat8
Mar 16 11:33:23 <ademon82>	and yes
Mar 16 11:34:02 <nitind>	Is /opt?
Mar 16 11:34:40 <nitind>	~info
Mar 16 11:34:41 <Arbalest>	Please state a) your Eclipse version, and b) where you got Eclipse from (eclipse.org, Linux distro repository, etc.). If from eclipse.org, the actual filename. c) your CPU architecture (x86, 64-bit, etc.), d) operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.), e) your Java Runtime Environment (please verify by checking your ~logs or in the about dialog's ~jre section. Typing 'java -version' in the command line does not count as checking).

Mar 16 11:53:30 <nitind>	Try an Oracle JRE instead of an OpenJDK one.
Mar 16 11:54:26 <nitind>	Actually, I can't tell which one that's supposed to be.
Mar 16 11:56:01 <ademon82>	thanks nitind, I will change that
Mar 16 11:56:27 <nitind>	Also, try using a Tomcat tarball from Apache instead of the installed copy of Tomcat.
Mar 16 11:57:03 <ademon82>	hy mvvvv, before you asked me my so: Linux debian 4.9.0-2-amd64
Mar 16 11:57:03 <nitind>	Is the Mars limitation because of the JBoss Tools?
Mar 16 11:57:52 <ademon82>	sorry, i dont know about that limitation..
Mar 16 11:58:38 <mvvvv>	ademon82, are you launching eclipse with swt-gtk3  or gtk2 ?
Mar 16 11:58:59 <ademon82>	https://paste.ee/d/HnQTs mvvvv, gtk2 I think...
Mar 16 11:59:31 <ademon82>	with gtk3 i cant use it in my xfce well
Mar 16 12:00:34 <mbooth_>	ademon82: Do you need jbosstools, datatools, etc that you have installed? Eclipse may function faster with fewer plugins installed
Mar 16 12:01:05 <ademon82>	well, I just need hibernate
Mar 16 12:01:20 <ademon82>	and tomcat8
Mar 16 12:02:40 <mvvvv>	ademon82, you launch eclipse with gtk3 : Id: org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_64, Version: 3.104.2.v20160212-1350, Location:

Mar 20 12:58:53 <red-001>	how do I stop the SWTError: No more handles crash?
Mar 20 12:59:49 <red-001>	I always get that crash within a few minutes of starting eclipse
Mar 20 13:00:13 <mbooth_>	red-001: What platform?
Mar 20 13:01:53 <red-001>	arch linux
Mar 20 13:03:01 <red-001>	I installed it using the package manager
Mar 20 13:11:01 <red-001>	can someone send me a link to the windows build of eclipse?
Mar 20 13:11:10 <red-001>	I want to try and run it under wine
Mar 20 13:11:27 <red-001>	but the website is only showing me linux builds
Mar 20 13:12:48 <red-001>	nvm
Mar 20 13:16:51 <mbooth_>	red-001: Using gtk3 and/or wayland? You could try switching to gtk2 or switching to x11 to see if the issue goes away
Mar 20 13:51:19 <red-001>	I tried swithing to gnome classic and it seems to have stopped happening
Mar 20 13:51:28 <red-001>	or I'm just lucky
Mar 20 14:34:43 <red-001>	yeah looks like that fixed it
Mar 20 14:34:46 <red-001>	ty
Mar 20 19:45:30 <rjcarr>	I’m on neon.2 and macos sierra.  I followed this guide to install subversive: https://eclipse.org/subversive/installation-instructions.php.  I’ve had subversion integration before but it seems to get borked every time I update eclipse.  Anyway, I followed everything there, everything seems fine, but when I do something simple like add a package it doesn’t appear subversion is notified.
Mar 20 19:45:55 <rjcarr>	That is, if I do a “svn status” it puts a ? next to the new package instead of an A.  What am I missing?
Mar 21 01:12:39 <loganlee>	is eclipse website down?
Mar 21 01:14:29 <loganlee>	is eclipse website down?
Mar 21 01:47:17 <loganlee>	ferdna, is eclipse website down?
Mar 21 09:12:04 <fergal>	hi guys is there a way to list a tree of all the methods that a certain method will call, and all the methods they call etc?
Mar 21 09:22:14 <Stummi>	fergal, call hierachy
Mar 21 09:22:39 <Stummi>	fergal, ctrl+alt+h when the method is focused
Mar 21 09:23:04 <Stummi>	and then switch from "show caller hierachy" to "show callee hierachy"
Mar 21 09:37:28 <fergal>	Stummi: ahhhhhh
Mar 21 09:37:31 <fergal>	thanks man
Mar 21 09:51:25 <fergal>	Stummi: sorry to bother you again, but is there a way to search for specific keywords in a given callee hierarchy? so i want to find anywhere an object is being created in the hierarchy (it’s a game loop and i’m trying to replace calls to new with object modifications instead)
Mar 21 09:52:11 <Stummi>	no idea
Mar 21 10:00:49 <nogger>	hi all, i'm having problems compiling my project for my c class, i've tried to solve since last monday, i'm writing the code on an online service but my class requires using eclipse
Mar 21 10:01:49 <mbooth_>	fergal: Make the constructor private and see where errors appear ;-)
Mar 21 10:02:28 <nogger>	http://imgur.com/a/JoOFh
Mar 21 10:03:01 <nogger>	that's the error i get, it doesnt point to a line in my program
Mar 21 10:03:46 <nogger>	i searched for error 127 but i found no solutions
Mar 21 10:04:47 <nogger>	i use an ubuntu based distribution
Mar 21 10:05:31 <nogger>	i get the both while error using linux gcc and cross gcc,
Mar 21 10:05:45 <nogger>	i get the error both while using linux gcc and cross gcc,
Mar 21 10:06:51 <mbooth_>	nogger: Error 127 from make usually means "file not found" so, simplest thing first: Are you sure you have all the necessary tools installed?
Mar 21 10:07:05 <nogger>	gcc --version gives me this output gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4) 5.4.0 20160609
Mar 21 10:07:28 <nogger>	I compiled other programs with success
Mar 21 10:08:02 <nogger>	for example i can compile a bmi calculator, an hello world without receiving errors
Mar 21 10:09:10 <mbooth_>	nogger: And can you compile this project successfully from command line also?
Mar 21 10:09:28 <nogger>	mmh not sure
Mar 21 10:09:35 <nogger>	i did this
Mar 21 10:09:54 <nogger>	gcc -c test2.c -o test2.o
Mar 21 10:10:39 <nogger>	and i get no output
Mar 21 10:10:54 <nogger>	while test2.o gets generated
Mar 21 10:11:07 <mbooth_>	Not with make file?
Mar 21 10:11:37 <nogger>	what should i type in?
Mar 21 10:11:53 <mbooth_>	In your screenshot you are using make (or eclipse is trying to invoke make to build your project)
Mar 21 10:12:23 <mbooth_>	So in your project directory, run "make"
Mar 21 10:12:29 <mbooth_>	Do you get same error?
Mar 21 10:13:27 <nogger>	i have to target the .c?
Mar 21 10:13:54 <mbooth_>	nogger: just "make"
Mar 21 10:14:10 <mbooth_>	What is the output?
Mar 21 10:15:09 <nogger>	make: *** Nessun obiettivo specificato e nessun makefile trovato.  Arresto. no objective no makefile found, but i think i misunderstood what i should have done
Mar 21 10:16:28 <mbooth_>	nogger: So there is no makefile? If you are not using make, then you shouldn't use make in Eclipse ;-)
Mar 21 10:17:20 <nogger>	why does eclipse compile other projects without this error then?
Mar 21 10:17:40 <nogger>	i'm not doing any different
Mar 21 10:19:09 <mbooth_>	nogger: I don't know because I can't see your other projects...
Mar 21 10:19:18 <mbooth_>	Do you have a makefile in those projects?
Mar 21 10:20:10 <nogger>	ok i misunderstood
Mar 21 10:20:26 <nogger>	i have found the makefile on the faulty project
Mar 21 10:20:57 <nogger>	gives me the output "make: "src/002 esercizio lab array&matrici.o" è aggiornato." the .o is updated
Mar 21 10:23:58 <nogger>	i might have solved
Mar 21 10:25:10 <nogger>	i made another and named it without spaces because using the terminal reminded me how unwieldy spaces are to use
Mar 21 10:25:24 <nogger>	and it compiles
Mar 21 10:26:10 <nogger>	but i have other projects with spaces in the name
Mar 21 10:26:15 <nogger>	may it be the &?
Mar 21 10:27:16 <mbooth_>	possibly... "&" has special meaning in shell script, so maybe there is some escaping missing
Mar 21 10:27:24 <nogger>	ok, i can't compile an hello world with an &
Mar 21 10:27:33 <nogger>	thanks
Mar 21 10:27:47 <nogger>	I like using eclipse
Mar 21 10:28:32 <nogger>	and it's required in future years of my course
Mar 21 15:31:19 <glysbaysb>	I'm running Eclipse Neon on Win7 and trying to debug using a QEMU on linux. As the GDB backend tries to load the exectuable it changes the path to where that executable is supposed to be -- but obviously that folder does not exist (and isn't even a valid folder) on the other machine: http://pastebin.com/SAMwgcgr
Mar 21 15:31:19 <glysbaysb>	Is there a way to solve that? I tried to replicate it at home and there it worked fine
Mar 22 05:01:36 <Pymous>	Hey ! Can this channel be used for support about Che ? :3

Mar 22 08:51:43 <Critias>	can I use ant to build a gfortran project?
Mar 22 09:09:11 <Orbixx>	I don't seem to be able to clone this Git repo hosted at Eclipse: https://git.eclipse.org/c/hudson/org.eclipse.hudson.remoting.git/
Mar 22 09:09:16 <Orbixx>	Anybody else experiencing the same?
Mar 22 09:10:54 <mbooth_>	Orbixx: "git clone https://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/hudson/org.eclipse.hudson.remoting.git" works for me, what command did you try?
Mar 22 09:12:45 <Orbixx>	Ah, I was missing ".git" off at the end, didn't spot it, thanks mbooth_

Mar 22 10:13:07 <glysbaysb>	Is there a way to solve that? Maybe an option to disable those normal start commands?
Mar 22 10:13:07 <glysbaysb>	The problem is that I tried to replicate it at home and there it worked fine
