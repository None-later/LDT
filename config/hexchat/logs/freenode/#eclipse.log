Jul 26 05:47:29 <CustosL1men>	O
Jul 26 05:58:02 <mistria>	CustosL1men: do you know how to build this project without Eclipse?
Jul 26 06:11:05 <CustosL1men>	mistria, I guess I can hack something out with javac
Jul 26 06:12:34 <CustosL1men>	let me get a file tree
Jul 26 06:12:43 <mistria>	CustosL1men: Eclipse builds automatically, All you have to do is to set the right classpath
Jul 26 06:13:14 <CustosL1men>	mistria, where is the output of build ?
Jul 26 06:13:35 <mistria>	CustosL1men: classes are usually in the bin/ folder
Jul 26 06:14:20 <mistria>	CustosL1men: if you want the jar, you have to use File > Export > Jar File
Jul 26 06:15:25 <CustosL1men>	http://termbin.com/n2zc
Jul 26 06:19:42 <mistria>	CustosL1men: ok, and what are you trying to achieve exactly?
Jul 26 06:19:57 <CustosL1men>	mistria, I want to build jar
Jul 26 06:20:02 <CustosL1men>	mistria, but what you suggested did wokr
Jul 26 06:20:04 <CustosL1men>	mistria, but what you suggested did work
Jul 26 06:20:11 <CustosL1men>	export jar
Jul 26 06:49:32 <samuel_m>	mistria: thanks for the hint about reporting a bug yesterday, just did that: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=498487
Jul 26 08:39:25 <BadApe>	what is eclipse neon? is it just a new naming scheme?
Jul 26 08:47:37 <CustosL1men>	BadApe, neon is the version/release name
Jul 26 08:50:19 <BadApe>	no more releases like pluto, i guess maybe they ran out of names
Jul 26 09:28:27 <raddy>	Hello Everybody
Jul 26 09:28:41 <raddy>	This is not directly related to eclipse
Jul 26 09:29:02 <raddy>	But people who have experience in Java can try to help

Jul 26 11:45:43 <CustosL1men>	can I do non graphical install for eclipse ?
Jul 26 11:47:27 <mistria>	CustosL1men: Depends on what you want to do, Eclipse can be extended to load without UI, but it's not part of the default packages
Jul 26 11:48:01 <CustosL1men>	actually - I want to build eclipse stuff from command line
Jul 26 11:48:06 <strykerawb>	mistria,  PM
Jul 26 11:48:13 <CustosL1men>	so I downloaded eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz (neon version)
Jul 26 11:48:35 <CustosL1men>	but when I run ./eclipse-installer/eclipse-inst I get graphical installer
Jul 26 11:48:40 <CustosL1men>	I want non graphical installer
Jul 26 11:48:48 <CustosL1men>	or if I can have non installer based eclipse it will also be fine
Jul 26 11:50:24 <mistria>	CustosL1men: ok, those are packages. From http://eclipse.org/downloads, there's a small link behind the installer
Jul 26 11:50:35 <CustosL1men>	ok thanks
Jul 26 11:50:40 <mistria>	CustosL1men: you can directly download zip/tars
Jul 26 11:50:41 <CustosL1men>	let me give it a go
Jul 26 11:51:17 <mistria>	CustosL1men: if you're on a recent and developer friendly Linux distro such as Fedora, there a native packages available with dnf
Jul 26 11:51:21 <mistria>	or apt
Jul 26 11:51:26 <CustosL1men>	mistria, on gentoo
Jul 26 11:51:34 <CustosL1men>	mistria, there are native packages but I dont like them
Jul 26 11:51:49 <mistria>	CustosL1men: don't think there's something recent on Gentoo
Jul 26 12:12:57 <CustosL1men>	so this builds classes hnb eclipse-neon eclipse -nosplash -data "${HOME}/eclipse-workspace/" -application org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core.aptBuild
Jul 26 12:13:04 <CustosL1men>	but not sure how to get it to build jar
Jul 26 12:18:22 <mistria>	CustosL1men: you can try the antBuilder application, and pass an Ant build.xml file
Jul 26 12:20:35 <CustosL1men>	cant I somehow get maven to build eclipse projects ?
Jul 26 12:26:38 <mistria>	CustosL1men: what do you ,mean bu Eclipse projects? Eclipse plugins? or regular Java projects?
Jul 26 12:28:00 <CustosL1men>	mistria, regular java projects like this: http://termbin.com/wbut
Jul 26 12:29:28 <mistria>	CustosL1men: ok, so yes, they can be built with Maven. But this task is independent from the IDE. The IDE can help and will understand Maven, but once your project is Maven based, you simply build it with Maven, no need for the IDE to build.
Jul 26 12:30:15 <CustosL1men>	mistria, see - I just want a simple straight forward way to generate jars for like 20 projects like this from command line
Jul 26 12:30:37 <CustosL1men>	normally I use maven as base - but people who made these projects did not
Jul 26 12:30:53 <CustosL1men>	and I'm trying to figure out how to get this to build automatically for me to jars
Jul 26 12:33:18 <mistria>	CustosL1men: the best way is to migrate this project to Maven. You can automate Eclipse export with Ant, but it's a PITA to maintain such approach
Jul 26 12:34:58 <CustosL1men>	ok - let me see about adding pom.xml files
Jul 26 12:35:29 <CustosL1men>	thanks for help mistria - really means allot ;)
Jul 26 12:35:45 <CustosL1men>	I normally just use vim + maven
Jul 26 12:35:58 <CustosL1men>	so I'm a bit overwhelmed by this IDE stuff
Jul 26 12:46:27 <mistria>	CustosL1men: there's for sure a learning curve, but it's wrth iy
Jul 26 12:46:36 <mistria>	worth it
Jul 26 12:46:58 <dan>	Hi, I just wanted to know, howcome Eclipse does not support JavaFX by default? Is JavaFX considered "dead"?
Jul 26 12:47:00 <CustosL1men>	mistria, for me not really - vim > - but anyway - main challenge is to just get this stuff auto building from command line
Jul 26 12:49:23 <mistria>	CustosL1men: vim is for sure an awesome editor. But automated build, awesome completion, debug, instant error reporting... Even if typimg cam be slower, all the other tools make coding good things easier
Jul 26 12:49:49 <CustosL1men>	mistria, but IMO automated build just inside maven is not usefull
Jul 26 12:50:06 <CustosL1men>	instant error reporting is nice, and auto completion is nice - but not that nice that I ever miss it
Jul 26 12:50:18 <CustosL1men>	<CustosL1men> mistria, but IMO automated build just inside maven is not usefull < I mean just inside eclipse
Jul 26 12:50:39 <CustosL1men>	like I said normally I juse maven - and then for people who want to use eclipse its no problem - but other way round is serious issue IMO
Jul 26 12:50:57 <CustosL1men>	if I cant build something easily from command line its a failure
Jul 26 12:52:29 <mistria>	CustomL1men: I agree about build shouldn't require IDE
Jul 26 12:53:06 <mistria>	CustomL1men: however, the last versions of Maven support in Eclipse IDE sometimes have pretty good completion. Infering parameters and documentation.
Jul 26 13:48:06 <BadApe_>	hello, i see neon has gulp support
Jul 26 13:48:22 <BadApe_>	do i need to install something?
Jul 26 15:03:04 <cjoseph>	hi, I'm using eclipse mars on an HTML page and I see a little warning triangle in the editor next to an iframe tag...but there are no error/problems listed in the problem window
Jul 26 15:03:20 <cjoseph>	any ideas why this is happening?
Jul 26 15:46:08 <nitind>	cjoseph: Have you not yet saved it to disk and let the project build (assuming the validation builder is set on that project)?
Jul 26 15:47:09 <cjoseph>	@nitind: is saved to disk...I have never run build, as it's just static HTML
Jul 26 16:03:47 <nitind>	cjoseph: You can righ-click on the file and Validate from there...I think.
Jul 26 16:04:04 <nitind>	Otherwise it's not going to add anything to the Problems View.
Jul 26 16:08:54 <cjoseph>	oh, that did it
Jul 26 16:08:57 <cjoseph>	thanks

Jul 27 16:13:07 <Vauff>	hi, i'm having an issue with eclipse where the code detail hover window is black and cannot be read, this started happening on a new neon install on linux with an imported workspace from windows mars https://i.imgur.com/bcwHwWS.png
Jul 27 16:15:27 <jeen>	Vauff, that's a known problem with Eclipse on Linux, I've seen it happen as far back as Helios. Fix is to install gnome-color-chooser and there configure background/foreground colors for tooltips.
Jul 27 16:16:03 <jeen>	see http://askubuntu.com/questions/45001/how-to-fix-black-tooltips-in-eclipse
Jul 27 16:18:03 <Vauff>	do you know if that would work with cinnamon?
Jul 27 17:26:37 <Vauff>	jeen: i've got it up and running now, however it seems that eclipse doesn't listen to anything i do with the background colour, the foreground does change properly though
Jul 27 18:39:35 <chealer>	hi. When debugging, when a variable is selected in the Variables view and its value changes, it does not highlight in yellow (since it's highlighted as selected). is this a known issue?
Jul 27 22:38:15 <_44trent>	so i have some code, but it's all commented out by line...how do I uncomment them all
Jul 27 22:38:36 <_44trent>	i'm trying to use find and replace to get rid of it, btw
Jul 27 22:39:57 <_44trent>	i got rid of the comments that didn't have the line number in them but for example on line 233...it's like this at the start "/* 233 */"
Jul 27 22:40:11 <_44trent>	is there a way i could make it remove everything starting with /* and ending with /*?
Jul 27 22:45:17 <_44trent>	uhm, is anyone here?
Jul 27 22:49:07 <_44trent>	*tumbleweed*
Jul 27 22:55:33 <_44trent>	just highlighting the lines and doing control + shift + \ keeps the whitespaces and the numbers
Jul 27 22:56:23 <phroa>	the comments start and end on the same line, always?
Jul 27 23:04:19 <_44trent>	yeah
Jul 27 23:04:46 <phroa>	they are the only thing on a given line?
Jul 27 23:04:59 <_44trent>	well each line has the comment, and then the code

Jul 27 23:06:49 <phroa>	have you thought about telling jd-gui to not generate those
Jul 27 23:06:59 <_44trent>	uhm, no.
Jul 27 23:07:05 <_44trent>	that's a thing?
Jul 27 23:07:23 <phroa>	that's such an intrusive feature I have to assume you can turn it off
Jul 27 23:08:06 <_44trent>	yeah someone else had already messed with a little, they have a server that is still running alpha and he had to make a new authentication server...
Jul 27 23:08:19 <_44trent>	and they disabled the part that makes it download the game
Jul 27 23:11:05 <_44trent>	i mean, I could get the uncommented code from the unmodified launcher actually
Jul 27 23:11:09 *	_44trent facepalms
Jul 27 23:12:51 <_44trent>	yep the code is untouched except for those things, I did a diff check first
Jul 27 23:13:01 <_44trent>	should be able to just copy it back in
Jul 27 23:19:30 <_44trent>	weird, those comment things are happening with everything...
Jul 27 23:19:36 <_44trent>	is eclipse doing something?
Jul 28 00:46:33 <khlorghaal>	cdt doesnt appear to be passing any of my -l args http://hastebin.com/zawelinijo.tex i know the project settings are correct, but its not showing -lSDL2 anywhere in the output
Jul 28 00:49:56 <khlorghaal>	even if i manually put it in linker misc args it doesnt show up
Jul 28 05:50:09 <StephenS>	hey is it possible to have Insert Dependency in pom.xml when I do alt+space?
Jul 28 07:31:44 <rann>	Hi all, running Eclipse Neon since three days. Have an annoying bug that appears when trying to alter workingsets in Enterprise Explorer and/or Project Explorer. I get an error dialog that tells me that a certain icon in an obj16/ directory could not be found.
Jul 28 07:32:59 <rann>	This seems innocent enough, but two times already, after this error and after closing the IDE, Enterprise Explorer crashed due to workingsets.xml being in an invalid state (two workingsets with the same name it says and creates a modern art of ui elements in Enterprise Explorer)
Jul 28 08:03:34 <pandaadb>	Hi - I have set up a gradle project for scala. It builds fine and i can import it into eclipse, however every time I change anything the editor tells me evertthing is broken
Jul 28 08:56:36 <chealer>	my issue is already tracked in ticket #246733.
Jul 28 08:58:42 <chealer>	if someone has the necessary privilege, this should not be assigned to CDT.
Jul 28 11:52:21 <nitind>	rann: You should report which icon cant be found through ~bugzilla
Jul 28 11:52:21 <Arbalest>	Bugzilla is the bug tracking system used by Eclipse. Open new bug reports and/or enhancement requests https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi / Search for existing bugs and/or enhancement requests https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/query.cgi
Jul 28 11:56:12 <rann>	nitind: alrighty, will do
Jul 28 11:58:34 <rann>	nitind: This one is getting the same backtrace (new, unconfirmed: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=488618)
Jul 28 11:59:38 <rann>	And this one: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=465456
Jul 28 12:03:11 <rann>	heh, how appropriate: "This is a timebomb that shouldn't be left ticking without a target milestone."
Jul 28 15:33:41 <_44trent>	so i'm trying to modify an older minecraft launcher but I can't seem to start it with any run configuration
Jul 28 15:34:12 <_44trent>	iirc the main class is LauncherFrame...in net.minecraft.LauncherFrame...
Jul 28 15:34:20 <_44trent>	but it still won't start
Jul 28 15:35:47 <_44trent>	does anyone know how the heck I can launch it?
Jul 28 15:36:01 <nitind>	WHat have you already tried?
Jul 28 15:36:32 <_44trent>	well, I opened the run configurations and made a run configuration with it's main method being "net.minecraft.LauncherFrame"
Jul 28 15:36:34 <_44trent>	but it can't find that
Jul 28 15:36:55 <_44trent>	i try to do it from the parent directory as the launcher also needs LZMA stuff...
Jul 28 15:37:40 <_44trent>	manifest.mf in meta-inf does say the main class is "net.minecraft.LauncherFrame"
Jul 28 15:38:08 <_44trent>	http://hastebin.com/poyunarero.pas
Jul 28 15:38:12 <_44trent>	that's the manifest
Jul 28 15:38:30 <_44trent>	i don't see why it won't run at all, it doesn't find any methods at all, only the system ones
Jul 28 15:39:32 <_44trent>	do i need to set launcherframe.java as my main class or something?
Jul 28 15:40:03 <_44trent>	this is the directory structure of my project btw: https://vgy.me/s2WMTH
Jul 28 15:43:06 <_44trent>	i should have set that as my source folder probably

Jul 29 03:36:04 <Stummi>	Is there some way to hide warnings from generated source files?
Jul 29 05:41:15 <rann>	Stummi: Apparently this is a feature in the JDT plugin (so .java only) since 3.8: Project properties > Java Build Path > Compiler > Source, "Selectively ignore errors/warnings from source folders". The toggle is called "Ignore optional compile problems" and can be enabled on per-folder basis

Jul 30 12:10:26 <red-lichtie>	Hi, I've just installed the latest version of eclipse (neon) using the online installer. Now when I try to add another site I am getting the following error "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class sun.security.ssl.SSLSessionImpl"
Jul 30 12:11:48 <red-lichtie>	But the error is coming from within that class. Any ideas?
Jul 30 12:17:10 <red-lichtie>	I looks like it might be a nJVM problem
Jul 30 12:47:39 <red-lichtie>	I get the error using openjdk 8 but not with oracle, so using the "-vm" to force that one
Jul 30 17:02:58 <TheChubu>	hi! i have a question
Jul 30 17:03:12 <TheChubu>	does anybody knows where on earth i can get Eclipse launcher's icons?
Jul 30 17:03:35 <TheChubu>	afaik they do like some icons with a tiny "JEE" or "PHP" or whatever for each of the distributions
Jul 30 17:03:42 <TheChubu>	dunno where to find htem
Jul 30 22:27:01 <ecfuser71476>	Hello!
Jul 31 06:05:16 <eagles0513875_>	hey guys anyone here
Jul 31 06:07:03 <eagles0513875_>	i need some major help with exporting to a runnable jar file but for some reason im running it on the command line for testing purposes
Jul 31 06:07:18 <eagles0513875_>	and its like the jar file is not finding the java file with the class that has the main method
Jul 31 06:07:28 <eagles0513875_>	i check with java tvc on the jar file and i see the app.java file there
Jul 31 06:07:30 <eagles0513875_>	any ideas
Jul 31 06:07:56 <eagles0513875_>	running the main class from with in eclipse works fine no problem just jar file
Jul 31 09:00:56 <surial>	eagles0513875_: what exactly are you running? java -cp myjar.jar or java -jar myjar.jar? Also, separately, you should really be making these with maven, gradle, or ant, not eclipse.
Jul 31 10:11:30 <eagles0513875_>	surial: they are ant scripts im using eclipse and telling it to export everything to a runnable jar file
Jul 31 10:12:01 <eagles0513875_>	surial: thing is this was a single developer FOSS project and lead dev is stepping back. and im taking over so i am with out documentation on how things are if you like i can provide you a link to the repository.
Jul 31 10:15:38 <eagles0513875_>	surial: another issue is that this is 25 seperate projects and instead of creating an installer for each I want something which is a bit more portable
Jul 31 10:15:49 <eagles0513875_>	hence my wanting to use a runnable jar
Jul 31 11:07:16 <surial>	eagles0513875_: you should make this monolithic runnable jar with maven, gradle, or ant, and not eclipse.
Jul 31 11:07:31 <eagles0513875_>	how does one do that with ant
Jul 31 11:07:49 <eagles0513875_>	if ant scripts are spread across 25 different projects in eclipse
Jul 31 14:23:45 <Tase>	Installed jdk 1.8 x86, run eclisep-insta-win32.exe, does nothing
Jul 31 14:24:06 <Tase>	run eclipse-inst-win64.exe, shows missing 64bit jfk (as expected)
Jul 31 14:24:35 <Tase>	i went to the wiki for install instructions, but it forwards to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php?show_instructions=TRUE
Jul 31 14:24:39 <Tase>	which shows nothing
Jul 31 17:14:37 <flappynerd>	for the CDT (C++ Developer Tools) do I need the "C++ Developer Tools SDK" or is that only if I want to contribute to CDT itself?
Jul 31 19:42:56 <AlpTunga_>	Hello all
Jul 31 19:45:54 <AlpTunga_>	I had a problem about Eclipse Console doesn't get EOF (ctrl+d) as input and it was solved by updating it. It was eclipse-cpp-mars-R-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz. Something broke down and i was not able to launch it so i installed a new one from Ubuntu Software Center. Even though i updated it i still got the same problem.
Jul 31 20:05:59 <AlpTunga_>	Upgrading from previous Eclipse IDE package to Neon (4.6) is NOT supported https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_upgrade_Eclipse_IDE%3F
Jul 31 20:06:00 <AlpTunga_>	nvm.
Jul 31 20:09:56 <donald1>	I have just installed eclipse IDE with this tuto https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-java/installer-les-outils-de-developpement. I follow these instructions to setup a new project but at the selection of installed JRE after Window > Preferences I still do not see the bar situated under the name "package explorer". How to see this one to read my code on the right side and begin to code?
Jul 31 20:26:21 <davidmichaelkarr>	donald1: Sorry, but you'll have to be much more specific.  I have no idea what "do not see the bar" means. Also note that most people here will be english-speaking (and mostly not french-reading), so don't expect us to get much information from pages like that.
Jul 31 20:43:31 <donald1>	I have just installed eclipse IDE with this tuto https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-java/installer-les-outils-de-developpement. I follow these instructions to setup a new project but I can not create the left bar.
Jul 31 20:56:14 <upgrdman>	how do i attached a javadoc JAR for eclipse to see? im trying to use the Apache Commons Math library. i did the Add External JARs thing, and added the commons...jar and commons...javadoc.jar files. both are listed under Referenced Libraries. but Eclipse can't seem to see the javadoc when i hover over a method to try and see it's javadoc.
Aug 01 08:47:37 <carabia>	Question of Eclipse C/C++, when you write a function prototype, and later you define said function , is it possible for eclipse to auto-complete the parameters?
Aug 01 08:48:26 <carabia>	The way, e.g. visual studio does it, iirc
Aug 01 10:46:13 <RajRajRaj>	hi i am setting up eclipse cdt for existing code, that code required some environment variables to be set upfront in order to build it. how do i do it in eclipse build configuration.
Aug 01 14:46:38 <carabia>	I'll ask again, if anyone knows ~
Aug 01 14:46:43 <carabia>	Question of Eclipse C/C++, when you write a function prototype, and later you define said function , is it possible for eclipse to auto-complete the parameters?
Aug 01 15:41:01 <nitind>	So have you tried it, or having tried it, found it not to do that?
Aug 01 15:43:44 <themiddleman_>	Quick question, how can I access the project properties from a plugin
Aug 01 15:47:40 <nitind>	What do you mean?
Aug 01 15:48:55 <nitind>	themiddleman_: https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-core/documents/user_settings/faq.html#platformScopes and  http://help.eclipse.org/neon/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/ProjectScope.html ?
Aug 01 16:04:45 <davidmichaelkarr>	So I just tried to set up Tomcat 8.5.3 (in TomEE 7.0.1) in Eclipse, and apparently there is a long-standing required hack to the "ServerInfo.properties" file to fool Eclipse to knowing it's Tomcat 8.x. Seems strange this is still required.
Aug 01 16:09:05 <nitind>	Are you sure this doesn't fall under ~494936 ?
Aug 01 16:09:06 <Arbalest>	Bug 494936 - http://bugs.eclipse.org/494936 - WTP ServerTools / jst.server / 3.7 - All / All - NEW /  / normal / - Assignee: Larry.Isaacs - Add Tomcat 8.5 support to WTP Server Tools
Aug 01 16:11:35 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: Thanks.  Looks like that's it.  Not as long-standing as I thought.
Aug 01 16:12:30 <themiddleman_>	@nitind sry for the delay, I'm referring to project propeties, like when a project is right-clicked ->properties, is there a way I can get those same details through an eclipse plugin?
Aug 01 16:13:32 <nitind>	themiddleman_: So you don't mean accessing them, you mean opening the same dialog?
Aug 01 16:13:47 <themiddleman_>	yeah accessing them would be fine
Aug 01 16:15:18 <themiddleman_>	not really opening with a dialog
Aug 01 16:18:11 <nitind>	themiddleman_: Take a look at the two URLs I posted earlier (in the voice of Ida).
Aug 01 16:24:41 <davidmichaelkarr>	If I've created a Dynamic Web Project with the usual defaults, but I want to move step by step to a Maven organization, how do I properly move "WebContent" to "src/main/webapp"?
Aug 01 16:25:55 <themiddleman_>	@nitind so for example if a project also has git associated with it, when accessing the project properties I can see that it has git url associate with it, is there a way I can access that git URL?
Aug 01 16:29:50 <davidmichaelkarr>	Never mind.  Figured it out.
Aug 01 16:29:54 <nitind>	themiddleman_: I can only throw you at the jgit API, http://download.eclipse.org/jgit/site/4.4.1.201607150455-r/apidocs/index.html . The project isn't usually the git root itself.
Aug 01 16:32:24 <themiddleman_>	@nitind , ahhh ok
Aug 01 17:21:57 <themiddleman_>	hmmm, another dead end...
Aug 01 17:22:36 <themiddleman_>	is there a way to get the remote repository url of a project through a plugin?
Aug 01 17:25:21 <nitind>	Have you looked at how the GitProjectPropertyPage figures it out?
Aug 01 17:28:24 <themiddleman_>	@nitind , I have not, looking at it right now
Aug 01 18:27:36 <themiddleman_>	ok phew! Finally got it
Aug 01 19:45:52 <carabia>	nitind, I have not found a way to do it, if you asked me earlier.
Aug 01 19:46:34 <carabia>	I just figured, at least myself I found it kind of a crucial feature
Aug 01 19:47:02 <carabia>	Maybe not crucial, but a really really amazing quality of life -type of thing.
Aug 01 19:52:59 <themiddleman_>	so in order to get the git remote url for a project, I first get all the projects (IProject). 2. Iterating through all the projects I get the GITProvider through RepositoryProvider.getProvider. 3. get the repositoryMappings.entrySet, and iterate through the entrySet. 4.Get the repository from the RepositoryMapping, then follow http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2011/08/16/jgit-api-reading-configuration-information/

Aug 02 13:25:27 <davidmichaelkarr>	When running a REST service app in Tomcat in Eclipse, is there any way to prevent it from creating an editor view attempting to access the root url of the project?
Aug 02 13:37:39 <cores>	i have a really simple question, i want to open an existing c++ in place (it's in a source controlled directory), i don't want to "import" it. how can I do that?
Aug 02 13:38:05 <cores>	an existing c++ project in place, i mean
Aug 02 13:43:00 <cores>	i hope this "import existing projects into workspace" did the trick
Aug 02 13:43:50 <cores>	this "eclipse way" of doing things is confusing to a newcomer fresh off a vim,make,git workflow
Aug 02 13:44:36 <cores>	projects, workspaces, impoting, perspectives... what is going on..?

Aug 02 20:34:18 <donald1>	Ican create a new project but I can not edit it or open it on eclipse
Aug 02 21:40:44 <brandan>	what the directory where eclipse stores all it's settings in linux?
Aug 02 21:41:25 <brandan>	hmm
Aug 02 21:41:29 <brandan>	nvm
Aug 02 22:04:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: I figured it out.  It's a little weird, but even though Eclipse refers to the same Tomcat distro, it doesn't use the same server configs as the distro is using. I had to import the modified file into the server definition (which also strangely confused the server itself, because it wouldn't let me save the file until I stopped the server, but Eclipse
Aug 02 22:04:10 <davidmichaelkarr>	thought the server was already stopped. Restarting Eclipse fixed that.), then I could make additional changes to the imported files.
Aug 03 03:24:13 <Mazi>	Hi eclipse experts, can someone help with a question about Egit?
Aug 03 03:25:23 <Mazi>	At my local Git project I have edited some files and also added a new folder/library with ~500 files. How can I commit the new folder only? When using Team -> commit I get the list of all changed files but I want to commit the single folder + its files only.
Aug 03 03:25:24 <Arbalest>	Bug 500 does not exist.
Aug 03 03:39:11 <Stummi>	Mazi, git does not know anything about directories
Aug 03 03:39:21 <Stummi>	thats why you can't commit empty directories into a git repo
Aug 03 03:40:05 <Mazi>	Stummi, it is not empty. I just wonder if there is any easy way to commit a single directory only without other files which were also edited.
Aug 03 03:42:34 <Stummi>	ah, right, sorry. Misread your message
Aug 03 03:43:16 <Stummi>	not sure, I normally do stuff like this from the command line
Aug 03 04:09:16 <khlorghaal>	does CDT not support c++ 11? im getting erroneous errors and stackoverflow fixes arent working
Aug 03 04:09:40 <khlorghaal>	im using neon now, i was using indigo in the past and everything was fine
Aug 03 05:19:07 <khlorghaal>	started a new project and everything, bah ill just redownload indigo, its not like neon is a perceptible improvement
Aug 03 05:23:03 <khlorghaal>	there seems to be hundreds of people having issues like this and no fixes
Aug 03 07:15:11 <cores>	nitind: say you have a bunch of directories with make files and .cproject and .project files. how do i open them in eclipse so that i'm editing the files themselves, not just copies of the files?
Aug 03 07:15:23 <cores>	if that question even makes sense, obviously i'm a little confused
Aug 03 07:24:16 <jrtappers>	Is there a way to build an update site without launching a GUI instance of eclipse?
Aug 03 07:26:20 <jrtappers>	https://wiki.eclipse.org/PDE/User_Guide doesn't seem to have a section for update sites
Aug 03 09:06:41 <cores>	i feel like customizing eclipse is a full time job

Aug 03 12:52:12 <Jasaka>	If, while working, I remove a TODO or FIXME but it still displays as being there, how can I fix that? Or more generally: If eclipses error, warning or normal markers lag behind, how can I reload(?) them. Sorry if I'm not clear in my question as I'm not a native speaker.
Aug 03 12:58:46 <cores>	good question
Aug 03 12:58:50 <cores>	i have the same thing
Aug 03 13:03:05 <Jasaka>	Normally, it seems (with small projects) it reloads them on saving. But after a long time of work on a bigger project it just bugs out. I have a few classes which are now fully blue-underlined.
Aug 03 13:04:36 <psuzzi>	This seems a bug. Can you take a screenshot / anim gif, and report a new bug on Platform UI ?

Aug 03 16:28:14 <nitind>	cores: Once the git clone is in the Git Repositories View, use the context menu in the working directory tree to Import Projects from there. They will not be copied.
Aug 03 16:28:44 <nitind>	Jasaka: For what kind of file?
Aug 03 18:45:01 <Saul775>	Hello.  I'm creating a JAR file that uses Microsoft's JDBC driver.  However, everytime the method is invoked, I get a ClassNotFoundException.  I've had some help from people in #java and the Internet.  I'm instructed to set the classpath.  I thought I did this, but I still get the exception.  Where do I set the classpath in Eclipse?
Aug 03 18:45:21 <Saul775>	I've tried setting it under Window --> Preferences --> Java --> Build Path --> Classpath Variables.   Is this the correct location?
Aug 03 19:00:32 <nitind>	You would add the jar itself as a jar to the Java Build Path.
Aug 03 19:05:35 <Saul775>	Thank you, nitind.  I think I did this because I can see the JAR file under my referenced libraries.  Is this correct?
Aug 03 20:20:19 <nitind>	Saul775: yes. proably. haven't done JDBC in a while.

Aug 04 04:13:22 <waits_>	Is it possible to skip all the breakpoints until a certain method is executed in the call stack? I don't want to remove them.
Aug 04 04:27:30 <Amis>	Hello! I'm on Neon RC1 and I have a really hard time configuring C++11 support. I have a Makefile project with some custom (non-makefile) builder script and no matter what I do the eclipse indexer does not recognize the C++11 containers and elements. Some configuration settings: http://imgur.com/a/QECqv I've restarted several times and rebuild the index.
Aug 04 04:27:38 <Amis>	What am I doing wrong?
Aug 04 04:29:26 <Amis>	Is there some other magical settings hidden where I have to specify the flags?
Aug 04 04:30:12 <Amis>	Note that when I open a header that contains C++11 elements (like <memory>) then eclipse tells me that the __cplusplus define is not defined and excludes the code it guards
Aug 04 04:32:20 <Amis>	Correction: it says __cplusplus is defined as '199711L'
Aug 04 04:42:52 <Amis>	Thank god it solved itself because I was about the split my desk in half. It turns out that my freshly created Makefile project was not using the global provider settings so it did not have the "-std=c++11" flag added.
Aug 04 07:35:51 <Guest47968>	How can I make EGit ignore git repositories in subdirectories on pull? I just want to pull the top-level repository and not all git repositries in subdirectories.
Aug 04 12:05:37 <jmspeex>	Anyone knows how to prevent the "build on save" feature from triggering an infinite loop of builds on my project?
Aug 04 12:06:10 <jmspeex>	It started happening after I upgraded from Mars to Neon (upgrading Fedora 22 to Fedora 24)
Aug 04 12:45:43 <nitind>	That's really up to the builders.
Aug 04 12:46:20 <nitind>	wainersm: You can Disable the other breakpoints without fully Removing them. Check the Breakpoints View.

Aug 04 14:40:10 <ipun>	Arbalest thanks, will do
Aug 04 14:47:14 <ipun>	Considering this atricle is about 7 years old, I am wondering how I can extend org.eclipse.ui.ide.markersupport'
Aug 04 14:47:41 <ipun>	's markerField. The article is here: http://blog.eclipse-tips.com/2008/11/creating-custom-marker-view.html
Aug 04 14:49:47 <nitind>	That's a question to ask only after you've tried it and found out that it doesn't work that way any more.
Aug 04 15:05:30 <ipun>	nitind, i've currently been trying it on an existing extension point, the Problems view. I'm trying to get the "projects" column to display
Aug 04 15:06:26 <nitind>	What does the Problems View have to do with it?
Aug 04 15:07:47 <ipun>	im trying to develop something on the Problems view, so i am trying to get an additional field to come up, more importantly, the projects column to start
Aug 04 15:46:04 <jrtappers>	I seem to be having an issue with classes used for preferences
Aug 04 15:46:33 <jrtappers>	I get null pointers for private static final strings that have the value set immediately
Aug 04 15:46:58 <jrtappers>	private static final FOO = "bar";
Aug 04 15:47:05 <jrtappers>	And then the value later on is null
Aug 04 15:50:47 <nitind>	Where?
Aug 04 15:50:51 <nitind>	Also in a static?
Aug 04 15:54:44 <jrtappers>	Statics and also instance methods
Aug 04 15:55:15 <jrtappers>	Mainly static methods though
Aug 04 15:59:16 <jrtappers>	It seems to be ok if I have a static method that sets the values and manually call it before getting the values [removing the final], but not if it is declared and assigned together, although this seems like a messy workaround
Aug 04 16:11:47 <jrtappers>	Similar example - http://pastebin.com/ZR5EUBkS - On line 64 vals contains 12 nulls
Aug 04 16:12:17 <jrtappers>	It is a similar issue in enums
Aug 04 16:15:27 <jrtappers>	The method [setDefaults()] is called from a method [initializeDefaultPreferences()] which is part of a class registered as a PreferenceInitializer

Aug 05 11:13:06 <davidmichaelkarr>	I'm running Tomcat (TomEE) from Eclipse, and after I renamed a project (cloned, deleted old one), now Tomcat is confused with some sort of JMX error at container startup.  Is there some cache I need to delete?
Aug 05 12:00:13 <nitind>	Gamoder_: Is there a bug report?
Aug 05 12:00:23 <nitind>	davidmichaelkarr: confused how?
Aug 05 12:01:21 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: " java.lang.ClassCastException: Cannot cast org.apache.cxf.management.jmx.InstrumentationManagerImpl to org.apache.cxf.management.InstrumentationManager".  This might be a CXF and/or TomEE problem.  I'm pursuing this on #openejb also.
Aug 05 12:01:49 <davidmichaelkarr>	nitind: But I didn't see this error before I "renamed" the project (cloned, then deleted old one).
Aug 05 12:01:53 <nitind>	Looks like a classloader problem. Weird.

Aug 09 12:00:07 <davidmichaelkarr>	Ah.  I just had to select the file I wanted added to ignore list.
Aug 09 12:07:57 <davidmichaelkarr>	Curious.  The "Add to svn:ignore" function is clearly bound to "Ctrl+Alt+I", but pressing that key after selecting a resource to be ignored does nothing. You still have to right-click and select the option in the submenu.

Aug 11 01:24:00 <luxigo>	Ok now we have a dark theme after ten years.... but why is it still so much a pain in the sas to darken the background more (I mean to black) and not only the editor window ?  (It's not a question, its an exasperatid sigh...)
Aug 11 01:24:26 <luxigo>	ted
Aug 11 01:24:32 <luxigo>	*SIGH*
Aug 11 04:21:41 <lilalinux>	How do you hide the "Javascript Resources" virtual folder from Project Explorer?
Aug 11 04:21:59 <lilalinux>	It can't be removed via the triangle menu
Aug 11 08:43:14 <NightStrike>	If I want an eclipse IDE that combines CDT and normal java editing, what's the best way to go about putting that together?  I could for instance have two installations (probably the worst choice), I could d/l CDT and try to install Java plugins, I could d/l the basic java ide and try ot install CDT to it, or some other option?
Aug 11 08:52:54 <NightStrike>	Using the installer seems to prefer putting each IDE in a separate directory.... eclipse/cpp-neon and eclipse/java-neon....   but that seems to indicate that I need two very separate IDEs
Aug 11 09:13:11 <lilalinux>	NightStrike: I always find it easier to start with CDT and then possible other stuff
Aug 11 09:42:08 <mpiggott>	With Neon I've started to get a bunch of 'java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xml.namespace.XMLNamespacePackage' while Auto-Saving Workspace. Restarting Eclipse entirely loses the perspective's layout and tiles all the views
Aug 11 09:43:51 <mpiggott>	Also another EMF related stack trace for Oomph 'Setup Check'
Aug 11 10:01:51 <Kakemo>	Hi, I'm coding in C++ with Eclipse and I'm having trouble installing GMP and linking it with Eclipse. Can someone help me ?
Aug 11 10:46:15 <freeone3000>	Hi. On a fresh install of Eclipse Neon, attempting to start it gives me "Eclipse could not start the Virtual Machine. Eclipse will now exit." However, I don't have an error log in the application directory - where should I look for the eclipse logs for this issue?
Aug 11 10:47:30 <freeone3000>	I haven't chosen a workspace yet, so it's not there either.
Aug 11 10:48:07 <mpiggott>	freeone3000, possibly the working directory or ~/.eclipse maybe?
Aug 11 10:49:47 <freeone3000>	mpiggott: No, no logs - it does have infos.txt which lists the JVMs and which one it chose, though, and it's a valid JVM.
Aug 11 10:50:57 <mpiggott>	freeone3000, there is also the cli option -consoleLog https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_Where_can_I_find_that_elusive_.log_file%3F
Aug 11 10:52:45 <freeone3000>	Ah. "Java started but returned exit code 1". And then immediately exits. That's... better, I guess.
Aug 11 11:16:56 <nitind>	freeone3000: "it's a valid JVM" --which one was it?
Aug 11 13:26:52 <freeone3000>	nitind: Oracle 1.8.0 64-bit.
Aug 11 13:31:15 <nitind>	freeone3000: More specific than that?
Aug 11 13:31:53 <freeone3000>	nitind: "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0;1;8;0;64;true;1395170345840"?
Aug 11 13:33:17 <nitind>	freeone3000: I really meant is it the newest 1.8.0, and I trust this is a 64-bit Neon download?
Aug 11 13:35:13 <freeone3000>	nitind: Launcher library is "C:\Users\temp\.p2\pool\plugins\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_64_1.1.400.v20160518-1444". And the JDK is b132, so not *newest* but not terribly old.
Aug 11 13:36:36 <nitind>	From the Command Prompt, are you able to run that installed copy of java.exe?
Aug 11 13:37:33 <freeone3000>	nitind: Yes.
Aug 11 13:37:47 <nitind>	How'd you install Neon?
Aug 11 13:38:14 <freeone3000>	nitind: There was a x64 installer on eclipse.org, co-branded "oomph". I downloaded and ran that.
Aug 11 13:41:39 <nitind>	Have you edited the eclipse.ini file manually?
Aug 11 13:41:48 <freeone3000>	No, this is a fresh install.
Aug 11 14:04:03 <nitind>	Where did it get installed?
Aug 11 14:05:39 <freeone3000>	nitind: C:\Users\temp\eclipse
Aug 11 14:05:47 <freeone3000>	nitind: %HOME% is C:\Users\temp
Aug 11 14:07:30 <nitind>	This launcher library detail, did a dialog pop open with the -1 and bunch of other stuff
Aug 11 14:07:34 <nitind>	?
Aug 11 14:07:57 <freeone3000>	nitind: Yeah, it gave me the error code 1 and the list of launch options.
Aug 11 14:08:12 <nitind>	Can you post the ~image ?
Aug 11 14:08:12 <Arbalest>	Please upload your screenshots online and then paste the link back to the channel - http://imgur.com/ - http://imagebin.ca/
Aug 11 14:38:44 <themiddleman>	hello all
Aug 11 14:41:01 <freeone3000>	nitind: https://imgur.com/a/XVsnP
Aug 11 14:44:08 <nitind>	freeone3000: Can you try editing the c:\Users\temp\eclipse\cpp-neon\eclipse\eclipse.ini file and removing the lines that start with -XX: ?
Aug 11 14:46:59 <freeone3000>	nitind: Alright, that gets me to the splash screen. Thanks.
Aug 11 14:47:19 <themiddleman>	somewhat quick question, my computer had restarted abruptly and it seems as if eclipse doesn't seem to recognize any plugin dependencies I have for my plugin project
Aug 11 14:47:42 <nitind>	dependencies that are in the workspace?
Aug 11 14:49:50 <themiddleman>	err they are for a plugin project
Aug 11 14:50:02 <nitind>	still applies
Aug 11 14:50:27 <themiddleman>	they are more like dependencies that should be with eclipse like org.eclipse.jface
Aug 11 14:50:37 <themiddleman>	or org.eclipse.ui
Aug 11 14:50:59 <nitind>	Information about where those are on-disk might have gone squirrely. From the preference page (Preferences > Plug-in Development > Target Platform), try Removing the Running Platform target definition, Applying, and then Restoring Defaults.
Aug 11 14:51:17 <nitind>	Or, at the last, putting them back the way you'd put them before.
Aug 11 14:52:37 <themiddleman>	ahhh ok thanks that did the trick
Aug 11 14:53:05 <freeone3000>	nitind: Yep, everything's working now! Weird that the -XX were specified by default when they didn't work, thanks.
Aug 12 12:31:42 <Restioson>	Hi. How can I prevent eGit from creating a folder inside of my repo and putting my stuff there instead of at it's root?
Aug 12 14:39:45 <chealer>	hi. when I open a function documentation page from PHP's manual via Content assist proposals, it strangely opens in a small tooltip-like zone in Eclipse rather than in my browser. Is this a known issue and if not, can it open in my browser?
Aug 12 14:41:51 <chealer>	Version 4.6.0 on Windows, with Eclipse set to use Firefox.
Aug 12 16:20:14 <chealer>	I reported in ticket #499629
Aug 13 02:59:19 <upgrdman>	are there any plugins for profiling java program per line (not just per-function time, but "hot spots" with line granularity) ?
Aug 13 11:44:45 <donald>	how to display old projects to the package explorer of eclipse?
Aug 14 02:31:06 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Pardon.. I'm quietly lusing my mind.  When creating an SWT button, there is an autocomplete for adding a selection listener.
Aug 14 02:32:09 <Frigid_Cryotank>	Button b1 = new Button(shell, SWT.PUSH);  b1.addSelectionListener(new SelectionAdapter()   and there is something here that causes Eclipse to offer to add missing methods.
Aug 14 14:04:13 <idzireit>	not sure if i am in the correct channel or maybe I need to go to a java channel but I have need of help in java and I am using eclipse
Aug 14 15:04:04 <idzireit>	I am not sure how to ask this question but I need help configuring eclipse
Aug 14 15:05:00 <idzireit>	I have a java program written by my cousin and he gave me the source files to compile but I get 43 errors
Aug 14 15:05:29 <idzireit>	java.lang.object cannot be resolved
Aug 14 19:02:06 <jya>	hi... attempting to use eclipse neon, with EGit 4.4, I can't figure out for the life of me how to access git-blame. All my searching shows that i should start by going to the team menu, and select "Show Annotations", but there's no such entry.
Aug 14 19:27:43 <iman>	Hi, I am trying to run same .war file in same wildfly in both linux and windows, in windows everything is good but in linux I get this error message, Internal Exception: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: eclipselink.tolerate-invalid-jpql; what do you think that would be ?

Aug 15 02:48:56 <crazy6>	I am trying to duplicate a workspace from an example (containing a project), but with a different (derivative) code project in the new workspace. I am trying to get the debug configuration/launch to migrate over, but it doesn't seem to come up, even when I copied the .metadata dir . Any idea what may be going wrong? The 1 project in the workspace does have a different name.
