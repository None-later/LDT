Jul 27 02:43:00 <themiddleman>	Hello all
Jul 27 02:48:37 <themiddleman>	hello, quick question, I'm developing a plugin for eclipse and I'm wondering what kind of extension would I use that would listen for various modals that the user would open up, i.e. new project, about, properties, to name a few?
