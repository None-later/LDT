Aug 11 01:25:07 <luxigo>	Ok now we have a dark theme after ten years.... but why is it still so much a pain in the sas to darken the background more (I mean to black) and not only the editor window ?  (It's not a question, its an exasperated sigh...)
Aug 11 01:26:34 <luxigo>	a slider for darken/lighten the background would be nice :-)
Aug 11 01:26:42 <luxigo>	brighten :-)
Aug 11 02:18:25 <nitind>	I sometimes wonder if people just never turn down their screen brightness.

Sep 07 03:46:39 <psuzzi>	Hi! I'm implementing search in Workspace from QuickAcces, and I've a question on using performTextSearchWorkingSet.
Sep 07 03:46:45 <psuzzi>	In Bug 500833 - [QuickAccess] Allow Text search, I added a new quickaccess entry to launch the search in workspace, and I can launch the search in workspace, but I'm not able to pass the "text to search" to the command.
Sep 07 03:46:52 <psuzzi>	I know the ID of the command: "org.eclipse.search.ui.performTextSearchWorkingSet", and I can invoke it, but I can not pass the search text, as the command takes the search text from the current selection.
Sep 07 03:46:58 <psuzzi>	So, the questions is: does anybody knows how to pass the search text to the command performTextSearchWorkingSet ?
Sep 07 03:47:03 <psuzzi>	Current code in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500833#c5,
Sep 07 03:47:03 <psuzzi>	(from change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/80483/5/ )
Sep 07 03:48:50 <psuzzi>	pardon me, the Command ID is: org.eclipse.search.ui.performTextSearchWorkspace

Sep 07 14:00:27 <vastu5996>	hi, i am new to eclipse development, recently i am encountering this error while cloning eclipse projects :
Sep 07 14:00:33 <vastu5996>	premature EOF
Sep 07 14:00:48 <vastu5996>	index-failed
Sep 07 14:01:37 <vastu5996>	What might be the possible reasons and solutions for this issue?
Sep 09 07:02:11 <psuzzi>	I have a file resource loaded from an InputSource/InputStream.
Sep 09 07:02:12 <psuzzi>	How can I get the bundle-Id for the bundle containing that resource?
Sep 09 12:50:35 <nitind>	psuzzi: If you only have an input stream, that information has been lost.
Sep 09 12:50:54 <psuzzi>	nitind: thanks!
Sep 09 13:01:06 <psuzzi>	actually I had a org.w3c.css.sac.InputSource, but I think that is the same.
Sep 09 13:41:12 <nitind>	That might have the original URI in it. Depends on how the InputSource was instantiated.

Sep 16 08:49:49 <mistria>	psuzzi: apparently it was ;)

Sep 16 08:50:22 <mistria>	psuzzi: I don't remember the warning neither...
Sep 16 08:51:28 <psuzzi>	mistria: same for me, I think it will be good having a place where to check to see if the master is closed
Sep 16 08:52:05 <mistria>	psuzzi: or better, find a way to not require master to close

Oct 04 09:28:42 <gaccounts>	Looking at https://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/Eclipse_Build, would you say that's an up to date instruction for building from source?
Oct 04 09:30:42 <gaccounts>	Hmm, it points to http://download.eclipse.org/technology/linuxtools/eclipse-build/ which does not have any links to 4.4 (or later)
Oct 04 09:31:07 <mbooth>	gaccounts: No, CBI project took over, so a more accurate document is probably this one: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform-releng/Platform_Build
Oct 04 09:31:50 <mbooth>	(I.e. maven build)
Oct 04 09:31:56 <gaccounts>	mbooth, ok thanks.  Ultimately what I wanted first was to get a complete corresponding source code of a known build for example one of the downloadable distros like -DSL
Oct 04 09:32:23 <gaccounts>	I imagine following the instructions for building is the first step...   or are there actually corresponding source bundles downloadable (I can't seem to find them on typical mirrors)
Oct 04 09:32:53 <gaccounts>	^^ distros meaning a particular downloadable Eclipse variant
Oct 04 09:33:44 <mbooth>	gaccounts: For the Eclipse platform, sources that comprise a release have well-known tags. For example, Eclipse Platform Neon.1 is: http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator.git/tag/?h=R4_6_1
Oct 04 09:35:51 <gaccounts>	ok, but then I guess I should follow some build instructions to recursively acquire all the relevant packages that are part of something like the -DSL release right?
Oct 04 09:36:23 <gaccounts>	I mean all parts won't all be in the same git repo I imagine.
Oct 04 09:37:43 <mbooth>	gaccounts: Of course, follow the directions in the doc I posted to build the platform -- the other constituent parts of a "distro" are different projects
Oct 04 09:38:25 <gaccounts>	got it, I'll try the build instructions and see where that takes me.   I'm correct in that there are no source bundles that make up everything corresponding to a "distro" (wrong word probably but you know what I mean)
Oct 04 09:38:38 <gaccounts>	^^ that's correct right?
Oct 04 09:39:21 <mbooth>	Right. In general, the products that are available for download are made up of the base Eclipse platform plus a whole host of other projects that participate in the release
Oct 04 09:40:26 <mbooth>	gaccounts: See here for all the git repos for all the eclipse.org projects (there are many): http://git.eclipse.org/c/
Oct 04 09:41:10 <gaccounts>	OK redistribution of such combined products is a little tricky from license perspective if you have to distribute (or offer) all the corresponding source code.
Oct 04 09:41:39 <gaccounts>	it seems the Eclipse project itself does not really do that with the distributed bundles (at least not in an easy to understand way?)
Oct 04 09:42:22 <mbooth>	gaccounts: What do you mean, from a license perspective? All eclipse.org code should be EPL, no?
Oct 04 09:42:28 <gaccounts>	right
Oct 04 09:42:45 <gaccounts>	and epl requires you to offer the source code to whomever you distribute to, agreed?
Oct 04 09:42:52 <gaccounts>	so you need to know what that source code is
Oct 04 09:43:13 <gaccounts>	unless I've misunderstood the license...
Oct 04 09:43:58 <mbooth>	gaccounts: All the source is there...
Oct 04 09:44:06 <gaccounts>	"there"? where?
Oct 04 09:44:27 <gaccounts>	that's what I meant with "in an easy to understand way"
Oct 04 09:44:42 <gaccounts>	I am sure all the source is available and can be figured out.
Oct 04 09:45:45 <gaccounts>	I think we're in agreement.  I'll start with a maven build, since it must pull down all the relevant source so that's the answer I think...
Oct 04 09:46:57 <gaccounts>	mbooth, thanks for your help by the way
Oct 04 09:48:19 <mbooth>	Sure
Oct 04 09:49:27 <mbooth>	gaccounts: Here is the repo that contains the product definitions for the "distros": http://git.eclipse.org/c/epp/org.eclipse.epp.packages.git/tree/packages/
Oct 04 09:50:25 <gaccounts>	ah ok, so something like  package.dsl.product would be the dsl version of eclipse?
Oct 04 09:50:33 <gaccounts>	s/be/define/
Oct 04 09:51:12 <mbooth>	Yeah. But again, you will see that the eclipse platform is only one part of the product.
Oct 04 09:51:28 <gaccounts>	ok
Oct 04 10:13:07 <nitind>	Check the manifest in each plug-in. There should be a source reference to the original CVS or git repo for most modern builds.
Oct 04 15:21:00 <rawbdor>	anyone here know how ot build wtp stuff?  i just get non-resolvable parent pom
Oct 04 15:21:15 <rawbdor>	[ERROR]     Non-resolvable parent POM: Failure to find org.eclipse:wtp-parent:pom:3.6.0-SNAPSHOT in https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of jboss-snapshots-repository has elapsed or updates are forced and 'parent.relativePath' points at wrong local POM @ line 17, column 11 -> [Help 2]
Oct 04 15:39:25 <nitind>	From where are you starting, and what's with the jboss.org?
Oct 04 15:51:01 <rawbdor>	nitind,   i have ssh://rstryker@git.eclipse.org/gitroot/jeetools/webtools.javaee.git (fetch)   cloned basically
Oct 04 15:51:11 <rawbdor>	no idea why it's looking exclusively in jboss.org
Oct 04 15:51:17 <rawbdor>	its probably part of my default settings.xml for maven
Oct 04 15:52:44 <nitind>	Usually I'd say to look at what the hudson invocation is (https://hudson.eclipse.org/webtools/job/javaee-gerrit/lastBuild/consoleFull). A full WTP build usually starts with the aggregator repo, right?

Oct 04 16:02:37 <rawbdor>	but thats not working
Oct 04 16:02:42 <nitind>	What happens instead?
Oct 04 16:04:01 <rawbdor>	same problem
Oct 04 16:04:03 <rawbdor>	basically cant find parent pom

Oct 04 16:04:14 <rawbdor>	my local settings.xml has several repos etc
Oct 04 16:04:20 <rawbdor>	but i dont have any eclipse or wtp ones
Oct 04 16:05:41 <rgrunber>	rawbdor: what happens if you add '-U' to the maven call
Oct 04 16:06:21 <rgrunber>	hmm nvm..
Oct 04 16:06:27 <rgrunber>	there is no wtp-parent in that repo..
Oct 04 16:08:04 <rawbdor>	yeah :|
Oct 04 16:08:08 <rawbdor>	for now im using gerrit
Oct 04 16:08:13 <rawbdor>	as my build system =P
Oct 04 16:08:17 <rawbdor>	feel kinda bad about it tho
Oct 04 16:08:19 <rgrunber>	so that relative path means it's actually there .. so it's expecting to find it on the path.

Oct 25 14:01:44 <epatpol>	but how do I configure my plugin to fetch its dependencies from another maven repository, is it possible?

Oct 26 10:21:07 <rgrunber>	is download.eclipse.org non-responsive for anyone else ? (it's there.. just not really responding over http)
Oct 26 10:22:09 <rgrunber>	seems back up.. nvm
Oct 26 11:35:43 <epatpol>	I'm still stuck on this, how do I include an external jar to an eclipse plug-in? It's not on orbit or in an update site
Oct 26 11:38:34 <mbooth>	epatpol: You can tell tycho to consider normal maven pom dependencies as part of the target platform: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform#.22POM_dependencies_consider.22
Oct 26 11:42:16 <epatpol>	thanks mbooth, I'll see if that works!
Oct 26 15:02:56 <epatpol>	I'm just trying to add an external jar to a sample plug-in that has no pom yet (generated from eclipse->new project)
Oct 26 15:03:17 <epatpol>	adding it to the classpath via the plugin.xml seems to break everything
Oct 26 15:03:39 <epatpol>	I'm not very familiar with tycho so it's all very confusing to me
Oct 26 15:10:05 <Smasher>	what is an external jar? a bundle? a plugin? a feature?
Oct 26 15:11:09 <Smasher>	if its a non-osgi jar you need either to wrap it or to embed it to your plugin
Oct 26 15:20:29 <epatpol>	yes, a non-osgi jar
Oct 26 15:20:59 <epatpol>	I discovered that from vogella https://github.com/reficio/p2-maven-plugin
Oct 26 15:21:29 <epatpol>	and I managed to make an update site from those jars
Oct 26 15:22:14 <epatpol>	but if you know how to "embed" the jar in the plugin
Oct 26 15:22:20 <epatpol>	that could be helpful also!
Oct 26 15:22:23 <epatpol>	and maybe less tedious
Oct 26 15:29:03 <nitind>	You are at least exploring the Plug-in Manifest Editor, right?
Oct 26 15:30:06 <epatpol>	yes
Oct 26 15:30:17 <Smasher>	epatpol well, you need to pack the jar into your plugin and add it to the Bundle-Classpath in your Manifest.mf
Oct 26 15:30:58 <Smasher>	yourjar.jar!/embedded.jar -> Bundle-Classpath: ., embedded.jar
Oct 26 15:31:02 <Smasher>	"." is important
Oct 26 15:31:52 <epatpol>	it may sound like a dumb question but why is the "." important, I noticed it automatically added it when using the classpath->add button to my jar
Oct 26 15:37:45 <Smasher>	there's only those objects on the classpath which you declare in that header
Oct 26 15:37:59 <Smasher>	lol, if the root of your jar is not on the classpath, then there's no folders inside you are on the classpath
Oct 26 15:39:29 <epatpol>	hmmmm
Oct 26 15:49:33 <epatpol>	yea it seems to work so far Smasher, thanks!
Oct 26 15:50:22 <Smasher>	np ;)
Oct 26 15:50:23 <epatpol>	does anyone know why some plugin projects have plugin.xml and some others don't?
Oct 26 15:53:02 <Smasher>	not sure but may be you mixup plugins with features?
Oct 26 15:55:32 <Smasher>	or plugins with a simple osgi-bundles without extension points?
Oct 26 15:58:12 <epatpol>	I just generated a new plug-in project with the default eclipse code and it generated a plugin.xml, however, when I look at other existing plug-in project, say a mylyn connector that has a xxxx.core plugin or xxxxx.ui plugin
Oct 26 15:58:18 <epatpol>	both of them don't have plugin.xml files
Oct 26 15:59:05 <epatpol>	but when I open the manifest file in their respective META-INF, it opens up the same editor as if I was opening the plugin.xml
Oct 26 15:59:08 <epatpol>	that is a bit confusing
Oct 26 16:03:08 <epatpol>	I should read up on osgi I guess
Oct 26 16:30:16 <Smasher>	there is onlz one such editor, which edits mainfest files
Oct 26 16:30:41 <Smasher>	the plugin manifest editor
Oct 26 16:30:49 <Smasher>	it is used for MANIFEST.MF, plugin.xml, fragment.xml and build.properties
Oct 26 16:30:55 <Smasher>	no matter if one of them is missing
Oct 26 16:32:14 <Smasher>	regading your another question: there is a plugin.xml in mylyn commons core org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.core_3.20.0.v20160421-1819.jar\plugin.xml
Oct 26 16:33:18 <Smasher>	jars without plugin.xml are no plugins but just osgi-bundles providing some byte code for another components
Oct 26 16:39:31 <Smasher>	epatpol plugins are extension points consumer or provider.. if there's no plugin.xml there's no connection to any extention point, therefore this is not a plugin

Nov 10 14:32:01 <gercan>	rgrunber: looking for the Orbit king
Nov 10 14:37:54 <rgrunber>	gercan: hey :P
Nov 10 14:38:15 <rgrunber>	gercan: is this about clojure ?
Nov 10 14:38:31 <rgrunber>	*google closure
Nov 10 14:38:40 <gercan>	yes
Nov 10 14:39:22 <gercan>	rgrunber: we had some trobule with it
Nov 10 14:39:46 <gercan>	rgrunber: google does not have versions on that package
Nov 10 14:40:07 <gercan>	http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.google.javascript%22%20AND%20a%3A%22closure-compiler%22
Nov 10 14:40:54 <gercan>	rgrunber: they are of form vYYYYMMDD so EBR generates a 0.0.0 version bundle
Nov 10 14:42:37 <rgrunber>	gercan: is there a standard for osgi-ifying bundles whose upstream specify no versioning.
Nov 10 14:43:10 <gercan>	rgrunber: I am not aware of any...
Nov 10 14:43:31 <gercan>	rgrunber: of course 0.0.0 makes it hard to reference
Nov 10 14:43:37 <rgrunber>	i'm thinking if 0.0.0 would be fine and just have the qualifier match their version..
Nov 10 14:43:43 <rgrunber>	yeah..
Nov 10 14:44:19 <gercan>	if/when we generate a new one with a new version it will just be 0.0.0
Nov 10 14:44:58 <akurtakov>	go for version YYYYMMDD ?
Nov 10 14:45:08 <rgrunber>	or something like 0.0.YYYMMDD ..
Nov 10 14:46:20 <gercan>	0.0.YYYMMDD better perhaps... In case they suddenly decide to put version numbers :)
Nov 10 14:46:59 <rgrunber>	on the other hand it is wrong in terms of what that usually means at eclipse (security fix).
Nov 10 14:48:46 <rgrunber>	how does maven handle 'v20161024' vs say a proper version.
Nov 10 14:51:10 <gercan>	maven versions are not like OSGis, they are exact
Nov 10 14:53:13 <rgrunber>	ah yah good call.
Nov 10 14:56:17 <gercan>	rgrunber: we could file an issue to the project to correct it but that will not happen quickly
Nov 10 14:56:20 <gercan>	if ever
Nov 10 14:56:31 <rgrunber>	gercan: haven't really looked into it but could you just always set the build qualifier rather than taking what timestamp maven gives you ?
Nov 10 14:57:33 <gercan>	rgrunber: set where?
Nov 10 14:59:38 <rgrunber>	tycho-packaging-plugin takes 'format' for build timestamp.
Nov 10 15:01:50 <gercan>	rgrunber: I am concerned that p2 may not handle dependencues correctly without the 3 piece version number in place
Nov 10 15:04:08 <rgrunber>	gercan: it should.. looking at OSGiVersion in p2.metadata if 2 things are compared and identical, it does a compare on the qualifiers.
Nov 10 15:06:34 <rgrunber>	ugh.. yeah i see your point.. i'd have to look into p2 and see it doesn't do something weird anywhere like just ignore qualifiers altogether..
Nov 10 15:09:13 <rgrunber>	gercan: in that case i'd go with 0.0.YYYYMMDD .. for now and maybe see later what versioning plans upstream has.
Nov 10 15:19:57 <gercan>	rgrunber: ok thanks
Nov 10 15:20:30 <gercan>	rgrunber: I am also confused about the contact information on ip_log.xml
Nov 10 15:21:12 <gercan>	rgrunber: whose contact are those? Upstream projects or just me as the repackager?
Nov 10 15:21:41 <rgrunber>	gercan: the packager (you).. they'll show up on pages like http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops/R20160520211859/ so it can be seen who packaged what.
Nov 10 15:23:30 <gercan>	rgrunber: this was really helpful your highness thanks
Nov 10 15:24:54 <rgrunber>	gercan: well sorry i couldn't give a clearer answer on the versioning. first time i run into such case in Eclipse land. youtube-dl does a YYYY-MM-DD format but i'm pretty sure they have no intention of doing more conventional versioning.
Nov 10 15:28:02 <VRubezhny>	if we'll use YYYY.MM.DD as a version and then upstream decides to produce normal versions - it will collapse the updates for us (and we'll have to keep handling the versions in YYYY.MM.DD way)

Dec 01 04:52:46 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> When migrating from Eclipse 3.x to E4, should I start removing all the plugin dependencies from org.eclipse.ui * ?
Dec 01 04:54:33 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> I think that's a good start. Though you might not be able to get rid of everything depending on your plug-in's internals.
Dec 01 05:01:03 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> Thanks!
Dec 02 13:08:18 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> I develop using Eclipse Neon. How I can test that my plug-in works also on Eclipse Luna?
Dec 02 14:43:34 <eclipse-mm>	<patrickpol> change the target to Luna I think?
Dec 02 14:55:41 <nitind>	At the least, if you can't actually test it with Luna.
Dec 02 16:45:12 <eclipse-mm>	<jonah> You can't normally change target platform from Neon to Luna to test because you will more than likely find that you are using Binary compatible, but Source incompatible code. I normally do it by installing plug-ins in luna.
Dec 02 16:45:40 <eclipse-mm>	<jonah> A common place that goes wrong is the changed (source) signature of getAdapter.

Dec 12 11:58:06 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> Thanks !
Dec 12 12:00:00 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> krishna: I assume it could be because SWT uses native widgets

Jan 18 15:11:56 <nitind>	mistria: ?
Jan 18 16:44:21 <aza>	hi
Jan 18 16:44:21 <Arbalest>	Welcome! If you have a question, just ask, or take a look at our FAQ - http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ :) Try typing ~faq to see more FAQs! If you have errors or logs to show, see ~pastebin. If you have screenshots to share, see ~image. You need to describe your problem in detail,so  please provide some ~info about your setup. Don't ask to ask, just ask. You might also want to try http://mattermost.eclipse.org
Jan 18 16:44:42 <aza>	a question: if I open this page : http://git.eclipse.org/c/gerrit/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt.git/
Jan 18 16:44:52 <aza>	there is a link in the bottom:
Jan 18 16:44:59 <aza>	Clone: git clone https://git.eclipse.org/r/gerrit/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt
Jan 18 16:45:39 <aza>	problem is - it says : git repo is not found
Jan 18 16:45:58 <aza>	how to clone it?
Jan 18 16:53:03 <nitind>	"it" says? What's "it"?
Jan 18 16:54:23 <nitind>	aza: The "gerrit" segment is not supposed to be in there, I think.
Jan 18 16:54:33 <nitind>	Neither on the web page or git repo URL.
Jan 18 16:54:44 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> I'm surprised it says to clone Gerrit.
Jan 18 16:54:47 <aza>	"it" is anythin
Jan 18 16:54:55 <aza>	like browser or git clone
Jan 18 16:55:06 <aza>	the line above is "git clone"
Jan 18 16:55:12 <aza>	so "git clone" it is
Jan 18 16:55:12 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> oh, because, you are truly, using the gerrit link
Jan 18 16:55:18 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> https://git.eclipse.org/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt.git/
Jan 18 16:56:06 <aza>	eclipse-mm - did you try your link before sending?
Jan 18 16:56:06 <eclipse-mm>	Valid commands are: [users, help]
Jan 18 16:56:29 <aza>	it reports the same error
Jan 18 16:56:49 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> Did you open the link
Jan 18 16:56:51 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> or clone the link
Jan 18 16:57:25 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> don't clone the link, I gave you a web link to open in the browser
Jan 18 16:58:31 <aza>	at last! it works
Jan 18 16:58:34 <aza>	thanks!

Jan 20 06:38:10 <psuzzi>	Hi All! Is there anyone logging using ILog from an Eclipse E4 plug-in? How can I get an ILog instance, statically, in my (E4) Plug-in Activator?
Jan 20 06:56:03 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> You should ask your questions in the #eclipse IRC channel, not #eclipse-dev.

Skip the "meta-questions" like asking whether anyone uses X also as a precursor to check whether anyone can help you with a problem you have with X. Just ask the real question you have about X.

I've never developed a plugin for Eclipse before, But I would like to edit the ShellED plugin for Bash scripts. I'd like to the templates feature to the existing plugin. Can anyone help point me in the right direction? I appreciate any help

Apr 06 02:56:02 <jvava>	any idea,  urgent
Apr 06 04:50:47 <jvava>	could you please recommend me some resources for e4?
Apr 06 05:19:03 <mbooth>	jvava: Re your mylyn problem, is the missing plugin in your target platform? Worth checking. Re: e4 resources, I usually recommend Lars' tutorials at http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/eclipse.html
Apr 06 05:31:18 <jvava>	mbooth, mylyn problem solved, I import the binary package of mylyn into my development env, the compile error gone now.

Apr 06 05:33:08 <jvava>	I want contribute a menu to package plugin, but vogella give only old method, I just want to know if it is reasible to use e4 tech, which I thought better.

Apr 06 05:34:07 <jvava>	old method, I means it extend  extension, not an e4 way.

Apr 07 10:44:06 <Illia>	I tried to open a repo though http://git.eclipse.org/c/ but it didn't work. I was getting to the same page but URL was strange. It contained "SomeCustomInjectedHeader:injected_by_wvs". Looked like a security issue.
Apr 07 10:44:36 <Illia>	But it was one hour before. Looks like it is fixed now.

May 11 08:27:11 <loic_fejoz>	Hi there, I am a new committer for a Polarsys project. I am a bit lost in the Eclipse process. Is it the rigth place to ask for question?
May 11 08:27:38 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> I'm not totally sure how the channels here work
May 11 08:27:42 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> but doesn't hurt to try, fire away
May 11 08:27:52 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> and welcome to the Eclipse Community!
May 11 08:28:41 <loic_fejoz>	Thanks.
May 11 08:28:41 <loic_fejoz>	I am a new commiter in a Polarsys project. We have pass the first preliminary IP review.
May 11 08:28:41 <loic_fejoz>	In my understanding, we shall do our first commit but we do not know how we gain rights on the github project (become members?).
May 11 08:28:41 <loic_fejoz>	Could someone point which manual I should look at? I have read the "git contributing" one and the "Eclipse project book" but I does not clarify this point I think.
May 11 08:28:41 <loic_fejoz>	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=507985
May 11 08:28:41 <loic_fejoz>	https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13108
May 11 08:28:41 <loic_fejoz>	https://www.polarsys.org/projects/polarsys.time4sys
May 11 08:30:32 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> I think by default the Git repository you are supposed to use is git.eclipse.org.
May 11 08:30:50 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> Did your project lead and/or mentors discuss with the webmasters for authorization to use GitHub?
May 11 08:31:15 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> I see nothing named "polar" on GitHub.
May 11 08:31:23 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> https://github.com/eclipse?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=polar&type=&language=
May 11 08:31:34 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> So even if you have had authorization, your repository has not been created.
May 11 08:32:33 <loic_fejoz>	I am not sure. They have fill the polarsys description with github. The project already exists : https://github.com/polarsys/time4sys
May 11 08:33:53 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> Oh, I thought you were in the Eclipse organization.
May 11 08:33:57 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> I guess this is a separate thing.
May 11 08:34:19 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> You should reach out to your project leads / webmasters to get yourselves added to the project.
May 11 08:34:23 <loic_fejoz>	eclipse-mm: In my understanding polarsys is a working group of Eclipse...
May 11 08:34:23 <eclipse-mm>	Valid commands are: [users, help]
May 11 08:34:27 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> You want your GitHub ID setup correctly in (Eclipse) Portal.
May 11 08:34:29 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> Then they will add you to the org
May 11 08:34:39 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> at that point you should get an invitation in your email to accept the invitation (IIRC)
May 11 08:35:20 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> Summoning @droy
May 11 08:35:37 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> or not I guess...lol
May 11 08:35:37 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> "droy was mentioned, but they did not receive a notification because they do not belong to this channel"
May 11 08:35:47 <loic_fejoz>	my github id is alreay set so I need to reach a polarsys leads/webmasters? ok then will try to find that one.
May 11 08:35:54 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> yeah, try that
May 11 08:35:59 <loic_fejoz>	thanks
May 11 08:36:04 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> you should've gotten an invite anyway
May 11 08:36:32 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> my email subject was like this
May 11 08:36:33 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> "[GitHub] Eclipse Webmaster team has invited you to join the Eclipse Foundation organization"
May 11 08:36:47 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> So you should get something like that in your mail
May 11 08:36:49 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> then you'll get invited
May 11 08:36:51 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> er
May 11 08:36:53 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> that means, you got invited
May 11 08:37:04 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> and hopefully your Eclipse.org email is the same as your GitHub email
May 11 08:37:08 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> I don't know if that will cause issues or not
May 11 08:37:37 <loic_fejoz>	I will check.
May 11 08:37:50 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> :thumbsup:
May 11 08:38:00 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> Hope things work out for you (^^)/

May 23 23:19:37 <dato_>	Hi, just wondering if anyone has experience with setting up JSDT development environment with Oomph?
May 24 13:57:26 <eclipse-mm>	<nitind> @psuzzi was one of the principles on that, I think.
May 24 14:01:28 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> Yes, but at the moment the Oomph setup for JSDT isn't working.
May 24 14:02:43 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> Better: I think it wasn't working for Neon M6, because of a small glitch with Orbit repository.
May 24 14:04:20 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> dato: I will take a look at the JSDT oomph setup soon, meanwhile, I suggest you to take a look at the mattermost channel (https://mattermost.eclipse.org/eclipse/channels/developers-qa), so you can get updates even when your IRC client is off.
May 24 16:43:25 <eclipse-mm>	<nitind> IPZilla says "The Contribution Questionnaire has been moved to the portal. Please access it in its new location: http://portal.eclipse.org/" for anything that would create a new CQ. Anyone know where it is on there?
May 24 16:49:31 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> @nitind Where is what? https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/

May 26 13:08:32 <eclipse-mm>	<datoda> Hello, @psuzzi and @nitind. Thank you so much for your replies. I didn't get a reply while I was on IRC so I thought my question wasn't going to be answered. :) I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Patrik's reply to my Bugzilla entry and his pointer to this forum!
May 26 13:17:06 <eclipse-mm>	<datoda> @psuzzi, I found your nicely made YouTube videos regarding JSDT development environment setup to be very helpful. Alas, I am afraid the files (like the .psf file) referred in there are no longer available or things may have changed in the past few months, so I can't quite duplicate the environment for JSDT 3.8.2 as shown in the videos. I have also followed the steps in the wiki to no avail. In one situation, I c

Jun 01 00:00:40 <user__>	im trying to implement a hook that runs when a file is opened, when the file is opened I want to get some stats about it e.g. number of lines, and save it to a database
Jun 01 00:00:57 <user__>	im stuck at the first step (how to set up a hook that triggers when a file is opened)
Jun 01 00:01:18 <user__>	if this is not the right channel for the question do you guys know where I should ask?
Jun 01 00:23:17 <eclipse-mm>	<nitind> Why when it's opened?
Jun 01 00:25:29 <user__>	I am experimenting with the API (trying to learn something in the process). I can hook when its saved using an IResourceChangeListener and addResourceChangeListener but i cant find how to do it when it's opened
Jun 01 01:00:28 <eclipse-mm>	<nitind> There is no reliable way to do so, but most text files opened in the workspace should trigger an event to buffer listeners. See http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/core/filebuffers/IFileBufferManager.html#addFileBufferListener(org.eclipse.core.filebuffers.IFileBufferListener) and the FileBuffers facade in the same package.
Jun 01 01:01:23 <eclipse-mm>	<nitind> Well, nine reliable that I know of, but I've been out of the loop for a few years.
Jun 01 01:02:08 <eclipse-mm>	<nitind> Err, none.
Jun 01 01:12:36 <user__>	eclipse-mm, any idea what plugin i need to install to get org.eclipse.core.filebuffers?

Jun 18 16:50:38 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> If you're trying to just fix a bug, I'm not sure I would bother with building the entire Eclipse SDK.

Aug 30 10:52:02 <irrenhaus3>	hi everyone. I'm working on a plugin that needs to make changes to a StyledText widget associated with a currently opened text editor. But it seems that the default text editors don't expose these widgets (or maybe I just can't find the API point where they do?) and implementing an own text editor is a no-go. Is there anything I can do in that matter?
Aug 30 10:53:47 <irrenhaus3>	To be more specific, the widget modification I want to make is to change the background color of a given range of plain text; without disrupting syntax highlighting, but possibly disrupting preexisting highlights such as the java editor's "Override" annotation and bracket highlighting
Aug 30 10:54:13 <irrenhaus3>	and the API version I'm using is 4.6 Neon.

Oct 13 03:39:32 <akurtakov>	mistria: I insist on JLS9 due to bugs like https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/109959/
Oct 13 03:40:40 <mistria>	akurtakov: I'm 100% in favor of it, and I think your comment highlighted a good reason why JDT debugger may be suboptimal on hover
Oct 13 03:41:05 <akurtakov>	well, this would be very rare
Oct 13 03:41:36 <akurtakov>	as it could happen only in java 8 constrct which is not static
Oct 13 03:42:04 <akurtakov>	but IIRC all added in java 8 is lambda which is static so shouldn't happen :)
Oct 13 03:42:12 <akurtakov>	but better safe than sorry :)
Oct 13 03:44:03 <akurtakov>	java 9 private interface should trigger it though
Oct 13 03:46:09 <mistria>	akurtakov: I believe this static reference to JLS version should be replaced by something more dynamic, such as an AST.JLS_LATEST node, which should be updated whenever AST supports a new JLS version
Oct 13 03:47:07 <akurtakov>	that would make sense in many places

Oct 14 08:32:49 <john16384>	I already have an eclipse installer Eclipse running with the appropriate project that I've been using to step-through the code.
Oct 14 08:34:18 <john16384>	The bug is annoying to reproduce because it seems to be a race condition, that only fails when something that is done on the SWT thread (with getDisplay().asyncExec()) is happening slower than usual...

Dec 12 04:20:47 <Barnelid>	Hi, i stumbled across some unrelated cleanup stuff when trying to fix a bug in Eclipse tests. How would i go about submitting this? Do i attach it to the bug im working on, do i create a new bug or do i just commit it without attaching it to a bug?
Dec 12 04:43:31 <mbooth>	Barnelid: I would file a new bug and submit it through gerrit
Dec 12 04:44:12 <Barnelid>	mbooth: Thank you, i will do that.
Dec 12 14:02:59 <Harzilein>	hi

Dec 19 23:58:10 <cbarcenas>	Am hoping that somebody could confirm whether this is simply a accounts.eclipse.org<->gerrit synchronization issue, and if so how long I should wait until I'm able to log into Gerrit
Dec 20 00:13:58 <cbarcenas>	Ah, issue has resolved itself. Nevermind!

Jan 19 02:39:40 <mistria>	akurtakov: hi
Jan 19 02:40:27 <mistria>	akurtakov: about the p2 things, the scenario you asked me to try does work well (ie run new version of aggregator including new p2 against Oxygen.2 simrel and try to install it in Oxygen.2)
Jan 19 02:41:12 <mistria>	akurtakov: however, I don't have the impression the FeaturesAndBundles publisher is involved in this scenario, so I don't think it does test the bugfix properly
Jan 19 02:46:48 <akurtakov>	mistria: can you check content.xml how are brees represented
Jan 19 02:47:21 <akurtakov>	mistria: see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=528387
Jan 19 02:47:51 <akurtakov>	it's c16 that we look for being fixed
Jan 19 02:48:21 <akurtakov>	15 actually
Jan 19 03:21:04 <mistria>	So it's not the same scenario to test
Jan 19 03:21:34 <mistria>	that said, I looked at the content.xml generated by newer p2/aggregator from Oxygen metadata
Jan 19 03:22:58 <mistria>	and I don't see anything related to BREE ( I tried looking for `JavaSE` )

Feb 22 15:51:55 <mattrpav>	The use case is a list of Java packages being provided at runtime for a JAXBContext / JSON Object Marshaller to be instantiated and be ‘aware’ of the new bundle’s models

Feb 27 14:36:06 <Putti>	Hi, I was looking for ecj source code but I got none of the the source code zip/jar building out of the box. The place was this: http://archive.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/ and more especially http://archive.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/R-4.7.2-201711300510/download.php?dropFile=ecjsrc-4.7.2.jar
Feb 27 14:36:31 <Putti>	Is this the right place?
Feb 27 14:40:54 <Putti>	I finally got ecjsrc-4.6.3 building but had to tweak the build.xml like here is done: https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk/02-buildxml-fix-manifest.patch?h=packages/eclipse-ecj. Why does this tweaking need to be done? Do I build the thing wrongly, i.e. is "ant build" not enough?
Feb 28 07:59:58 <Putti>	Am I asking the build problem question I sent yesterday in the wrong channel?
Feb 28 09:37:25 <mbooth>	Putti: You were right first time, the canonical place from which to get ecj source is here: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/index.html
Feb 28 09:38:06 <mbooth>	Putti: The ant build sometimes doesn't work because it's not routinely exercised. The downloadable binaries are generated from the maven build.
Feb 28 14:49:30 <Putti>	mbooth, thanks for explaining! :) I'm afraid that I probably don't have enough time to work on making the ant builds work but I will try remember this in case I have a free time slot in the future.
Feb 28 14:49:57 <Putti>	I'm sure you do lots of interesting things within the Eclipse project umbrella :)
Feb 28 14:52:44 <mbooth>	Putti: :-) If it still does not work in the Photon stream (4.8.x) please file a bug with JDT: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=JDT
Feb 28 14:54:24 <Putti>	I think it didn't. I guess I can find enough time for reporting a bug!
Feb 28 15:00:45 <mbooth>	Putti: Thanks -- at least this way, it's visible that more than one person (me) is finding these problems :-)
Mar 01 10:52:40 <Putti>	How are the binary .rsc files in eclipse.jdt.core/org.eclipse.jdt.core/compiler/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/compiler/parser/ made?
Mar 01 10:52:58 <Putti>	are there scripts to make those from source?
Mar 01 10:58:45 <mbooth>	Putti: I suppose they are compiled from the grammer: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/tree/org.eclipse.jdt.core/grammar/java.g
Mar 01 11:00:02 <mbooth>	Putti: This page might be useful, or it might be obsolete: https://www.eclipse.org/jdt/core/howto/generate%20parser/generateParser.html
Mar 01 11:01:51 <Putti>	mbooth, I looked into those but I'm not sure all the unicode .rsc files come from there
Mar 01 11:04:09 <Putti>	btw: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=531860
Mar 01 14:57:34 <royal_screwup21>	I git cloned a project, then tried to open it on eclipse, which I did but all of the packages were splattered across my pacakge explorer. Instead of a having a main root project directory, I now have all of the sub directories of this project so I can't bundle up the project on the sidebar. How do I fix this?

I've recently started contributing to Eclipse and I found the topic "Apache Cassandra Client" under Eclipse Vert'x pretty interesting to work with. It would be great to know who can mentor the task for GSoC'18.

Mar 07 15:38:33 *	Channel #eclipse-dev url: http://eclipse.org
Mar 08 05:15:38 <ward>	Hello, I am trying to use things like Eclipse's ASTParser (org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.ASTParser) without having to run as a plugin and without Eclipse if needed. I figured this would be a matter of including the right libraries from maven. However:
Mar 08 05:16:02 <ward>	1. Most seem to be on the older side (several years). Are they just not updated very often or am I looking in the wrong place?
Mar 08 05:17:06 <ward>	2. Is there a list of which ones I need exactly? I have added a few so far (org.eclipse.jdt.core, org.eclipse.core.resources, some others from org.eclipse.core), but it does not quite seem to work.
Mar 08 05:18:30 <ward>	3. Specifically, I get an error about a missing split method in org.eclipse.core.runtime.SubMonitor, which leads me to assume maybe the libraries I included are not the correct ones or (since I am running things in Eclipse) I have included incorrect libraries and it is partially using the ones I included and partially the ones in Eclipse.
Mar 08 05:21:17 <mbooth>	ward: Except for the ECJ compiler, I'm not sure that JDT is really meant to be re-used outside of an OSGi context. What specifically do wish to accomplish?
Mar 08 05:22:15 <mbooth>	ward: BTW, the maven artifacts seem pretty up to date to me: https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.eclipse.jdt%22
Mar 08 05:24:22 <ward>	I... may be an idiot who used the wrong maven site. Google showed me "mvnrepository.com" so I was just using that for deciding version numbers. (Apologies, I only started playing around with Java 6ish months ago, though I feel I should have noticed this part by now)
Mar 08 05:24:30 <ward>	I will see if using up to date packages works better :P
Mar 08 05:25:18 <ward>	as for the purpose, I am in research and am trying to use a change distiller to compare two ast trees (i.e., it compares them and gives me a list of changes performed on the one to turn it into the other)
Mar 08 05:25:59 <ward>	the distiller I use was written to be used as an eclipse plugin (and building upon it through eclipse plugins), but if possible I would want to get rid of such a strong dependency
Mar 08 05:26:07 <ward>	if that makes sense
Mar 08 05:27:18 <ward>	I thought I had worked it out, since everything seemed to be working nicely on another setup, but as I was setting it up in a more recent Eclipse, errors started popping up, leading me to realise it did not quite yet work as I had hoped
Mar 08 05:29:08 <ward>	actually on second look, that has the same versions as the mvnrepository one (the ones that look like they may be out of date to me are those found here https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.eclipse.core%22 )
Mar 08 05:29:33 <ward>	which are the ones I was adding in order to (potentially) make things work
Mar 08 05:29:48 <mbooth>	ward: https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.eclipse.platform%22
Mar 08 05:30:25 <ward>	ah, I have been looking in the wrong group then
Mar 08 05:30:56 <mbooth>	ward: Do you know about tycho?
Mar 08 05:31:27 <mbooth>	It's much easier to build Eclipse plugins with tycho (rather than plain maven) because it comprehends OSGi dependencies.
Mar 08 05:32:04 <ward>	I did not know about tycho, I will look into it too, thank you
Mar 08 05:33:15 <mbooth>	ward: As usual, Lars has a decent tutorial for it: http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseTycho/article.html
Mar 09 10:14:26 <ward>	as a follow up: I think there were issues with the way the project I depended on co-existed in the workspace and how it was set up. I gutted out that other project to remove all eclipse plugin relations in it and turned it into a maven project to streamline its dependencies. Once that was done I could more easily depend on it in my own project.
Mar 09 10:15:12 <ward>	So the flaw was not at how my project was doing dependencies to jdt.core, but how the changedistiller project I relied on was set up
Mar 09 10:15:59 <ward>	since after all that cleaning up, I could use ASTParser just by having the jdt.core library as a maven dependency

Mar 15 12:11:10 <fabio_livingsilv>	hello, it's me again
Mar 15 12:11:57 <fabio_livingsilv>	why does the platform aggregator build every other arch even if I specify -Dnative=gtk.linux.x86_64 ?
Mar 15 12:12:13 <fabio_livingsilv>	do I have to nuke the other archs from the .pom's?
Mar 15 12:16:59 <fabio_livingsilv>	also, can you link me the sources of Fedora's maven macros? I can't truly understand what %pom_disable_module and others do
Mar 15 13:44:25 <fabio_livingsilv>	akurtakov, can you tell me how to disable unneeded architectures?
Mar 15 14:52:23 <akurtakov>	fabio_livingsilv: -Dnative only forces rebuild of the natives
Mar 15 14:52:34 <akurtakov>	the way eclipse builds is producing all archs in one go
Mar 15 14:52:56 <akurtakov>	as all of them share the same p2 repo and thus qualiefier
Mar 15 14:53:22 <akurtakov>	fabio_livingsilv: fedoar srpm has patches to removed unneeded archs from feature.xmls
Mar 15 14:54:01 <akurtakov>	and pom_disable_module pretty much removes <module>xxxx</module> line from the respective pom.xml file
Mar 15 15:48:37 <fabio_livingsilv>	Ok, thanks. I'll see what I can do :)
Mar 15 16:58:13 <fabio_livingsilv>	sorry to bother you but got another problem: I 've cloned platform aggregator repository recursively, and then done `git checkout tags/R4_7_3 --recurse-submodules` and run `mvn clean verify -DskipTests=true -Dnative=gtk.linux.x86_64` to build.
Mar 15 16:58:16 <fabio_livingsilv>	got this error:
Mar 15 16:58:54 <fabio_livingsilv>	org.apache.maven.InternalErrorException: Internal error: java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not resolve target platform specification artifact org.eclipse:eclipse-sdk-prereqs:target:4.7.3-SNAPSHOT with stacktrace enabled, building eclipse-junit-tests
Mar 15 16:59:38 <fabio_livingsilv>	I haven't touched any files
Mar 15 17:24:05 <akurtakov>	fabio_livingsilv: disable eclipse-junit-tests - this is a weird module for running tests post build @eclipse.org infra
Mar 15 17:25:20 <fabio_livingsilv>	oh, wow. I wish it was documented :( thanks again for your help, you're very kind
Mar 15 17:25:59 <akurtakov>	fabio_livingsilv: I wish I find time to fix these things proper
Mar 15 17:26:08 <akurtakov>	but there is always smth else
Mar 15 17:26:30 <akurtakov>	and usually the things for which there is biggest number of people complaining win
Mar 15 17:26:41 <akurtakov>	this one is not amongst them - you're the first actually
Mar 15 17:27:27 <akurtakov>	with that g'night - almost midnight for me
Mar 15 17:27:28 <fabio_livingsilv>	Because no one tries to compile eclipse from source I suppose. Even Arch packages eclipse from blobs ahaha
Mar 15 17:27:39 <fabio_livingsilv>	Yup, see you akurtakov :)

Mar 21 10:56:34 <livingsilver94>	hello guys, it's me again. I've successfully built eclipse-platform on Solus, disabling unneded platforms too by mimicking what Fedora does. Now, how can I build the JDT?
Mar 21 10:56:44 <livingsilver94>	I posted the question here, too: https://www.reddit.com/r/eclipse/comments/85555r/how_to_build_eclipsejdt_from_source/
Mar 21 10:57:21 <mbooth>	JDT and PDE are built as part of the platform build, no?
Mar 21 10:57:32 <mbooth>	livingsilver94: Are you building the aggregator repo?
Mar 21 10:58:05 <livingsilver94>	mbooth, yes, I am building it. TBH launching eclipse in the target directory I have no possibility to configure/create a Java project
Mar 21 10:59:09 <mbooth>	livingsilver94: Which target directory? :-)
Mar 21 10:59:17 <livingsilver94>	errr wait a sec
Mar 21 10:59:46 <livingsilver94>	eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator/eclipse.platform.releng.tychoeclipsebuilder/platform/target
Mar 21 11:02:28 <mbooth>	livingsilver94: There's your problem -- the platform product is the platform only
Mar 21 11:02:45 <mbooth>	livingsilver94: The sdk product has the JDT and PDE bundled with the platform
Mar 21 11:03:32 <mbooth>	I.e.: eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator/eclipse.platform.releng.tychoeclipsebuilder/*sdk*/target
Mar 21 11:04:14 <livingsilver94>	then why does Fedora disable it? https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/eclipse/blob/master/f/eclipse.spec#_455
Mar 21 11:04:34 <mbooth>	livingsilver94: Because we ship JDT and PDE as separate RPMs
Mar 21 11:04:42 <mbooth>	That you can install later
Mar 21 11:05:34 <livingsilver94>	I see. Then it must act different from Solus. In Solus, big packages are built in a single time, and then we split them in smaller packages with filepath patterns
Mar 21 11:05:47 <livingsilver94>	Ok then, I'll build the sdk :D
Mar 21 11:06:25 <mbooth>	livingsilver94: Oof, doing it like that might break your Eclipse install :-o
Mar 21 11:07:32 <mbooth>	(I.e.: p2 metadata in the platform will say plugins are present when they are not -- I don't know how that will affect things)
Mar 21 11:07:39 <livingsilver94>	can't i build the jdt alone then?
Mar 21 11:08:13 <mbooth>	You already built JDT
Mar 21 11:09:25 <livingsilver94>	true, I didn't explain well. I mean, what's the correct directory structure to put jdt blobs in, if I build it separatedly from the platform?
Mar 21 11:10:00 <livingsilver94>	Fedora has droplets and other things in the jft rpm
Mar 21 11:10:00 <mbooth>	livingsilver94: For packaging plugins separately there is a mechanism called "droplets"
Mar 21 11:10:32 <mbooth>	(Or even simpler, but deprecated, "dropins")
Mar 21 11:10:40 <livingsilver94>	is there a tutorial for that? I'm gonna waste your time by learning new things :)
Mar 21 11:10:44 <livingsilver94>	not gonna*
Mar 21 11:13:40 <mbooth>	livingsilver94: Let me check, in Fedora our special maven tooling does it for us
Mar 21 11:14:11 <livingsilver94>	yup that's something I've figured out. You have plenty of maven macros
Mar 21 11:16:09 <mbooth>	livingsilver94: Here's an example where I manually create a droplet from a normal p2 repo: https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/rpm/devstudio.spec.template#L67
Mar 21 11:18:00 <livingsilver94>	are you using eclipse itself to create a droplet?
Mar 21 11:18:11 <mbooth>	erm yes
Mar 21 11:18:49 <mbooth>	But you can bootstrap it into your distro by building the platform only first
Mar 21 11:19:24 <livingsilver94>	ok, if the bare platform can do this then I'm fine
Mar 21 11:20:33 <livingsilver94>	OK then. I'll give it a try, but first i'll have to remove all the equinox thingy from the platform. I'll copy Fedora again
Mar 21 11:21:31 <livingsilver94>	thanks thousands time mbooth, really :) I'll roam around again If i need help, or to report you my success :)
Mar 21 11:21:47 <livingsilver94>	times*
Mar 21 11:25:27 <livingsilver94>	ah no, one last question: what's the correct jdt repository? *.jdt.core or *.jdt alone?
Mar 21 11:27:50 <mbooth>	livingsilver94: You mean in the aggregater? There's like 5 jdt repos
Mar 21 11:28:30 <mbooth>	FWIW, here's a document about the droplet mechanism, I guess it's called "p2 fragments" under the hood: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/P2_Fragments
Mar 21 11:30:48 <livingsilver94>	LOL even the wiki is confessing that creating fragments is not easy. Anyways, here: `-source <path to source repo>`
Mar 21 11:31:10 <livingsilver94>	what's the correct repo? all of the jdt on just one of these directories?
Mar 21 11:35:04 <mbooth>	JDT is split across several repos: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/
Mar 21 11:39:50 <livingsilver94>	Ok, i'll see what's easiest to do, between sdk and fragments
Mar 21 11:40:41 <mbooth>	livingsilver94: You already built all the jdt bundles and features when you built the platform, you Simply™ have to turn those into a droplet
Mar 21 11:42:21 <livingsilver94>	heh, that's the fun part! that trademark is so well placed :P
Mar 21 11:45:24 <mbooth>	livingsilver94: I think I might have been answering the wrong question: For "-source <path to source repo>" this is talking about a p2 repo
Mar 21 11:45:42 <mbooth>	Not a git repo
Mar 21 11:45:49 <mbooth>	Sorry for the confusion
Mar 21 11:46:12 <livingsilver94>	FIY I don't know (yet?) what p2 is, that's why i didn't catch your mistake
Mar 21 11:46:19 <livingsilver94>	no problem
