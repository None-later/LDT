Aug 11 01:25:07 <luxigo>	Ok now we have a dark theme after ten years.... but why is it still so much a pain in the sas to darken the background more (I mean to black) and not only the editor window ?  (It's not a question, its an exasperated sigh...)
Aug 11 01:26:34 <luxigo>	a slider for darken/lighten the background would be nice :-)
Aug 11 01:26:42 <luxigo>	brighten :-)
Aug 11 02:18:25 <nitind>	I sometimes wonder if people just never turn down their screen brightness.
