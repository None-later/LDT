Aug 11 01:25:07 <luxigo>	Ok now we have a dark theme after ten years.... but why is it still so much a pain in the sas to darken the background more (I mean to black) and not only the editor window ?  (It's not a question, its an exasperated sigh...)
Aug 11 01:26:34 <luxigo>	a slider for darken/lighten the background would be nice :-)
Aug 11 01:26:42 <luxigo>	brighten :-)
Aug 11 02:18:25 <nitind>	I sometimes wonder if people just never turn down their screen brightness.

Sep 07 03:46:39 <psuzzi>	Hi! I'm implementing search in Workspace from QuickAcces, and I've a question on using performTextSearchWorkingSet.
Sep 07 03:46:45 <psuzzi>	In Bug 500833 - [QuickAccess] Allow Text search, I added a new quickaccess entry to launch the search in workspace, and I can launch the search in workspace, but I'm not able to pass the "text to search" to the command.
Sep 07 03:46:52 <psuzzi>	I know the ID of the command: "org.eclipse.search.ui.performTextSearchWorkingSet", and I can invoke it, but I can not pass the search text, as the command takes the search text from the current selection.
Sep 07 03:46:58 <psuzzi>	So, the questions is: does anybody knows how to pass the search text to the command performTextSearchWorkingSet ?
Sep 07 03:47:03 <psuzzi>	Current code in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500833#c5,
Sep 07 03:47:03 <psuzzi>	(from change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/80483/5/ )
Sep 07 03:48:50 <psuzzi>	pardon me, the Command ID is: org.eclipse.search.ui.performTextSearchWorkspace

Sep 07 14:00:27 <vastu5996>	hi, i am new to eclipse development, recently i am encountering this error while cloning eclipse projects :
Sep 07 14:00:33 <vastu5996>	premature EOF
Sep 07 14:00:48 <vastu5996>	index-failed
Sep 07 14:01:37 <vastu5996>	What might be the possible reasons and solutions for this issue?
Sep 09 07:02:11 <psuzzi>	I have a file resource loaded from an InputSource/InputStream.
Sep 09 07:02:12 <psuzzi>	How can I get the bundle-Id for the bundle containing that resource?
Sep 09 12:50:35 <nitind>	psuzzi: If you only have an input stream, that information has been lost.
Sep 09 12:50:54 <psuzzi>	nitind: thanks!
Sep 09 13:01:06 <psuzzi>	actually I had a org.w3c.css.sac.InputSource, but I think that is the same.
Sep 09 13:41:12 <nitind>	That might have the original URI in it. Depends on how the InputSource was instantiated.

Sep 16 08:49:49 <mistria>	psuzzi: apparently it was ;)

Sep 16 08:50:22 <mistria>	psuzzi: I don't remember the warning neither...
Sep 16 08:51:28 <psuzzi>	mistria: same for me, I think it will be good having a place where to check to see if the master is closed
Sep 16 08:52:05 <mistria>	psuzzi: or better, find a way to not require master to close

Oct 04 09:28:42 <gaccounts>	Looking at https://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/Eclipse_Build, would you say that's an up to date instruction for building from source?
Oct 04 09:30:42 <gaccounts>	Hmm, it points to http://download.eclipse.org/technology/linuxtools/eclipse-build/ which does not have any links to 4.4 (or later)
Oct 04 09:31:07 <mbooth>	gaccounts: No, CBI project took over, so a more accurate document is probably this one: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform-releng/Platform_Build
Oct 04 09:31:50 <mbooth>	(I.e. maven build)
Oct 04 09:31:56 <gaccounts>	mbooth, ok thanks.  Ultimately what I wanted first was to get a complete corresponding source code of a known build for example one of the downloadable distros like -DSL
Oct 04 09:32:23 <gaccounts>	I imagine following the instructions for building is the first step...   or are there actually corresponding source bundles downloadable (I can't seem to find them on typical mirrors)
Oct 04 09:32:53 <gaccounts>	^^ distros meaning a particular downloadable Eclipse variant
Oct 04 09:33:44 <mbooth>	gaccounts: For the Eclipse platform, sources that comprise a release have well-known tags. For example, Eclipse Platform Neon.1 is: http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator.git/tag/?h=R4_6_1
Oct 04 09:35:51 <gaccounts>	ok, but then I guess I should follow some build instructions to recursively acquire all the relevant packages that are part of something like the -DSL release right?
Oct 04 09:36:23 <gaccounts>	I mean all parts won't all be in the same git repo I imagine.
Oct 04 09:37:43 <mbooth>	gaccounts: Of course, follow the directions in the doc I posted to build the platform -- the other constituent parts of a "distro" are different projects
Oct 04 09:38:25 <gaccounts>	got it, I'll try the build instructions and see where that takes me.   I'm correct in that there are no source bundles that make up everything corresponding to a "distro" (wrong word probably but you know what I mean)
Oct 04 09:38:38 <gaccounts>	^^ that's correct right?
Oct 04 09:39:21 <mbooth>	Right. In general, the products that are available for download are made up of the base Eclipse platform plus a whole host of other projects that participate in the release
Oct 04 09:40:26 <mbooth>	gaccounts: See here for all the git repos for all the eclipse.org projects (there are many): http://git.eclipse.org/c/
Oct 04 09:41:10 <gaccounts>	OK redistribution of such combined products is a little tricky from license perspective if you have to distribute (or offer) all the corresponding source code.
Oct 04 09:41:39 <gaccounts>	it seems the Eclipse project itself does not really do that with the distributed bundles (at least not in an easy to understand way?)
Oct 04 09:42:22 <mbooth>	gaccounts: What do you mean, from a license perspective? All eclipse.org code should be EPL, no?
Oct 04 09:42:28 <gaccounts>	right
Oct 04 09:42:45 <gaccounts>	and epl requires you to offer the source code to whomever you distribute to, agreed?
Oct 04 09:42:52 <gaccounts>	so you need to know what that source code is
Oct 04 09:43:13 <gaccounts>	unless I've misunderstood the license...
Oct 04 09:43:58 <mbooth>	gaccounts: All the source is there...
Oct 04 09:44:06 <gaccounts>	"there"? where?
Oct 04 09:44:27 <gaccounts>	that's what I meant with "in an easy to understand way"
Oct 04 09:44:42 <gaccounts>	I am sure all the source is available and can be figured out.
Oct 04 09:45:45 <gaccounts>	I think we're in agreement.  I'll start with a maven build, since it must pull down all the relevant source so that's the answer I think...
Oct 04 09:46:57 <gaccounts>	mbooth, thanks for your help by the way
Oct 04 09:48:19 <mbooth>	Sure
Oct 04 09:49:27 <mbooth>	gaccounts: Here is the repo that contains the product definitions for the "distros": http://git.eclipse.org/c/epp/org.eclipse.epp.packages.git/tree/packages/
Oct 04 09:50:25 <gaccounts>	ah ok, so something like  package.dsl.product would be the dsl version of eclipse?
Oct 04 09:50:33 <gaccounts>	s/be/define/
Oct 04 09:51:12 <mbooth>	Yeah. But again, you will see that the eclipse platform is only one part of the product.
Oct 04 09:51:28 <gaccounts>	ok
Oct 04 10:13:07 <nitind>	Check the manifest in each plug-in. There should be a source reference to the original CVS or git repo for most modern builds.
Oct 04 15:21:00 <rawbdor>	anyone here know how ot build wtp stuff?  i just get non-resolvable parent pom
Oct 04 15:21:15 <rawbdor>	[ERROR]     Non-resolvable parent POM: Failure to find org.eclipse:wtp-parent:pom:3.6.0-SNAPSHOT in https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of jboss-snapshots-repository has elapsed or updates are forced and 'parent.relativePath' points at wrong local POM @ line 17, column 11 -> [Help 2]
Oct 04 15:39:25 <nitind>	From where are you starting, and what's with the jboss.org?
Oct 04 15:51:01 <rawbdor>	nitind,   i have ssh://rstryker@git.eclipse.org/gitroot/jeetools/webtools.javaee.git (fetch)   cloned basically
Oct 04 15:51:11 <rawbdor>	no idea why it's looking exclusively in jboss.org
Oct 04 15:51:17 <rawbdor>	its probably part of my default settings.xml for maven
Oct 04 15:52:44 <nitind>	Usually I'd say to look at what the hudson invocation is (https://hudson.eclipse.org/webtools/job/javaee-gerrit/lastBuild/consoleFull). A full WTP build usually starts with the aggregator repo, right?

Oct 04 16:02:37 <rawbdor>	but thats not working
Oct 04 16:02:42 <nitind>	What happens instead?
Oct 04 16:04:01 <rawbdor>	same problem
Oct 04 16:04:03 <rawbdor>	basically cant find parent pom

Oct 04 16:04:14 <rawbdor>	my local settings.xml has several repos etc
Oct 04 16:04:20 <rawbdor>	but i dont have any eclipse or wtp ones
Oct 04 16:05:41 <rgrunber>	rawbdor: what happens if you add '-U' to the maven call
Oct 04 16:06:21 <rgrunber>	hmm nvm..
Oct 04 16:06:27 <rgrunber>	there is no wtp-parent in that repo..
Oct 04 16:08:04 <rawbdor>	yeah :|
Oct 04 16:08:08 <rawbdor>	for now im using gerrit
Oct 04 16:08:13 <rawbdor>	as my build system =P
Oct 04 16:08:17 <rawbdor>	feel kinda bad about it tho
Oct 04 16:08:19 <rgrunber>	so that relative path means it's actually there .. so it's expecting to find it on the path.

Oct 25 14:01:44 <epatpol>	but how do I configure my plugin to fetch its dependencies from another maven repository, is it possible?

Oct 26 10:21:07 <rgrunber>	is download.eclipse.org non-responsive for anyone else ? (it's there.. just not really responding over http)
Oct 26 10:22:09 <rgrunber>	seems back up.. nvm
Oct 26 11:35:43 <epatpol>	I'm still stuck on this, how do I include an external jar to an eclipse plug-in? It's not on orbit or in an update site
Oct 26 11:38:34 <mbooth>	epatpol: You can tell tycho to consider normal maven pom dependencies as part of the target platform: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform#.22POM_dependencies_consider.22
Oct 26 11:42:16 <epatpol>	thanks mbooth, I'll see if that works!
Oct 26 15:02:56 <epatpol>	I'm just trying to add an external jar to a sample plug-in that has no pom yet (generated from eclipse->new project)
Oct 26 15:03:17 <epatpol>	adding it to the classpath via the plugin.xml seems to break everything
Oct 26 15:03:39 <epatpol>	I'm not very familiar with tycho so it's all very confusing to me
Oct 26 15:10:05 <Smasher>	what is an external jar? a bundle? a plugin? a feature?
Oct 26 15:11:09 <Smasher>	if its a non-osgi jar you need either to wrap it or to embed it to your plugin
Oct 26 15:20:29 <epatpol>	yes, a non-osgi jar
Oct 26 15:20:59 <epatpol>	I discovered that from vogella https://github.com/reficio/p2-maven-plugin
Oct 26 15:21:29 <epatpol>	and I managed to make an update site from those jars
Oct 26 15:22:14 <epatpol>	but if you know how to "embed" the jar in the plugin
Oct 26 15:22:20 <epatpol>	that could be helpful also!
Oct 26 15:22:23 <epatpol>	and maybe less tedious
Oct 26 15:29:03 <nitind>	You are at least exploring the Plug-in Manifest Editor, right?
Oct 26 15:30:06 <epatpol>	yes
Oct 26 15:30:17 <Smasher>	epatpol well, you need to pack the jar into your plugin and add it to the Bundle-Classpath in your Manifest.mf
Oct 26 15:30:58 <Smasher>	yourjar.jar!/embedded.jar -> Bundle-Classpath: ., embedded.jar
Oct 26 15:31:02 <Smasher>	"." is important
Oct 26 15:31:52 <epatpol>	it may sound like a dumb question but why is the "." important, I noticed it automatically added it when using the classpath->add button to my jar
Oct 26 15:37:45 <Smasher>	there's only those objects on the classpath which you declare in that header
Oct 26 15:37:59 <Smasher>	lol, if the root of your jar is not on the classpath, then there's no folders inside you are on the classpath
Oct 26 15:39:29 <epatpol>	hmmmm
Oct 26 15:49:33 <epatpol>	yea it seems to work so far Smasher, thanks!
Oct 26 15:50:22 <Smasher>	np ;)
Oct 26 15:50:23 <epatpol>	does anyone know why some plugin projects have plugin.xml and some others don't?
Oct 26 15:53:02 <Smasher>	not sure but may be you mixup plugins with features?
Oct 26 15:55:32 <Smasher>	or plugins with a simple osgi-bundles without extension points?
Oct 26 15:58:12 <epatpol>	I just generated a new plug-in project with the default eclipse code and it generated a plugin.xml, however, when I look at other existing plug-in project, say a mylyn connector that has a xxxx.core plugin or xxxxx.ui plugin
Oct 26 15:58:18 <epatpol>	both of them don't have plugin.xml files
Oct 26 15:59:05 <epatpol>	but when I open the manifest file in their respective META-INF, it opens up the same editor as if I was opening the plugin.xml
Oct 26 15:59:08 <epatpol>	that is a bit confusing
Oct 26 16:03:08 <epatpol>	I should read up on osgi I guess
Oct 26 16:30:16 <Smasher>	there is onlz one such editor, which edits mainfest files
Oct 26 16:30:41 <Smasher>	the plugin manifest editor
Oct 26 16:30:49 <Smasher>	it is used for MANIFEST.MF, plugin.xml, fragment.xml and build.properties
Oct 26 16:30:55 <Smasher>	no matter if one of them is missing
Oct 26 16:32:14 <Smasher>	regading your another question: there is a plugin.xml in mylyn commons core org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.core_3.20.0.v20160421-1819.jar\plugin.xml
Oct 26 16:33:18 <Smasher>	jars without plugin.xml are no plugins but just osgi-bundles providing some byte code for another components
Oct 26 16:39:31 <Smasher>	epatpol plugins are extension points consumer or provider.. if there's no plugin.xml there's no connection to any extention point, therefore this is not a plugin

Nov 10 14:32:01 <gercan>	rgrunber: looking for the Orbit king
Nov 10 14:37:54 <rgrunber>	gercan: hey :P
Nov 10 14:38:15 <rgrunber>	gercan: is this about clojure ?
Nov 10 14:38:31 <rgrunber>	*google closure
Nov 10 14:38:40 <gercan>	yes
Nov 10 14:39:22 <gercan>	rgrunber: we had some trobule with it
Nov 10 14:39:46 <gercan>	rgrunber: google does not have versions on that package
Nov 10 14:40:07 <gercan>	http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.google.javascript%22%20AND%20a%3A%22closure-compiler%22
Nov 10 14:40:54 <gercan>	rgrunber: they are of form vYYYYMMDD so EBR generates a 0.0.0 version bundle
Nov 10 14:42:37 <rgrunber>	gercan: is there a standard for osgi-ifying bundles whose upstream specify no versioning.
Nov 10 14:43:10 <gercan>	rgrunber: I am not aware of any...
Nov 10 14:43:31 <gercan>	rgrunber: of course 0.0.0 makes it hard to reference
Nov 10 14:43:37 <rgrunber>	i'm thinking if 0.0.0 would be fine and just have the qualifier match their version..
Nov 10 14:43:43 <rgrunber>	yeah..
Nov 10 14:44:19 <gercan>	if/when we generate a new one with a new version it will just be 0.0.0
Nov 10 14:44:58 <akurtakov>	go for version YYYYMMDD ?
Nov 10 14:45:08 <rgrunber>	or something like 0.0.YYYMMDD ..
Nov 10 14:46:20 <gercan>	0.0.YYYMMDD better perhaps... In case they suddenly decide to put version numbers :)
Nov 10 14:46:59 <rgrunber>	on the other hand it is wrong in terms of what that usually means at eclipse (security fix).
Nov 10 14:48:46 <rgrunber>	how does maven handle 'v20161024' vs say a proper version.
Nov 10 14:51:10 <gercan>	maven versions are not like OSGis, they are exact
Nov 10 14:53:13 <rgrunber>	ah yah good call.
Nov 10 14:56:17 <gercan>	rgrunber: we could file an issue to the project to correct it but that will not happen quickly
Nov 10 14:56:20 <gercan>	if ever
Nov 10 14:56:31 <rgrunber>	gercan: haven't really looked into it but could you just always set the build qualifier rather than taking what timestamp maven gives you ?
Nov 10 14:57:33 <gercan>	rgrunber: set where?
Nov 10 14:59:38 <rgrunber>	tycho-packaging-plugin takes 'format' for build timestamp.
Nov 10 15:01:50 <gercan>	rgrunber: I am concerned that p2 may not handle dependencues correctly without the 3 piece version number in place
Nov 10 15:04:08 <rgrunber>	gercan: it should.. looking at OSGiVersion in p2.metadata if 2 things are compared and identical, it does a compare on the qualifiers.
Nov 10 15:06:34 <rgrunber>	ugh.. yeah i see your point.. i'd have to look into p2 and see it doesn't do something weird anywhere like just ignore qualifiers altogether..
Nov 10 15:09:13 <rgrunber>	gercan: in that case i'd go with 0.0.YYYYMMDD .. for now and maybe see later what versioning plans upstream has.
Nov 10 15:19:57 <gercan>	rgrunber: ok thanks
Nov 10 15:20:30 <gercan>	rgrunber: I am also confused about the contact information on ip_log.xml
Nov 10 15:21:12 <gercan>	rgrunber: whose contact are those? Upstream projects or just me as the repackager?
Nov 10 15:21:41 <rgrunber>	gercan: the packager (you).. they'll show up on pages like http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops/R20160520211859/ so it can be seen who packaged what.
Nov 10 15:23:30 <gercan>	rgrunber: this was really helpful your highness thanks
Nov 10 15:24:54 <rgrunber>	gercan: well sorry i couldn't give a clearer answer on the versioning. first time i run into such case in Eclipse land. youtube-dl does a YYYY-MM-DD format but i'm pretty sure they have no intention of doing more conventional versioning.
Nov 10 15:28:02 <VRubezhny>	if we'll use YYYY.MM.DD as a version and then upstream decides to produce normal versions - it will collapse the updates for us (and we'll have to keep handling the versions in YYYY.MM.DD way)

Dec 01 04:52:46 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> When migrating from Eclipse 3.x to E4, should I start removing all the plugin dependencies from org.eclipse.ui * ?
Dec 01 04:54:33 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> I think that's a good start. Though you might not be able to get rid of everything depending on your plug-in's internals.
Dec 01 05:01:03 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> Thanks!
Dec 02 13:08:18 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> I develop using Eclipse Neon. How I can test that my plug-in works also on Eclipse Luna?
Dec 02 14:43:34 <eclipse-mm>	<patrickpol> change the target to Luna I think?
Dec 02 14:55:41 <nitind>	At the least, if you can't actually test it with Luna.
Dec 02 16:45:12 <eclipse-mm>	<jonah> You can't normally change target platform from Neon to Luna to test because you will more than likely find that you are using Binary compatible, but Source incompatible code. I normally do it by installing plug-ins in luna.
Dec 02 16:45:40 <eclipse-mm>	<jonah> A common place that goes wrong is the changed (source) signature of getAdapter.

Dec 12 11:58:06 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> Thanks !
Dec 12 12:00:00 <eclipse-mm>	<psuzzi> krishna: I assume it could be because SWT uses native widgets

Jan 18 15:11:56 <nitind>	mistria: ?
Jan 18 16:44:21 <aza>	hi
Jan 18 16:44:21 <Arbalest>	Welcome! If you have a question, just ask, or take a look at our FAQ - http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ :) Try typing ~faq to see more FAQs! If you have errors or logs to show, see ~pastebin. If you have screenshots to share, see ~image. You need to describe your problem in detail,so  please provide some ~info about your setup. Don't ask to ask, just ask. You might also want to try http://mattermost.eclipse.org
Jan 18 16:44:42 <aza>	a question: if I open this page : http://git.eclipse.org/c/gerrit/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt.git/
Jan 18 16:44:52 <aza>	there is a link in the bottom:
Jan 18 16:44:59 <aza>	Clone: git clone https://git.eclipse.org/r/gerrit/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt
Jan 18 16:45:39 <aza>	problem is - it says : git repo is not found
Jan 18 16:45:58 <aza>	how to clone it?
Jan 18 16:53:03 <nitind>	"it" says? What's "it"?
Jan 18 16:54:23 <nitind>	aza: The "gerrit" segment is not supposed to be in there, I think.
Jan 18 16:54:33 <nitind>	Neither on the web page or git repo URL.
Jan 18 16:54:44 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> I'm surprised it says to clone Gerrit.
Jan 18 16:54:47 <aza>	"it" is anythin
Jan 18 16:54:55 <aza>	like browser or git clone
Jan 18 16:55:06 <aza>	the line above is "git clone"
Jan 18 16:55:12 <aza>	so "git clone" it is
Jan 18 16:55:12 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> oh, because, you are truly, using the gerrit link
Jan 18 16:55:18 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> https://git.eclipse.org/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt.git/
Jan 18 16:56:06 <aza>	eclipse-mm - did you try your link before sending?
Jan 18 16:56:06 <eclipse-mm>	Valid commands are: [users, help]
Jan 18 16:56:29 <aza>	it reports the same error
Jan 18 16:56:49 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> Did you open the link
Jan 18 16:56:51 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> or clone the link
Jan 18 16:57:25 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> don't clone the link, I gave you a web link to open in the browser
Jan 18 16:58:31 <aza>	at last! it works
Jan 18 16:58:34 <aza>	thanks!

Jan 20 06:38:10 <psuzzi>	Hi All! Is there anyone logging using ILog from an Eclipse E4 plug-in? How can I get an ILog instance, statically, in my (E4) Plug-in Activator?
Jan 20 06:56:03 <eclipse-mm>	<rcjsuen> You should ask your questions in the #eclipse IRC channel, not #eclipse-dev.

Skip the "meta-questions" like asking whether anyone uses X also as a precursor to check whether anyone can help you with a problem you have with X. Just ask the real question you have about X.

I've never developed a plugin for Eclipse before, But I would like to edit the ShellED plugin for Bash scripts. I'd like to the templates feature to the existing plugin. Can anyone help point me in the right direction? I appreciate any help

Apr 06 02:56:02 <jvava>	any idea,  urgent
Apr 06 04:50:47 <jvava>	could you please recommend me some resources for e4?
Apr 06 05:19:03 <mbooth>	jvava: Re your mylyn problem, is the missing plugin in your target platform? Worth checking. Re: e4 resources, I usually recommend Lars' tutorials at http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/eclipse.html
Apr 06 05:31:18 <jvava>	mbooth, mylyn problem solved, I import the binary package of mylyn into my development env, the compile error gone now.

Apr 06 05:33:08 <jvava>	I want contribute a menu to package plugin, but vogella give only old method, I just want to know if it is reasible to use e4 tech, which I thought better.

Apr 06 05:34:07 <jvava>	old method, I means it extend  extension, not an e4 way.

Apr 07 10:44:06 <Illia>	I tried to open a repo though http://git.eclipse.org/c/ but it didn't work. I was getting to the same page but URL was strange. It contained "SomeCustomInjectedHeader:injected_by_wvs". Looked like a security issue.
Apr 07 10:44:36 <Illia>	But it was one hour before. Looks like it is fixed now.
