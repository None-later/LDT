Aug 11 01:25:07 <luxigo>	Ok now we have a dark theme after ten years.... but why is it still so much a pain in the sas to darken the background more (I mean to black) and not only the editor window ?  (It's not a question, its an exasperated sigh...)
Aug 11 01:26:34 <luxigo>	a slider for darken/lighten the background would be nice :-)
Aug 11 01:26:42 <luxigo>	brighten :-)
Aug 11 02:18:25 <nitind>	I sometimes wonder if people just never turn down their screen brightness.

Sep 07 03:46:39 <psuzzi>	Hi! I'm implementing search in Workspace from QuickAcces, and I've a question on using performTextSearchWorkingSet.
Sep 07 03:46:45 <psuzzi>	In Bug 500833 - [QuickAccess] Allow Text search, I added a new quickaccess entry to launch the search in workspace, and I can launch the search in workspace, but I'm not able to pass the "text to search" to the command.
Sep 07 03:46:52 <psuzzi>	I know the ID of the command: "org.eclipse.search.ui.performTextSearchWorkingSet", and I can invoke it, but I can not pass the search text, as the command takes the search text from the current selection.
Sep 07 03:46:58 <psuzzi>	So, the questions is: does anybody knows how to pass the search text to the command performTextSearchWorkingSet ?
Sep 07 03:47:03 <psuzzi>	Current code in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500833#c5,
Sep 07 03:47:03 <psuzzi>	(from change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/80483/5/ )
Sep 07 03:48:50 <psuzzi>	pardon me, the Command ID is: org.eclipse.search.ui.performTextSearchWorkspace

Sep 07 14:00:27 <vastu5996>	hi, i am new to eclipse development, recently i am encountering this error while cloning eclipse projects :
Sep 07 14:00:33 <vastu5996>	premature EOF
Sep 07 14:00:48 <vastu5996>	index-failed
Sep 07 14:01:37 <vastu5996>	What might be the possible reasons and solutions for this issue?
Sep 09 07:02:11 <psuzzi>	I have a file resource loaded from an InputSource/InputStream.
Sep 09 07:02:12 <psuzzi>	How can I get the bundle-Id for the bundle containing that resource?
Sep 09 12:50:35 <nitind>	psuzzi: If you only have an input stream, that information has been lost.
Sep 09 12:50:54 <psuzzi>	nitind: thanks!
Sep 09 13:01:06 <psuzzi>	actually I had a org.w3c.css.sac.InputSource, but I think that is the same.
Sep 09 13:41:12 <nitind>	That might have the original URI in it. Depends on how the InputSource was instantiated.

Sep 16 08:49:49 <mistria>	psuzzi: apparently it was ;)

Sep 16 08:50:22 <mistria>	psuzzi: I don't remember the warning neither...
Sep 16 08:51:28 <psuzzi>	mistria: same for me, I think it will be good having a place where to check to see if the master is closed
Sep 16 08:52:05 <mistria>	psuzzi: or better, find a way to not require master to close

Sep 30 12:00:40 <psuzzi>	Does anybody know if SWT has a quick way to tell a KeyEvent.keyCode is alphanumerical [a-zA-Z0-9] ?
Sep 30 12:09:18 <psuzzi>	found: (e.keyCode >=97 && e.keyCode <=122) || (e.keyCode >=48 && e.keyCode <=57)
Sep 30 12:09:24 <psuzzi>	characters and digits
