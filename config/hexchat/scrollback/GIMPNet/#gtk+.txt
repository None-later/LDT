T 1470480929 18<jmd18>	I guess the thing is, if some random person suddenly announces "Hey! I have invented a new standard for fonts", it is unreasonable to expect the Gtk devs to drop everything and suddenly implement that standard.

T 1470661594 18<Company18>	ie if you transition from white to transparent (which is transparent black), 50% means semi-transparent gray
T 1470661648 18<Company18>	so it might in the end just be some bug about transitions in the parent widget causing transitions in the children to run (which they shouldn't but so far do)

T 1470661833 18<Company18>	yes

T 1470661867 18<Company18>	no
T 1470661888 18<Company18>	the specs require you to not start transitions if the change was caused by a transition
T 1470661920 18<Company18>	but for that you need a framework that tracks why some value changed
T 1470661947 18<Company18>	box-shadow: currentColor 1em 1em;
T 1470661965 18<Company18>	that one shoudln't start transitions if the parent runs a transition for font-size or color
T 1470661997 18<Company18>	so tracking that properly is hard
T 1470662017 18<Company18>	and it's not been necessary because themes don't nest transitions
T 1470662061 18<Company18>	ie we transition the button color, but not the color of it's label or the color of the box containing it

T 1470663980 18<mclasen18>	ebassi: oh, one question I pondered: what do you envision child-transform to be useful for ? the problem with using it to go clip->allocation is that it applies equally to all child nodes (widget ones and css ones)
T 1470664086 18<ebassi18>	mclasen: I added child-transform from ClutterActor; actors use it to do things like "scrollable actors". You set the child transform on the parent with the scrolling offset, and then children are all automatically transformed, instead of changing the transformations on each child
T 1470664146 18<mclasen18>	does that imply that there's some parent-child clipping then ?

T 1470665132 18<mclasen18>	this is somewhat related to clipping too: if we place the widget node at the allocation, we need to be able to add a larger node for the widget clip, without having the parent node clip it away

T 1470667504 18<nacho_18>	ebassi, in a non recursive makefile if I do NAMESPACE = pipo/my-namespace I want the generated enums.xml in pipo/ but I do not want pipo to be part of the namespace

T 1470667579 18<ebassi18>	jjardon: You added it to Makefile.am/EXTRA_DIST
T 1470667588 18<ebassi18>	It's a generated file, it should not be added to the dist
T 1470667629 18<jjardon18>	ebassi: what module is this? gettextize modify the Makefile.am when you run it
T 1470667639 18<ebassi18>	jjardon: gtk+

T 1470669253 18<throwaway57418>	I have a client trying to run a GTK program on their computer, but they have a high DPI setting and the program does not render correctly.  Is there a way to 'ignore' the DPI settings?
T 1470669371 18<aruiz18>	throwaway574, what version of Gtk+? What desktop? What OS/version?
T 1470669687 18<throwaway57418>	3.14.15, Windows.  I'm more curious as to whether or not there is anything in GTK itself that can ignore the DPI settings in any version/environment.  Just knowing if it is possible in any context is what I'm looking for.
T 1470669934 18<pmike18>	g_data_input_stream_readline is supposed to block or return NULL if there is no more data left in the receiving buffer?

T 1470670553 18<aruiz18>	throwaway574, in any case, 3.14 is kind of dated atm...
