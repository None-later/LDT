T 1521212171 18<hukhan18>	you don't need access to the source code, you just need access to their inputs and some sort of a feedback result, no?

T 1521212253 18<hukhan18>	that would be dope 
T 1521212266 18<chkoehle18>	only because its a simple and easy game
T 1521212286 18<rubao18>	hukhan:  not for mmorpg now, but an AI do " kinda" existed for dota 2 sometime ago
T 1521212297 18<hukhan18>	what kind of ai? 
T 1521212302 18<chkoehle18>	i thought someone at openAI made some dota2 bot that wrecked their top players
T 1521212309 18<rubao18>	yup ^
T 1521212350 18<almac18>	optimal bots are kind of boring, there's been some research and prototypes done
T 1521212351 18<almac18>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxwPr9oxUMw
T 1521212354 18<almac18>	pretty neat though
T 1521212382 18<almac18>	at least in smash 4, the optimal bot would never jump, because it introduced landing lag and puts you in disadvantage state
T 1521212406 18<almac18>	so bots based around completely grounded characters and frame perfect sheilds/dodges/movements would probably come out on top
T 1521212417 18<almac18>	i wonder if that'd mean little mac becomes top tier ..
T 1521212430 18<chkoehle18>	little mac on top
T 1521212435 18<chkoehle18>	i've learned to hate jumping
T 1521212446 18<chkoehle18>	anything not on the ground sucks
T 1521212596 18<hukhan18>	I think bots that play like actual players would definitely be recieved a lot better
T 1521212613 18<hukhan18>	that's the problem with fighting ai in smash, perfect shields/dodges are just kinda lame
T 1521212631 18<almac18>	yeah but then you're basically sabotaging your own ai
T 1521212646 18<rubao18>	hukhan: yea, it kinda made game not fun
T 1521212675 18*	rubao thinks people make mistakes in games are also a fun part to make the game interesting :D
T 1521212682 18<hukhan18>	I don't think so, if you get input data over thousands of games from pro players, you can get bots trained on their styles, then practice with their playstyle through bots
T 1521212708 18<hukhan18>	that's a lot more interesting imo
T 1521212719 18<rubao18>	yea
T 1521212731 18<rubao18>	and it made the ai theoretically beatable too
T 1521212736 18<almac18>	yeah i guess so, but would they not learn 'optimal' playstyles over thousands more games?
T 1521212755 18<chkoehle18>	i always wanted to see the perfect AI play to see what kind of playstyle emerges
T 1521212756 18<hukhan18>	more data would result in accuracy not optimal results
T 1521212758 18<almac18>	like we're at the current meta of movement/play styles because of how much time has progress and how many games they've played
T 1521212762 18<hukhan18>	on a neural net
T 1521212779 18<hukhan18>	it depends on your goals and what you are trying to achieve
T 1521212780 18<almac18>	if we could speed it up with simulations and say run games at 1000x the speed, would we reach optimal plays sooner?
T 1521212807 18<hukhan18>	if you're result scores for the neural net are based on wins not accuracy to player style then you will reach otpimal results
T 1521212808 18<almac18>	i clearly just want to take over the world with smash bots
T 1521212828 18<hukhan18>	this is at leas my layman understanding of machine learning
