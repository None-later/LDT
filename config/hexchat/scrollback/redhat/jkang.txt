T 1478555587 18<jkang>	I searched online about the JNI UTF-8 thing. Seems like a pretty old design choice but kind of funny now. I don't think there's much you can do to change it :\
T 1478555603 20<lufimtse>30	hmmm
T 1478555605 20<lufimtse>30	Life sucks
T 1478555619 18<jkang>	I think the best way to handle it is not use JNI for passing Strings around. Leave it as bytes and then encode/decode when you need it.
T 1478555643 20<lufimtse>30	Yea, I've been gravitating into that direction. Now I'm fiddling around on how to best convert to bytes and back.
T 1478555655 18<jkang>	Java side it's pretty easy... C side iunno
T 1478555669 20<lufimtse>30	I found a git repo 

T 1478555677 18<jkang>	I'm sure there's libraries around to handle this hahah
T 1478555679 20<lufimtse>30	The guy talks about it

T 1478555744 18<jkang>	It's not too hard to write a few helper methods for this... but I guess it would be nice if JNI didn't use modified utf-8
T 1478555800 20<lufimtse>30	Yea, it's like I've spent a fair bit of time learning how to deal with strings in JNI. then I've found that the modified JNI-UTF-8 screws people over, then I've learned that you have to hack around it via bytes[] etc...
T 1478555803 20<lufimtse>30	like why...
T 1478555821 18<jkang>	Hahah...
T 1478555822 20<lufimtse>30	there doesn't seem to be a good reason for having a custom utf
T 1478555883 18<jkang>	here it explains a bit about the format: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni/spec/types.html#wp16542
T 1478555906 18<jkang>	"This means that modified UTF-8 strings never have embedded nulls."
T 1478555919 18<jkang>	If normal UTF-8 strings have embedded nulls it would simply not work in C
T 1478555933 18<jkang>	when using standard libraries that rely on null terminators
T 1478555963 18<jkang>	Well... Iunno hahah
T 1478555979 20<lufimtse>30	"This means that modified UTF-8 strings never have embedded nulls."  <<<< meh?
T 1478555980 18<jkang>	I may be misthinking null means null terminator

T 1478556058 18<jkang>	yeah I was right
T 1478556073 18<jkang>	it's also significantly faster
T 1478556188 18<jkang>	e.g. strlen computes length of string up to but not including first null character
T 1478556205 18<jkang>	a modified utf-8 string with embedded nulls would not have the correct length output by strlen
T 1478556208 18<jkang>	er
T 1478556212 18<jkang>	a standard utf-8 string
T 1478556222 18<jkang>	a modified utf-8 string doesn't have this issue
T 1478556230 18<jkang>	there are never null characters in the middle of the string
T 1478556257 20<lufimtse>30	hmmm

T 1478556269 20<lufimtse>30	but why not support the 4th byte
T 1478557420 18<jkang>	Because then there would be the possibility of a String having null inside it.
