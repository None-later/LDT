T 1540240169 18<jkang|wfh>	regarding JMC and OpenJDK, it is available in 11+
T 1540240170 20<lufimtse>30	will do.
T 1540240175 18<jkang|wfh>	JDK 11+ that is
T 1540240181 20<lufimtse>30	I see. Do you know much about visualvm?
T 1540240181 18<jkang|wfh>	JFR is available in 11+
T 1540240188 18<jkang|wfh>	JMC is standalone and runs on anything
T 1540240203 18<jkang|wfh>	VisualVM is also standalone and available
T 1540240212 18<jkang|wfh>	it has been open source for quite some time
T 1540240222 20<lufimtse>30	good to know.
T 1540240232 18<jkang|wfh>	for more details: JFR is an internal JVM system for recording events
T 1540240245 18<jkang|wfh>	it is available in Oracle JDKs, and OpenJDK 11+
T 1540240253 20<lufimtse>30	ah

T 1540240265 18<jkang|wfh>	JMC is able to read JFR recording files to display information
T 1540240285 18<jkang|wfh>	JMC itself is just an Eclipse Plugin-based application; it can run on most JVMs, 8+
T 1540240300 18<jkang|wfh>	but obviously it's not too useful without any JFR recordings to read
T 1540240315 18<jkang|wfh>	it does have JMX support, which does not need JFR, but the capabilities are limited
T 1540240328 18<jkang|wfh>	lot's of acronyms starting with J, sorry
