T 1498512941 18<nboldt>	have to log in via that page and link to https://training-lms.redhat.com/Saml/AuthRequest?sitename=redhatint so you can sign up without having to provide a credit card
T 1498513120 18<nboldt>	hope that helps! not a lot of available in-class options for these courses/exams.

T 1511886124 20<lufimtse>30	we have "Eclipse Release Train" and "Developer Tools" projects
T 1511886147 20<lufimtse>30	Do we have any use for "Developer Tools" project?
T 1511886162 20<lufimtse>30	Or do all our work in "Eclipse Release Train"
T 1511886216 18<nboldt>	you tell me
T 1511886245 20<lufimtse>30	lol, dunnow. I created my stuff in Developer tools, but Sopot is asking to have it created in Eclipse Release train
T 1511886253 20<lufimtse>30	so I'm like confused
T 1511886264 18<nboldt>	I think the idea was that we could track items in ERT ~= Eclipse Bugzilla, RHBZ ~= Red Hat Bugzilla... and anything related to devtools which is NOT in those two could be tracked in DevTools
T 1511886266 20<lufimtse>30	if we should work in ERT, why keep dev tools around?
T 1511886283 18<nboldt>	eg., RCM tickets?
T 1511886288 20<lufimtse>30	RCM?
T 1511886303 18<nboldt>	yeah like https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/RCM-23773

T 1511886464 20<lufimtse>30	is there a way to move tasks between projects?
T 1511886480 18<nboldt>	yes, if you're an admin in both I think you can move them
T 1511886485 18<nboldt>	give me a link 
T 1511886507 20<lufimtse>30	ah, I think I can move them
T 1511886552 18<nboldt>	ok cool
T 1511886596 18<nboldt>	in the past ERT issues have simply been dupes of BZ, but if Sopot wants us to start creating ERT issues that don't have equivalencies to Eclipse BZ, then ... well, we prolly don't need devtools 
T 1511886625 18<nboldt>	meanwhile the python script that scrapes EBZ and RHBZ is still broken - haven't had time yet to investigate
