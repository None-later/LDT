T 1511886124 20<lufimtse>30	we have "Eclipse Release Train" and "Developer Tools" projects
T 1511886147 20<lufimtse>30	Do we have any use for "Developer Tools" project?
T 1511886162 20<lufimtse>30	Or do all our work in "Eclipse Release Train"
T 1511886216 18<nboldt>	you tell me
T 1511886245 20<lufimtse>30	lol, dunnow. I created my stuff in Developer tools, but Sopot is asking to have it created in Eclipse Release train
T 1511886253 20<lufimtse>30	so I'm like confused
T 1511886264 18<nboldt>	I think the idea was that we could track items in ERT ~= Eclipse Bugzilla, RHBZ ~= Red Hat Bugzilla... and anything related to devtools which is NOT in those two could be tracked in DevTools
T 1511886266 20<lufimtse>30	if we should work in ERT, why keep dev tools around?
T 1511886283 18<nboldt>	eg., RCM tickets?
T 1511886288 20<lufimtse>30	RCM?
T 1511886303 18<nboldt>	yeah like https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/RCM-23773

T 1511886596 18<nboldt>	in the past ERT issues have simply been dupes of BZ, but if Sopot wants us to start creating ERT issues that don't have equivalencies to Eclipse BZ, then ... well, we prolly don't need devtools

T 1536585921 18<nboldt>	how can I help?
T 1536585925 20<lufimtse>30	I'm taking the jboss courses right now, they're covering "Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio". I'm wondering, is that something we can just run like eclipse or must it be installed?
T 1536585943 20<lufimtse>30	on Fedora
T 1536585961 18<nboldt>	https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_developer_studio/12.0/html/installation_guide/
T 1536585981 18<nboldt>	tl;dr: you have to install it on top of Eclipse rpm, or install it from the .jar file
T 1536586001 20<lufimtse>30	So I can't just extract & run like a regular eclipse?
T 1536586001 18<nboldt>	once installed, yes, you run it like you run eclipse
T 1536586021 18<nboldt>	no, it's not built like an Eclipse tarball
T 1536586033 20<lufimtse>30	ah ok. 
T 1536586039 18<nboldt>	it's either an updare site, or a installer.jar that you run w/ java
T 1536586043 20<lufimtse>30	do you run fedora on your system?
T 1536586051 18<nboldt>	there IS a commandline way to run the installer w/o gui 
T 1536586053 18<nboldt>	yes
T 1536586070 20<lufimtse>30	how do you recommend installing it, fedora rpm or a different way?
T 1536586101 18<nboldt>	if you want it self-contained and independent from your other eclipse rpm install
T 1536586102 18<nboldt>	then...

T 1536586112 18<nboldt>	use the installer jar
T 1536586136 18<nboldt>	but if you want to install it just as a set of features into an existing Eclipse, use Eclipse Marketplace

T 1536586158 18<nboldt>	both options are valid, just depends on your preference
T 1536586174 18<nboldt>	installer is a better option for offline (like in RH classrooms and demos)
T 1536586247 18<nboldt>	marketplace is a better option for online as you get a Devstudio install that also has support for using Eclipse Marketplace; installer does NOT include marketplace support unless you install MPC manually because it's a stripped down Eclipse-based Product 
T 1536586272 20<lufimtse>30	I see.
T 1536586288 20<lufimtse>30	Does dev studio work with latest eclipse or do I need to check out older versions?
