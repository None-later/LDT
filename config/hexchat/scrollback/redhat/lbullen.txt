What you'll notice is that in later chapters they explain a lot of stuff that is wtf in earlier chapters and you get a better feel for what's important.
T 1518120101 20<lufimtse>30	with the initial notes, I wouldn't focus so much on the details, just make sure you understand the concepts etc..
T 1518120117 18<lbullen>	Ok thanks
T 1518120329 20<lufimtse>30	As a note, I think all the interns who failed the exam the first time didn't take the exam again (9/10 failed). I think I was the only one to try again and pass the 2nd time around. I wouldn't get too discouraged if you fail exam first time around, just try again. 2nd time around you have a better understanding of what to do on the exam. It's like drivers test.
