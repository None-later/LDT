T 1520274185 20<lufimtse>30	interesting
T 1520274217 20<lufimtse>30	in SWT we usually keep almost everything in java land
T 1520274232 20<lufimtse>30	like we get C pointers into Java and then do the conversion of gVariants etc.. on the java side
T 1520274241 20<lufimtse>30	but I guess that's kinda complicated for just a shim.
T 1520274254 20<lufimtse>30	but if you need any gdbus/jni support from SWT, we could certainly investigate such support.
T 1520274294 20<lufimtse>30	The reason we keep things in java land is because debugging the C part of a JVM is kinda complicated.
T 1520274305 20<lufimtse>30	one has to attach debugger etc..
T 1520274331 20<lufimtse>30	in SWT we already have the gvariant builder commands etc...
