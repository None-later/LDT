T 1538588276 19<dbhole>	lufimtse: we do no support for Oracle JDK. Unless they are getting Oracle JDK through us already, they are no longer allowed to install new instances. Any instances they have will become completely unsupported after November 2018. Until then, we will support existing Oracle JDK installs for installation/packaging issues, and we can open a ticket on behalf of customers with Oracle, but we cannot guarantee fixes and that too will stop ...
T 1538588283 18<dbhole18>	... after November 2018
T 1538588287 18<jvanek18>	aph,  you see? Again sombody wishes static builds

T 1538588327 20*	lufimtse 30curious
T 1538588358 18<dbhole18>	basically, unless they are paying Oracle JDK, their only option is to use OpenJDK. Oracle JDK8 from the Oracle site can be used until Jan 2019 only, after that it turns paid. Oracle JDK11 is not allowed for commercial use at all from their site. For commercial use, the only option is http://jdk.java.net/11/ which till be updated until March 2019
T 1538588467 18<dbhole18>	jvanek: their use case makes sense though,, in the Java world it is pretty common to want to use zips and as you stated in bug today, with dynamic they cant use latest openjdk on EUS streams 
T 1538588482 18<dbhole18>	as much of a pain it is for us :)

T 1538588665 18<dbhole18>	jvanek: they are not legacy, we actively support RHEL 7.3 still for example.. customers on that have no way to use newer secure OpenJDK there
T 1538588677 18<jvanek18>	dbhole,  hm
T 1538588687 18<jvanek18>	right, jdk was happily excluded from those ELTS supports

T 1538590339 20<lufimtse>30	aph, jvanek dbhole. Is OpenJDK more or less the same as OracleJDK these days or is there something that OracleJDK does that OpenJDK doesn't?
T 1538590375 19<dbhole>	lufimtse: as far as Java SE is concerned, more or less the same -- some minor differences in font rendering and such
T 1538590481 19<dbhole>	lufimtse: We do not ship JavaFX so if they have any JavaFX apps those will not port.. JavaFX is not part of the Java SE specification though so if the apps are correctly SE compliant, they should just work.. tbh the best way is to just replace the jdk in a sandbox and see if the app works and passes tests.. it is quite easy to replace

T 1539877004 20<lufimtse>30	jerboaa, In regards to our earlier discussion on using java versions. The client here wants to run different java applications on different OpenJDK 'minor' versions. (e.g 8.60  8.151,   8.181). The reason is that some apps take longer to test/verify than others and they have multiple apps per server. Our KB says that as of RHEL 7 this is supported: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3508401 . If I understand correctly, they would have to 
T 1539877004 20<lufimtse>30	set the JAVA_HOME manually and refer to the java by full path. Are there any problems/concerns that come to mind by using this method for running eap/spring java applications?
T 1539877083 18<shade18>	the usual recipe is: export JAVA_HOME=...; export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH -- because some tools are known to reach for e.g. javac via path too
T 1539877310 19<jerboaa>	lufimtse, I don't know about the supported way for running eap/spring with a given JAVA_HOME. but yes, parallel minor versions is something we support as described via the KB article. Of course that means users won't get security updates et. al.
T 1539877340 19<jerboaa>	lufimtse, that's for eap/spring people to tell you.
T 1539877387 20<lufimtse>30	shade, jerboaa I see. Thank you.  Btw, the article mentions (in a private comment) that that is only for RHEL 7+. Do we support minor versions for RHEL 6 too?
T 1539877428 19<jerboaa>	lufimtse, also note that if customers run into JDK crashes with some old version we usually ask them as one of the first questions as to whether it reproduces on latest supported JDK

T 1539879507 20<lufimtse>30	my concern is that OpenJDK uses system libs and if those are updated, it could break some apps that use older openjdk apps. but idk
T 1539879712 18<jerboaa18>	I'm not sure. But given there is API/ABI promise for RHEL, I'd think it should be OK. at least we haven't heard of issues related to that.
T 1539879731 18<jerboaa18>	this installonlypkgs trick is still somewhat a corner case
T 1539879788 18<omajid_wfh18>	i think an upgrade of nss might cause an issue. historically version mismatch between nss and openjdk has been problematic, because we use internal apis from nss 
T 1539879862 18<jerboaa18>	omajid_wfh, weren't the issues wrt. to newer nss used at build time than was available at runtime?

T 1539879943 18<omajid_wfh18>	jerboaa: you are probably right. i just remember the version mismatches caused issues.
