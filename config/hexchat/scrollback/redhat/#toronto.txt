Leh is 3500m, the attempt is at 4000m, but it is in a politically sensitive area and on a diplomatic passport I need a special permit, which is a PITA to get, so the canadian high commission team (New Delhi Sacred Bulls) won't be participating this year.

T 1517596847 18<fche18>	I wonder if the outages y'all are noticing are broken dhcp - where machines for some reason time out their dhcp leases around the same time, and have to restart their protocols from scratch (with DHCPBROADCAST etc.)
T 1517596871 18<fche18>	would be interesting to see whether a machine with a fixed ip address is also noticing router/traffic outages at all
T 1517596897 18<sergiodj18>	fche: I don't see any requests being made to 10.5.something here.  my machine sends DCHPREQUEST's to 10.11.something, and after several hours without response it starts broadcasting it (also without response)
T 1517596917 18<sergiodj18>	a fixed IP would certainly be helpful in investigating this.  not sure it's possible/feasible to get one
