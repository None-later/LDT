T 1510080049 18<chkoehle18>	chocolate ice cream is delayed :/ apparently you need to stir it because the outsides touching the bowl turn into proper ice cream, but it shields the center from freezing so the center was just really cold milk... hopefully it'll turn into it properly in ~1 hr

T 1510080204 18<chkoehle18>	i figure it has to be like the consistency of the stuff attached to the bowl, cause the center was basically pure liquid

T 1510080332 18<mwringe18>	if the bowl is already frozen and your ingredients are cold, you just need to leave it stirring for a while 
T 1510080367 18<mwringe18>	the more its stirred, the more the liquid ingredients get in contact with the cold bowl and freeze
