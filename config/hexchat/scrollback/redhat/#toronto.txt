T 1502376442 20<lufimtse_>30	clessard, I've had to deal with some stuff related to that.
T 1502376742 19<clessard>	lufimtse_: thanks for the reply. ive lived in my apart for two years now; after first year one of my roomates switched out and we signed a new lease. the landlord applied a typical 2% rent increase. our lease is for september-september, and two of my roomates have now left with two other (currently subleting) replacing them. we were asked in june if we wanted to renew, to which we said yes
T 1502376744 18<clessard18>	and I let the landlord know the tenants had changed. 
T 1502376781 18<clessard18>	last night my landlord told me out of the blue that with new tenants she can form a new lease and new rent, asking for 400$ more. she said that given the late notice, the lowest she could discuss was about 200$ more. is she allowed to do this ? 
T 1502376850 18<clessard18>	lets discuss in private chat. 
T 1502376862 18<hukhan18>	:(
T 1502376880 18<ericwill18>	AFAIK you are not obligated to renew a lease in Ontario, it goes to month-to-month after a lease expires
T 1502377162 20<lufimtse_>30	clessard, if the increase is more than 1.5%, then usually landlord needs permission I think
T 1502377172 20<lufimtse_>30	(but should be checked)
T 1502377666 18<jkang|wfh18>	I'd probably find someone to call who can give advice on these matters, e.g. Lukas' suggestion with sjto
T 1502377889 18<jkang|wfh18>	clessard, I'm pretty sure, even if it switches to month-to-month, it is still covered by the Residential Tenancies Act, and they can only increase up to the guideline unless they submit a L5 request
T 1502377939 18<jkang|wfh18>	or you both sign a N10
T 1502378197 18<jkang|wfh18>	clessard, once it's month to month they are able to give 60 day notice of termination with good reason. Given your lease is ending Sept. and it's Aug. they probably can't legally get you evicted any time soon
T 1502378621 18<jkang|wfh18>	clessard, also rent increase notice must be 90 days. I think your landlord seems pretty fishy atm. *shrugs*
T 1502378761 18<clessard18>	yeah. shes certainly trying to make it seem like this is a brand new lease and justify the rent increase that way.
T 1502378856 18<clessard18>	im not really sure what shes going to say.. i called and they said that technically neither of us are obliged to contract a new lease
T 1502378857 18<jkang|wfh18>	clessard, if she wants to offer a new lease, she is allowed to do that. You need not accept. And the 60 day termination notice does apply if she wants to evict you. When your lease ends, it automatically becomes month-to-month and you can be removed with 60 day notice and good reason
T 1502378897 18<clessard18>	ahh thats bad
T 1502379408 18<jkang|wfh18>	clessard, also in Ontario, you cannot be evicted without good reason: http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/documents/ltb/Brochures/How%20a%20Landlord%20Can%20End%20a%20Tenancy%20(EN)%20Revised_Bill140_June15_2015.pdf
T 1502379447 18<jkang|wfh18>	though they can just say they'll be using it personally for a month or two or something; and then put it back on the market after. It's generally just a pain for both sides to go this way though...
T 1502379488 18<clessard18>	yeah i agree. i sent her an email about it so ill see what she says. if it needs to be a 5% hike then ill live with it and find something new next year cuz its still a better deal than most places
T 1502379544 18<jkang|wfh18>	clessard, also; even if it's a 'new lease' there are restrictions on what can be changed if it's made with the same tenant. Having new tenants seems pretty shaky since you're still there.
T 1502379554 18<jkang|wfh18>	have to read up on that though...
T 1502379930 18<lbullen18>	 clessard I know that if 50% or more of the tenants leave a place the "only can raise it by X%" rules don't apply. Had to deal with that last year

T 1502381196 18<jkang|wfh18>	clessard, I have yet to find anything concrete on subset of tenants leaving and new lease in the Residential Tenanices Act. I'd probably ask for legal advice..
