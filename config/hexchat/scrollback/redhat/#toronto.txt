T 1486585373 18<steveg18>	yobshans, it's authing but the account needs certain permissions to access the api

T 1486585775 18<steveg18>	dcheung, yeah the permissions are tied to objects
T 1486585788 18<steveg18>	dcheung, so to give it on the cluster you have to select the cluster and go to its permissions tab
T 1486585795 18<steveg18>	dcheung, and add eapbatch there
