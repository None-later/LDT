T 1524599470 18<smcbrien18>	jzaher: That may be a function of your environment more than the infrastructure.
T 1524599511 18<smcbrien18>	jzaher|brb: also, even though the machines are 'booted' and you can log into them, the openstack services may not be up or up correctly.  You'll want to check those as your first stop anytime you're troubleshooting.
T 1524601854 18<jzaher18>	smcbrien: but the problem is that the machines never get "powered on".  The setup script just hangs there.  And if I manually power on one of them, say the controller, then it hangs when it tries to power on the next node.
T 1524607776 18<smcbrien18>	jzaher|away: Right.  I'd suggest, if you're having issues with setup scripts that you look at openstack-services status to make sure your stack services are straight before the script (which may or may not check depending on the author) gets run again.  It is not uncommon for things to take 10-20 minutes to 'normalize' after boot.  Systemd kicks a bunch of stuff off in parallel, so just because you can log into the machine, it doesn't mean
