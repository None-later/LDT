T 1518724403 20<lufimtse>30	or the selected dark theme color of INFORMATION is too dark?
T 1518724439 18<rgrunber18>	well yeah, it looks that way. fwiw i see the colour of the actual shell in many other areas on the dark theme
T 1518724500 18<rgrunber18>	toolbar items for example are a light gray.. like the text background in that tooltip popup.. and when you hover over them they become a darker colour.. more like the background of the styled text.
T 1518725214 20<lufimtse>30	rgrunber, hmmm. I wonder if it makes sense to make INFORMATION color lighter by default. Would that break anything?
T 1518725229 20<lufimtse>30	like make it light black
T 1518725254 20<lufimtse>30	I recall having issues with the light/dark black in the past as well
T 1518725307 18<rgrunber18>	the other thing is afaict the shell, styled text, link, and toolbar item are all getting set to the same background, but something might override it ?
T 1518725352 18<rgrunber18>	seems like for a shell the setbackground is more of a hint..
T 1518729554 19<rgrunber>	lufimtse: is it possible to change a widget foreground/background if it has already been defined in a theme .css ?.. or will that always override it..

T 1518729664 20<lufimtse>30	I think it's possible. E.g a user color can override a system/theme color. E.g try setting javadoc color in dark theme.

T 1518796687 18<ericwill18>	another thing is CSS based sizing is a really tricky issue, as platform UI sets the size for widgets in the IDE
T 1518796719 18<ericwill18>	if we allow for any theme to set their own min-size it will open up all sorts of corner case bug reports that will be tough to debug

T 1519850034 20<lufimtse>30	akurtakov, let's disscuss:
T 1519850044 20<lufimtse>30	akurtakov, I can fix the issue by commenting out line line of code
T 1519850052 20<lufimtse>30	which is actually a workaround to a previous issue
T 1519850059 20<lufimtse>30	but I don't know if it breaks stuff
T 1519850064 20<lufimtse>30	basically, 
T 1519850078 20<lufimtse>30	if you would insert a column with no items, it used to cause problems
T 1519850085 20<lufimtse>30	so they inserted it hidden (visible=false)
T 1519850091 20<lufimtse>30	and then made it visible when the first item was shown
T 1519850100 20<lufimtse>30	in the past it seemed to cause ATK to crash
T 1519850113 20<lufimtse>30	but now I've tested inserting visible columns, it doesn't crash atk anymore
T 1519850301 19<akurtakov>	lufimtse: even with gtk2 ?
T 1519850318 18<akurtakov18>	can you think of other reason to insert column invisible 
T 1519850333 20<lufimtse>30	so the trouble is I'm not very aqainted with Tables/Trees
T 1519850336 20<lufimtse>30	so I'm now reading up on them
T 1519850349 20<lufimtse>30	I.e aquiring Table-foo
T 1519850367 20<lufimtse>30	Option 1) Fix it proper. Which might take a while.
T 1519850376 20<lufimtse>30	Option 2) Fix quicker, and hope for the best.
T 1519850389 20<lufimtse>30	with option 2, just test all snippets 
T 1519850392 20<lufimtse>30	and IDE
T 1519850398 20<lufimtse>30	if all looks well, go for it.
T 1519850408 20<lufimtse>30	with option 1, really understand why we're hiding stuff
T 1519850418 20<lufimtse>30	and see if we can get rid of the hiding mechanism altogether
T 1519850425 20<lufimtse>30	as it seems to cause bunch of drawing issues
T 1519850433 20<lufimtse>30	also the invisibility of columns is generating some warnings for atk
T 1519850441 20<lufimtse>30	e.g: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=399522

T 1519850507 20<lufimtse>30	I'll spent some time to figure out the visibility, a few days. If I make good propress go the long route. If I don't make a quicker fix and hope for the best.

T 1519851568 18<akurtakov18>	ericwill: the only effect such comments have on me is becoming more stubborn and selfish

T 1519853899 18<ericwill18>	akurtakov for the context menu bug: how concerned are you for a fix on GTK3 versions less than 3.22

T 1519854162 18<ericwill18>	akurtakov I didn't use new API but the fix works with the newest API, 3.20- menu popup API is really ancient

T 1519856232 20<lufimtse>30	could be she's not using Adwaita
T 1519856235 20<lufimtse>30	maybe
T 1519856249 20<lufimtse>30	I haven't tested with non-adwaita

T 1519856293 18<rgrunber18>	iirc she runs Macos right ?
T 1519856315 18<rgrunber18>	but yeah no idea.. guess i'll ask for clarification
T 1519856435 18<akurtakov18>	rgrunber: probably the Expression view gets fixed on Fedora by our hack to switch to Adwaita:dark
T 1519856448 18<akurtakov18>	please try with another theme and you'll probably see the issue
T 1519856526 18<akurtakov18>	rgrunber: alternatively you can try running as child eclipse without org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk
T 1519856734 18<akurtakov18>	rgrunber: org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk really fixes many dark theme issues on proper GTK :)
T 1519856764 18<akurtakov18>	or to be exact hides improper theming :)
T 1519856908 18<rgrunber18>	expression view still shows up .. dark.
T 1519856930 18<rgrunber18>	in fact it was the same on windows so i kinda wondered if it could be linux related at all..
T 1519856944 18<rgrunber18>	though yeah.. that little fragment actually makes dark theme look better
T 1519857034 18<akurtakov18>	rgrunber: than post screenshot and say you don't see what's to be fixed there :)

T 1519918258 18<ericwill18>	akurtakov what is a fast view
T 1519918266 18<akurtakov18>	even making it back not fast view the menu keeps appearing wrong

T 1519918350 18<ericwill18>	akurtakov okay now I can reproduce it
T 1519918363 18<akurtakov18>	ericwill: I'm not sure whether to say good :0
T 1519918395 18<ericwill18>	akurtakov probably a symptom of: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=530204
T 1519918406 18<ericwill18>	most of the menus attached to buttons use Menu.setLocation()
T 1519918418 18<ericwill18>	and on Wayland with no global coords this is broken :)
T 1519918438 18<akurtakov18>	well mouse is at the button :)
T 1519918622 18<ericwill18>	akurtakov I thought so too but a lot of these menus are called like this: https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.ui/blob/9eb944951a256f97fbbc78ad4749d1cbd04925d3/bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/OpenResourceDialog.java#L336

T 1519918838 18<akurtakov18>	ericwill: I see 
T 1519918854 18<akurtakov18>	so we need to fix the callers ?
T 1519918870 18<akurtakov18>	have you documented that this is not working on wayland in the javadoc
T 1519918881 18<akurtakov18>	it would be needed when we go fixing callers
T 1519918893 18<akurtakov18>	at least I don't see other option - do you ?
T 1519918909 18<ericwill18>	akurtakov well currently Menu.setLocation() is completely ignored
T 1519918928 18<ericwill18>	we should fix that first, then try to fix the callers
T 1519918934 18<akurtakov18>	ericwill: fix how ?
T 1519918965 18<ericwill18>	akurtakov with GTK3.22 we have: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkMenu.html#gtk-menu-popup-at-rect
T 1519918974 18<ericwill18>	we should check in menu._setVisible
T 1519918989 18<ericwill18>	"if (hasLocation), do x"
T 1519919134 18<ericwill18>	if you look in Menu.java, the x and y variables are never used when popping up the menu
T 1519919176 18<ericwill18>	that said, we should probably fix the javadocs as well because Menu.setLocation() is global coords, not parent-relative
T 1519919187 18<akurtakov18>	ericwill: so how does it open correctly now ?
T 1519919192 18<akurtakov18>	if x and y are not used ?
T 1519919203 18<akurtakov18>	s/now/on x11/
T 1519919226 18<ericwill18>	it grabs the mouse button event and pops up there, the fact that it works on X11 is a coincidence :)
T 1519919242 18<akurtakov18>	ericwill: wow :)
T 1519919251 18<akurtakov18>	ericwill: btw, ask Andrey to verify the bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=431423
