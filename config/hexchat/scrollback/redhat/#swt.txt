T 1506524937 20<lufimtse>30	my theory is that during display dispose, it disposes webkit
T 1506524941 20<lufimtse>30	then webkit tries to dispose again

T 1506525067 20<lufimtse>30	As a sidenode, the coverage tool helped a lot narrowing down code that ran and code that didn't
T 1506525284 18<akurtakov18>	well, display dispose should end up calling browser dispose
T 1506525292 18<akurtakov18>	which should dispose webkit
T 1506525301 18<akurtakov18>	and webkit shouldn't try to dispose later

T 1506525684 20<lufimtse>30	I looked into glib's exit.c, it's basically a mechanism to run clean-up tasks after main loop finishes

T 1512137399 18<ericwill18>	so I think the issue here lies that the GTK CSS applied to the widget doesn't always equal what SWT returns

T 1512147627 20<lufimtse>30	rgrunber, can we make webkit think that the webpage url changed?
T 1512147649 20<lufimtse>30	like, not just set the text, but suppose the js on the page want's to know which url/domain it's on, will git get the new domain?

T 1512147784 20<lufimtse>30	rgrunber, like:   alert( "The full URL of this page is:<br>" + window.location.href)

T 1512147795 20<lufimtse>30	not the old one.
T 1512147827 18<rgrunber18>	they'd be the same.. the url of the post request is the same as if we just did a get.. post just specifies what data we send to that url.
T 1512148027 20<lufimtse>30	I mean once we got something in java, how do we set webkit to that data such that the webpageURL is also set properly?
T 1512148128 20<lufimtse>30	rgrunber, as a sidenote, the javascript/form hack doesn't deal with headers. So we'd either be able to set url with custom headers or url with postdata, but not both.
T 1512148132 18<rgrunber18>	by calling setURL with no post data the first time , the url would be correct.
T 1512148165 20<lufimtse>30	rgrunber, so call url, then call url with postdata and set page data with the result we got from java?
T 1512148196 20<lufimtse>30	rgrunber, I wonder if we can set the url, but then stop loading via signal, then set the page data
T 1512148202 20<lufimtse>30	hmmm
T 1512148210 20<lufimtse>30	rgrunber, that could prevent double load.
T 1512148231 20<lufimtse>30	brb.
T 1512148272 18<rgrunber18>	another possibility is in setText() itself of browser. it calls webkit_web_view_load_html. that function takes a base_uri as the last argument, because the render the html it might have to resolve things like images, relative to the base uri, so it does some additional GET requests.. i wonder if webkit might handle setting the url to base_uri..
T 1512148344 18<rgrunber18>	currently we only pass in about:blank, or file:/// for setText().. but we could add some special field there, that if set, passes the actual base_uri from setURL..

T 1512150221 20<lufimtse>30	rgrunber, maybe we should make it clear that we need to be able to do post+headers, not necesserily access to soupmessage
T 1512150237 20<lufimtse>30	that seems like more reasonable api than requesting soupmessage access
