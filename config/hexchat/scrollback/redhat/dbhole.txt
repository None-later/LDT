T 1539888534 18<dbhole>	Hey Leo, whats up?
T 1539888611 20<lufimtse>30	to answer your email
T 1539888612 20<lufimtse>30	rpm -qf /usr/lib/jvm-exports/jre-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64
T 1539888612 20<lufimtse>30	error: file /usr/lib/jvm-exports/jre-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64: No such file or directory
T 1539888618 20<lufimtse>30	nothing in there
T 1539888645 18<dbhole>	What command are they trying to run? It is weird that there is a conflict when there is nothing on the system. Are they trying to install both at once?
T 1539888662 18<dbhole>	what does 'rpm -qa | grep -i openjdk' say?
T 1539888684 20<lufimtse>30	hmm. I'm wondering, do we generally support RHEL 6+ multiple openJDK versions?
T 1539888693 20<lufimtse>30	like if we get this working, is that supported?
T 1539888726 18<dbhole>	oh, for 6, no.. only 7 and up
T 1539888738 18<dbhole>	that would explain why you are having the issue
T 1539888754 20<lufimtse>30	ok. My note was that it works on RHEL 7 and on RHEL 6 I was getting transaction error
T 1539888773 20<lufimtse>30	"Works on RHEL 7 (as per kb) but on RHEL 6 it throws rpm package conflicts. if I try to install."
T 1539888789 20<lufimtse>30	sorry for ambiduity
T 1539888797 20<lufimtse>30	ambiguity*
T 1539888799 18<dbhole>	gah, sorry this is what I get for reading too fast and not in detail
T 1539888819 20<lufimtse>30	^_^, thanks for getting back to me thou. It helps to have things clarified.
T 1539888872 18<dbhole>	np! I replied back to my reply clarifying :)
T 1539888957 20<lufimtse>30	thanks. I'm thinking of writing a Red Hat devel blog post on it. In the EAP/java consulting mailing lists there are a lot of questions on Oracle -> OpenJDK migrations.
T 1539889304 18<dbhole>	oh, thats too bad that most dont get to us.. would be nice if they emailed java-project if possible
T 1539889786 20<lufimtse>30	btw. Do you know if we  prove *some kind of* support for older minor OpenJDK builds on newest RHEL7s?
T 1539889805 20<lufimtse>30	e.g if they have some kind of issue, would support at least point toward right kbs?
T 1539889811 20<lufimtse>30	or should I ping support for this question?
T 1539889826 20<lufimtse>30	by support I mean 'best effort' and not code level
T 1539889842 18<dbhole>	nope, none whatsoever.. if the issue is replicatable on latest JDK, definitely we can fix and update, but we cannot update an ollder one, we do not branch on each minor release, only tag and continue
T 1539889876 18<dbhole>	if there is an issue on an older version, the first thing we ask is to try the latest and see if it happens there.. if it does, the issue is vlosed, if it does, we investigate

T 1539889909 20<lufimtse>30	I see
T 1539890166 20<lufimtse>30	that's very helpful. Thank you.
