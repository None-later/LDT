T 1494958073 18<rgrunber>	i would probably get rid of the slide about the "Meetings". nothing that would really be shocking or a deal breaker :P

T 1494959714 20<lufimtse>30	I was thinking that also
T 1494960071 20<lufimtse>30	feel free to hack on the presentation, change stuff as you see fit. 
T 1494960082 20<lufimtse>30	A lot of the stuff was just thrown in or copied from Ian's other presentation
T 1494960090 20<lufimtse>30	E.g add stuff to Platform.ui section,
T 1494960097 20<lufimtse>30	maybe talk about the docker/container stuff that you were doing.
T 1494960125 18<rgrunber>	they won't be getting to work on it anyways.. so it really wouldn't be of value.
T 1494960152 20<lufimtse>30	It's more about what we do as a team.
T 1494960166 20<lufimtse>30	Part of it will be devoted to what they'll be doing
T 1494960174 20<lufimtse>30	but it's good for them to know what the team does in general also.
T 1494960238 18<rgrunber>	there's a lot of stuff that we'd have to mention about Sopot, Matt, Nick, etc.. so basically even with our part, there is so much that wouldn't be mentioned..
