T 1518805282 20<lufimtse>30	I like the team battle thing. I wonder if there are strategies.
T 1518805304 20<lufimtse>30	Like I was just casually floating around and maybe defend the edge if you were off edge
T 1518805306 18<hukhan>	Yeah, like at one point you actually saved me
T 1518805311 20<lufimtse>30	but there are probably more effective tactics
T 1518805322 20<lufimtse>30	you mean by the accidental forward air ha ha
T 1518805327 18<hukhan>	Yeah hahaha
T 1518805336 18<hukhan>	I was flying right, you hit me, and sent me left with a lower force
T 1518805343 20<lufimtse>30	ha ha
T 1518805344 18<hukhan>	I could save you with my bombs LOL

T 1518805644 20<lufimtse>30	comming to think of it.
T 1518805673 20<lufimtse>30	We should advertise team play more. If it catches on, it'd be interesting to view strategies on it.
T 1518805719 18<hukhan>	I definitely think it's really fun, it's just not often where we have so many playing at once
T 1518805728 18<hukhan>	although, 2v2's might be possible on a frequent basis
