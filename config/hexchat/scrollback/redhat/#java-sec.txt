T 1539878869 18<gnu_andrew18>	jerboaa: plus if you do 7.6 now, 7.7 may even be branched with those changes :)
T 1539878894 18<jerboaa18>	thoger, https://docs.prodsec.redhat.com/rhsa_creation/ mentions I'd need docs role permissions for prerequisites. how do I find out whether I have it?
T 1539878920 18<jerboaa18>	gnu_andrew, yes. thoger pointed that out
T 1539878946 18<gnu_andrew18>	jerboaa: cool, just catching up :)
T 1539878958 18<jerboaa18>	thanks anyways!
T 1539878968 18<gnu_andrew18>	jerboaa: easiest way with the erratum would probably be to just clone the OpenJDK 8 7.6 one and alter as necessary
T 1539879066 18<gnu_andrew18>	jerboaa: https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/37403
T 1539879145 18<jerboaa18>	thoger, found it: https://errata.devel.redhat.com/user/show_roles I don't have Docs
T 1539879159 18<thoger18>	jerboaa: docs role should only be required for approving docs, not writing
T 1539879188 18<jerboaa18>	thoger, so I don't need to apply for the Docs role, then?
T 1539879207 18<thoger18>	no
T 1539879213 18*	jerboaa is confused as it's listed as a prerequisite
T 1539879291 18<gnu_andrew18>	jerboaa: neither do I, should be just the same as creating other errata in this case as it's not a security one
T 1539879531 18<thoger18>	jerboaa: i think it's wrong.  it's recent(ish) change, and i'm going to ask to have that removed
T 1539879552 18<jerboaa18>	thoger, cool. thanks.
T 1539879800 18<gnu_andrew18>	yeah you need a role capable of creating errata, and we both have devel which allows that
