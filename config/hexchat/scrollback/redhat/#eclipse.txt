T 1506613194 20<lufimtse>30	rgrunber, so if they're using SWT_WEBKIT2=1, then unset that env var,
T 1506613223 18<rgrunber18>	i guess Fedora uses webkit2 by default.. (webkitgtk4) is only think i see..

T 1506613312 20<lufimtse>30	rgrunber, I'm working hard on trying to finish off the browser function return value. That should hopefully fix such issues.

T 1506614663 19<akurtakov>	lufimtse: in the past js errors were silently ignore IIRC
T 1506614670 18<akurtakov18>	so reporting them now could be the issue

T 1506614785 20<lufimtse>30	akurtakov, rgrunber hmmm... I have  to dig deeper. I'm not sure  if webkit1 supressed all errors
T 1506614842 20<lufimtse>30	akurtakov, rgrunber I could experiment with webkit2 that warns about javascript errors instead of throwing exception... will investigate.

T 1506616123 20<lufimtse>30	akurtakov, hmm, could be a corner case that I didn't expect. If I wrap the .evaluate() into a function, that should remove that error.
T 1506616142 20<lufimtse>30	akurtakov, I need to figure out how to reproduce on my system and then try my fix idea.

T 1506690967 18<scela18>	akurtakov: what it does is that, with the patch, if you provide "-showLocation" as a program argument when you start eclipse
T 1506690990 18<scela18>	akurtakov: it disables that checkbox, label and text and adds the tooltip so that if people get curious on why it's disabled
T 1506691010 18<scela18>	akurtakov: it would tell them that "hey this is controlled through program arguments now, not UI"
T 1506691027 18<scela18>	akurtakov: so to summarize, both disables and tries to add tooltip to show why it's disabled
T 1506692056 18<scela18>	akurtakov: so no tooltip for disabled widgets is by design?

T 1509529532 18<mbooth18>	vkadlcik: Yeah, I think we'll need to respin. It looks like more cases of a bug we fixed previously (CVE-2017-7525)
T 1509529600 18<vkadlcik18>	mbooth: yes, just looking at it... the curse of blacklists, they are never complete :-)
T 1509533143 18<vkadlcik18>	mbooth: please set me as QA Contact in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1507703
T 1509533182 18<vkadlcik18>	mbooth: i'm denied access to the bug, i hope this will help
T 1509533366 18<mbooth18>	vkadlcik: I am denied access to that bug too 
T 1509533376 18<vkadlcik18>	:-)
T 1509536785 18<mbooth18>	vkadlcik: I suppose we should get the go-ahead from Radek before changing the erratum
T 1509536806 18*	mbooth is not sure about the amount of rel-eng work needed
T 1509536929 18<vkadlcik18>	mbooth: probably, will you ask him?
T 1509536941 18<mbooth18>	Sure

T 1509540623 18<nboldt118>	mbooth: what's in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1506612 ? I can't access it :(
T 1509540737 18<mbooth18>	nboldt1: Ah, it's the tracker bug for the CVE -- it contains details of the exploit. Short version is: arbitrary code execution from deserialisation of json objects
T 1509540747 18<nboldt118>	in which jar(s) ?
T 1509540763 18<nboldt118>	mbooth: need to know if this impacts devstudio / jbosstools and requires a respin 
T 1509540775 18<nboldt118>	but I can't find the CVE in the wild (google had nothing) and the BZ is private
T 1509540780 18<mbooth18>	nboldt1: jackson-databind, used as part of the docker stack
T 1509540791 18<nboldt118>	well, crap. :(
T 1509540802 18<mbooth18>	nboldt1: Oh, the CVE is embargoed, so it probably is not public knowlege yet
T 1509540852 18<nboldt118>	mbooth: devstudio has com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jackson-databind_2.6.2.v20161117-2150.jar and com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jackson-datatype-guava_2.6.2.v20161117-2150.jar in target platform
T 1509540868 18<nboldt118>	presume the first jar is the problem?
T 1509540900 18<mbooth18>	Yeah, that'll be the one
T 1509540912 18<nboldt118>	so I need to unpack rh-eclipse47-jackson-databind-2.7.6-3.3.el7.noarch.rpm and get the jar out of that to replace in the TP?
T 1509540944 18<nboldt118>	if this is tagged "important" does that mean "must fix, blocker, release the hounds on the respin!" or ... "we can do this in the next release" ?
T 1509540947 18<nboldt118>	mbooth: ^
T 1509540975 18<nboldt118>	since I can't read the CVE bug I can't see how important this is for tools users
T 1509541157 18<mbooth18>	nboldt1: Well, "important" is not "critical" -- I think Radek's suggestion of 0-day erratum is an appropriate response
T 1509541208 18<nboldt118>	meaning we respin the rpm and everything upstream too, release a 11.1.1.GA, and ALSO patch and respin devsuite 2.1.1 too?
T 1509541227 18<nboldt118>	mbooth: ^ seems a lot of work in a small amount of time for a single "important" issue
T 1509541332 18<nboldt118>	mbooth: how does this CVE compare to the last one we had to fix for Jetty? https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464158
T 1509541359 18<nboldt118>	that was was deemed wontfix but we updated Jetty anyway, albeit a month later
T 1509541419 18<mbooth18>	nboldt1: I don't think that jetty problem affected Eclipse (AFAIK, there's no password protected server running)
T 1509541421 18<nboldt118>	mbooth: ^ just trying to determine how much work I and Denis need to do before EOD Friday, and how much QE time that will require, since they've already signed off and generally need two days to review
T 1509541445 18<mbooth18>	nboldt1: Sure, I can't type quickly enough, apparently :-)
T 1509541467 18<mbooth18>	nboldt1: RPM-wise, patched build is already available, we are just deciding how to ship it
T 1509541478 18<nboldt118>	if I need to rebuild the TP, respin everything on top of it, rebuild devstudio product, installer, and rpm, push that to siege to sign, retrieve it, and give QE the nod to review it, we're dangerously pushing into Monday
T 1509541489 18<nboldt118>	and I'm AFK on PTO from Sunday morning onward :)
T 1509541502 18<mbooth18>	And devstudio RPM should already use rh-eclipse47 version of jackson-databind
T 1509541592 18<nboldt118>	correct, rpm can be fixed via your fresh brew build
T 1509541621 18<mbooth18>	nboldt1: Upstream wise, I'm just trying to determine if jackson that old suffers from the problem, one sec
T 1509541624 18<nboldt118>	so then... maybe the upstream fix can wait until next release, when roland can update to a new version of the jar in Orbit?
T 1509541632 18<nboldt118>	mbooth: cool, thanks
T 1509541707 18<nboldt118>	looks like the Photon M3 build of Orbit has http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops2/S20171020092454/repository/plugins/com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jackson-databind_2.9.0.v20170920-1826.jar in it. way newer than the 2.7.6 in your brew rebuild
T 1509541756 18<nboldt118>	however the Oxygen.1a stream only has http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops2/R20170919201930/repository/plugins/com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jackson-databind_2.6.2.v20161117-2150.jar in it :(

T 1509541814 18<scela18>	omajid_wfh: you're green, does that mean that the dotnetcore issue you got blocked on is fixed?
T 1509541816 18<mbooth18>	nboldt1: It looks like all necessary patches are in upstream releases: jackson-databind-2.9.2 jackson-databind-2.9.1 jackson-databind-2.8.10 -- so probably another orbit update is warranted before photon
T 1509541827 18<scela18>	omajid_wfh: or did we settle for the workaround?

T 1509541849 18<omajid_wfh18>	scela: we found a hack/workaround. it seems to workin most user testing.

T 1509542007 18<scela18>	omajid_wfh: what kind of strange behavior?
T 1509542029 18<omajid_wfh18>	specifically, aCute doesnt seem to work well whenever i import a project
T 1509542052 18<omajid_wfh18>	i tried importing a `dotnet new mvc` project and had issues.

T 1509542077 18<omajid_wfh18>	but if i let aCute do the `dotnet new` itself things seemed to work
T 1509542083 18<omajid_wfh18>	is this i known issue?
T 1509542099 18<omajid_wfh18>	i want to make sure this isnt a bug in our "workaround"
T 1509542110 18<omajid_wfh18>	but since vscode worked, i suspect it is eclipse specific

T 1509542236 18<scela18>	omajid_wfh: while at it, you can send an email about this to eclipse-team@ and I'll make sure it's followed up
T 1509542238 18<mbooth18>	nboldt1: Hmm the original research paper says that buggy logic was only introduced in jackson 2.7.0, so upstream may be in luck
T 1509542255 18<nboldt118>	mbooth: \o/ :)
T 1509542264 18<omajid_wfh18>	scela: will do. thanks!

T 1509547080 18<mbenitez18>	mbooth, vkadlcik about the CVE, I saw Mat mentioned there's a build, how much QE test do we expect?
T 1509547094 18<mbenitez18>	I think depending on that we should go with current errata or 0-day

T 1509547391 18<mbooth18>	mbenitez: So you prefer option 1?
T 1509547635 18<mbenitez18>	mbooth, I have no preference, do you?
T 1509547652 18<mbenitez18>	optin 2 implies an extra errata but could be cleaner
T 1509547682 18<mbenitez18>	I don't know if there's a benefit for QE, rzima seemed to prefer 2)
T 1509547745 18<mbooth18>	mbenitez: Path of least resistance is fine for me :-)
T 1509547785 18<mbenitez18>	vkadlcik, any preference?
T 1509547910 18<vkadlcik18>	mbenitez: I'd prefer 1 but it's definitely riskier, so I'd accept 2

T 1509632462 18<mbenitez18>	mbooth, what's going on with the CVE?
T 1509632482 18<mbenitez18>	I saw mention of RHSCL 3.0 we wer not part of it, it's devtools
T 1509632573 18<mbooth18>	mbenitez: It was also filed against rh-eclipse46
T 1509632661 18<mbooth18>	And it seems that although rh-eclipse46 was part of rhscl-2.4, it's still shipped as part of rhscl-3 (major version bumps mean nothing, it turns out because it's all delivered through one channel)
T 1509632680 18<mbooth18>	Something I didn't fully understand
T 1509632703 18<mbooth18>	But I think I do now
T 1509632712 18<mbenitez18>	mbooth, it shouldn't have been shipped, it probably was 'ported' when rcm initialized buildroots
T 1509632767 18<mbenitez18>	rhscl-2.4 was our last release there, we need to patch
T 1509632792 18<mbenitez18>	then we moved to devtools [*-47] that we need to fix
T 1509632805 18<mbenitez18>	that should be all, 2 versions
T 1509633007 18<mbooth18>	mbenitez: Right, but my understanding now is that the fix for rh-eclipse46 should be delivered in rhscl-3 -- Tomas Hoger gave me an explanation of why this is so on https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1507830
T 1509633074 18<mbenitez18>	mbooth, I think he got that mixed, we're not part of rhscl3, we only need a zstream for 2.4
T 1509633088 18<mbenitez18>	the next version [which would have been 3.0 moved to devtools]
T 1509633095 18<mbenitez18>	I'll explain in BZ
T 1509633400 18<mbooth18>	Okay -- well I'm happy doing whatever as long as users still get the update, which I am assured they will due to there being no distinction from user POV between rhscl-2.4 and 3
T 1509633439 18<mbenitez18>	right
T 1509633500 18<mbenitez18>	mbooth, you haven't built the jackson for rh-eclipse46* yet?
T 1509633555 18<mbooth18>	mbenitez: Not yet
T 1509633601 18<mbenitez18>	ok, I've changed the bug to be 2.4.z that's the branch[es] we need
T 1509633648 18<mbenitez18>	mbooth, for the fix to 4.7 we'll create a separate errata after all since that ensures we don't affect the stage content already in place by rzima
T 1509633680 18<mbenitez18>	is there a BZ for this?
T 1509633838 18<mbooth18>	mbenitez: I think it's this one: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1507699

T 1509633926 18<mbenitez18>	I see 3 bugs for this issue, do you have the same?
T 1509634107 18<mbooth18>	For latest CVE, I see: 1507699 (against rhscl-3.1, which I assume should be against devtools-2.1) and 1507700 (against rhscl-3.0.z)
T 1509634163 18<mbooth18>	This extra one that has discussion on it: 1507830 is for previous CVE that was committed to rhscl-2.4 branch but not rhscl-3.0 branch
T 1509634235 18<mbooth18>	AIUI this bug is for bringing 3.0 branch up to same level so that fix for new CVE can be pushed as 3.0 z-stream without regression
T 1509634279 18<mbooth18>	It should be closed if we can simply push 2.4 z-stream as you say
T 1509634309 18<vkadlcik18>	it's all complicated, i'm afraid secteam tracks products (and fixes) in a different way than we think of them and that produces all the confusion
T 1509634452 18<vkadlcik18>	i'm afraid thoger will be unhappy about the reflagging in in bz1507830
T 1509634513 18<mbenitez18>	vkadlcik, I'm sending a note out now to try and clarify, trying to coordinate in BZ it's not good
T 1509634523 18<mbenitez18>	mbooth, agreed, I see the same 3
T 1509634673 18<mbenitez18>	mbooth, I agree 1507699 should be for the current release

T 1510585227 18<dbocharo18>	akurtakov: also switched to my Eclipse for RCP version, which i use for jbosstools-openshift development. And still have this problem with pop-up windows :( despite i have updated it. Version: Oxygen.1a Release (4.7.1a) Build id: 20171005-1200
T 1510585635 18<dbocharo18>	actually links in pop-ups are working, but i can't select anything, it is closing immediately. 
T 1510585655 18<dbocharo18>	maybe i need to restart my fedora after installing webkitgtk3 ?
T 1510586124 18<dbocharo18>	trying to restart. Hope it helps
T 1510586896 18<dbocharo18>	akurtakov: laptop restart didn't help. Still problem with pop-ups and tests
T 1510586933 18<akurtakov18>	dbocharo: so make sure you don't have SWT_WEBKIT2=1 enforced somehow/somewhere
T 1510586951 18<akurtakov18>	if it works in one install but not in another that's quite likely to be the cause
T 1510587010 18<dbocharo18>	it doesn't work in the first one too. Just links in the pop-ups started working. So both installs don't work properly
T 1510587039 18<dbocharo18>	but selecting text in pop-ups or resizing it fails 
T 1510587184 18<dbocharo18>	akurtakov: should i try to update to http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.8milestones ?
T 1510587209 18<akurtakov18>	dbocharo: IMHO you'll get better stability

T 1510587803 18<dbocharo18>	akurtakov: didn't help. Is there anything else i should check?
T 1510587823 18<akurtakov18>	I'm out of ideas
T 1510587841 18<dbocharo18>	except SWT_WEBKIT2. Haven't found it anywhere
T 1510587895 18<akurtakov18>	dbocharo: is this kde/gnome? wayland or x11?
T 1510587901 18<akurtakov18>	trying to get most info
