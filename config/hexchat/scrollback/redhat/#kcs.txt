T 1539873073 20<lufimtse>30	Hello. A few KB artiles need a few minor updates. Whom do I communicate this to to have the kb's updated? (I'm a consultant on site, I generally can't take the time to edit the kbs myself unfortunatley). 
T 1539873081 20<lufimtse>30	anyone knows?

T 1539873566 18<robotnik18>	sofia has 330 points of karma (rank 923)
T 1539873644 19<jawatts>	lufimtse you can add a comment or private comment at the bottom of the solution, but that is not a guarenteed response. I would suggest adding a private comment and then emailing the SBR identified in the metadata at the bottom.

T 1539874099 19<sofia>	lufimtse you can contact one of the  authors, if you click on the red pen , you will see manage versions
T 1539874115 20<lufimtse>30	sofia, ah, thank you .
T 1539874150 18<sofia18>	there you can see who last "touch" it and ask him to update it 
T 1539874167 20<lufimtse>30	sofia, btw, do you know what SBR stands for? It looks like some kind of group of people of sort. There seem to be many different SBR's: https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-62473
T 1539874321 19<sofia>	lufimtse yeah as you can see in that mojo page in support we have different groups of engineers that are working on a specific area/product
T 1539874340 20<lufimtse>30	sofia, do you know what 'SBR' stands for?
T 1539874431 19<jawatts>	lufimtse specialty based routing I believe. or skills, I can never remember.

T 1539874552 19<sofia>	lufimtse good luck with this..there are so many out there :)
T 1539875249 19<lesw>	lufimtse, sofia, jawatts, There is a bot called Doepy on #ccs that spells out acronyms. You can learn more here: https://mojo.redhat.com/groups/ccs/blog/2017/03/24/meet-dopey-your-documentation-conventions-advisor
