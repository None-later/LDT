T 1536260709 18<smooge18>	most of the reports I see on noise associated with powerline converters is that the noise coming from the computer or nearby radio speakers. This looks to be that the powerline converters are RF transmitting
T 1536260759 18<dgilbert18>	justine: Personally I'd run an ethernet cable (cat5/6) between the floors; that's something you can get done without your ISP
