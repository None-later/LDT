T 1502376490 20<lufimtse_>30	Kinda curious, what tennant issue do you have?
T 1502376807 18<clessard>	ahh sorry, i should have posted it here :) 
T 1502376837 18<clessard>	well, as mentioned, i have two new roomates who replaced the ones i signed my current lease with. theyre subleting and planned on continuing on for the comign year
T 1502377207 20<lufimtse_>30	hey
T 1502377228 20<lufimtse_>30	I think the law states 1.5% increase per year without approval from the board.
T 1502377241 20<lufimtse_>30	if more than 1.5%,then she needs approval from the board and justify why the price hike
T 1502377250 20<lufimtse_>30	Let me see if I can find sources.
T 1502377314 20<lufimtse_>30	we have: https://www.ontario.ca/page/rent-increase-guideline
T 1502377350 20<lufimtse_>30	If you have a single lease, then your roommates shouldn't matter (I think?)
T 1502377360 20<lufimtse_>30	how much %% is the 400$ increase?
T 1502377381 20<lufimtse_>30	Btw, where do you live if I may ask? Near the Eglington office or far away?
T 1502377508 18<clessard>	so im paying 1836 right now, split three ways. my numbers were a bit off. she initially said she wanted 2160 and then (since she mentioned that this is late notice) 2040 was the lowest she woudl go.
T 1502377513 18<clessard>	i live in kensington market fwiw
T 1502377518 18<clessard>	so thats quite the hike :p
T 1502377534 18<clessard>	i thought the roomate thing was strange as well.
T 1502377665 20<lufimtse_>30	I think she can only increase to 1872 at most. (this would be 2%). 
T 1502377670 20<lufimtse_>30	But consider calling: 1-416-645-8080 (in the Toronto area)
T 1502377680 20<lufimtse_>30	or email: ltb@ontario.ca
T 1502377722 20<lufimtse_>30	If she wants to impose higher rent, then you could dispute the hike and request that she get's approval.
T 1502377731 20<lufimtse_>30	but I would first become expert on this before doing so :-)
T 1502377741 18<clessard>	good call, thanks for your help :)
T 1502377851 20<lufimtse_>30	fwiw, If things go sour and you decide to move out of your current place, I've been thinking of moving into some shared accommodation (like 2 bedroom) near Eglington office. I currently rent a studio one subway station south of office. 
T 1502377923 18<clessard>	cool, thanks, ill keep it in mind :)

T 1502381183 20<lufimtse_>30	verbal you can throw out the window.
T 1502381231 18<clessard>	ill see with her. unfortunately this might be one of those situations where a slightly higher increase is worth avoidign that hassle of being in an argumetn with her ..
