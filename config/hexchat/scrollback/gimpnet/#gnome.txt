T 1513702372 20<lufimtse>30	Hello, I'm trying to tie a hotkey (e.g F1) to run a bash script (e.g ~/home/user/path/myCmd.sh ). But adding a custom shortcut doesn't seem to work. Does anyone know how to get this to work? (Fedora 27/Wayland)
T 1513702490 18<borschty18>	are you using ~ in the path? ~ is something that gets expanded by bash, but the custom commands are not launched by bash, so this won't get expanded
T 1513702743 18<peter-bittner18>	> but why do you want to run gsettings on every login?
T 1513702821 18<peter-bittner18>	I mainly need the script for the very first login (of LDAP users). But I do mount corporate NAS shares (with user permissions) on every login.
T 1513702849 20<lufimtse>30	borschty, I've tried full path, doesn't see to work either? 
T 1513702963 19<borschty>	lufimtse, can you try restarting your session after changing the command? I remember some issue with the command not being updated immediately (not sure if this has been fixed yet)
T 1513702996 20<lufimtse>30	borschty, 'r' doesn't work on wayland to restart anymore. Is logout & login enough to restart session or is there a better way?
T 1513702999 18<borschty18>	peter-bittner, in that case custom dconf profiles with modified defaults seem like the way to go
T 1513703021 19<borschty>	lufimtse, logout & login
T 1513703026 20<lufimtse>30	borschty, danke.
