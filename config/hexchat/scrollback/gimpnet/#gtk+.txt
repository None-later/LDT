I want to implement a right click handler on a flowbox, but since I wanted to make the whole thing touch-friendly, I wanted to implement it together with a "longclick" handler.
T 1517339402 18<baedert18>	gabmus[m]: GtkGestureLongPress?

T 1517340615 18<gabmus[m]18>	I am currently following this guide: https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/Gestures but it's C specific. I am using python3 and I tried to adapt it, but it doesn't work. anyone can suggest a python example?
T 1517340695 18<baedert18>	You need to keep the gesture instance around so it doesn't get freed at the end of the block you created it in
T 1517340783 18<gabmus[m]18>	it's a class attribute
T 1517340785 18<gabmus[m]18>	so I don't think it will go anywhere
T 1517340846 18<baedert18>	Does the widget you're trying to use it on have a window or are you using it on an eventbox..?
T 1517340942 18<gabmus[m]18>	The widget that has to be longpressed is a flowbox. maybe that is the problem?
T 1517340961 18<gabmus[m]18>	The app runs, it doesnt error out, so I think that I'm just missing something

T 1517341648 18<gabmus[m]18>	alright, now I need to get the child of the flowbox that's being selected. a simple way would be to actually select the child on longclick or right click. any way to do that? in the meantime, I am searching in the doc
T 1517342020 18<gabmus[m]18>	I wasn't clear: neither right clicking nor longpressing triggers the child_activated signal of the flowbox. I want to trigger this signal manually

T 1517399397 18<csoriano18>	so basically, the question was if those label can be transformed to GtkEntries so the user is allow to modify the metadata of the files

T 1517399483 18<gabmus[m]18>	right, seems legit. maybe a better (if less elegant) way of implementing this would be a separate "edit metadata" menu entry for files that opens another window different from the properties one.
T 1517399516 18<csoriano18>	gabmus[m]: yeah, we are going to do that for the disk/partitions. And that idea seems more appropiate...
T 1517399531 18<heftig18>	yeah, I think a separate editor would be best
T 1517399555 18<heftig18>	many file properties might not be editable (if just because there's no code for doing that)
T 1517399591 18<csoriano18>	right, the proposal was to only allow a few things
T 1517399599 18<csoriano18>	like song title, album, etc
T 1517399624 18<gabmus[m]18>	> only allow a few things
T 1517399624 18<gabmus[m]18>	That'd make the properties menu inconsistent
T 1517399627 18<csoriano18>	but I can see how this becomes quite complex, if you allow editing location of a picture and you want to present a map or some fancy not-gonna-happen stuff
T 1517399653 18<csoriano18>	gabmus[m]: it kinda already is, we allow to edit file permissions. For a user, that's just metadata too I think
T 1517399699 18<gabmus[m]18>	permissions are not metadata
T 1517399724 18<csoriano18>	I'm talking from an user POV

T 1517401188 18<gabmus[m]18>	ok found what causes the critical: it happens semi-randomly whenever I change the relative_to widget of the popover. never changing it and setting it relative to a widget that's always shown doesn't cause the problem at all.

T 1517506662 18<gniourf18>	thanks for the answer, I'll have to rethink this design then...
T 1517506704 18<gniourf18>	what would you suggest for this situation: I want a container and the widgets have fancy shapes, say triangular and circular. They can overlap, and they can be moved with the mouse.
T 1517506709 18<feaneron18>	gniourf: don't forget you can actually ask and discuss here how your specific problem can be solved properly :)
T 1517506712 18<feaneron18>	aha!
T 1517506716 18<feaneron18>	too late :P
T 1517506740 18<feaneron18>	do they have a z-index?
T 1517506760 18<gniourf18>	let's say they have
T 1517506788 18<feaneron18>	you can either subclass GtkOverlay (which already supports z-index, events pass through, etc)
T 1517506805 18<feaneron18>	or copy-paste GtkOverlay in your project, and make whatever changes you need
T 1517506828 18<gniourf18>	is #2 doable in Python?
T 1517506855 18<feaneron18>	i don't think so
T 1517506861 18<gniourf18>	ok, so #1 it will be
T 1517506902 18<gniourf18>	there's also #3: have the container handle everything... that's what I tried, but the thing seems awkward... do you confirm it's clumsy?
T 1517507000 18<feaneron18>	i think it makes sense that the container selects which widget will receive the event
T 1517507034 18<feaneron18>	ideally, each widget knows only about itself and maybe about its children
T 1517507076 18<feaneron18>	making the container handle everything (including what the children was supposed to handle) might be a bit... bad practice
T 1517507116 18<feaneron18>	although admittedly it might work too
T 1517507136 18<gniourf18>	yes. Thinking about it now, Overlay is a solution to consider seriously atm
T 1517507164 18<feaneron18>	the only "problem" you might find with GtkOverlay is that it does not deal with absolute positioning
T 1517507180 18<feaneron18>	which is a common practice in GTK development
T 1517507184 18<gniourf18>	is that a problem?
T 1517507208 18<feaneron18>	but for your specific case, with the limited information you gave, it makes sense to have absolute positioning?
T 1517507213 18<feaneron18>	you tell me :)
T 1517507231 18<gniourf18>	I'm sure I can deal with this
T 1517507240 18<feaneron18>	alright then
T 1517507264 18<gniourf18>	At least I'm not going to spend any more time trying to figure out how to pass events to children underneath!
T 1517507270 18<gniourf18>	so thanks for the talk :)
T 1517507285 18<feaneron18>	yup; don't hesitate to drop by if you have any trouble

T 1517584760 18<Company18>	willy: the clipboard is managed by the windowing system
T 1517584776 18<Company18>	willy: which means the X server handles itr
T 1517584820 18<Company18>	willy: and the ctrl-c shortcut is per-application and may or may not be modifiable
T 1517584877 18<mclasen18>	I think we are using command instead of control on os x ?
T 1517584901 18<mclasen18>	maybe I'm missing context
T 1517585266 18<willy18>	mclasen, correct, cmd instead of ctrl
T 1517585378 18<willy18>	Company, so, one application caught ctrl-c, and sends the content to copy to windowing system clipboard, then on other application ctrl-v get the content to paste from windowing system?
T 1517585632 18<LRN__18>	Company, how's the split going?
T 1517585655 18<LRN18>	still "meh"?
T 1517586154 18<LRN18>	though i imagine that nothing major is going to happen while FOSDEM is on
T 1517586192 18<LRN18>	or maybe it's the other way around - something major *will* happen during FOSDEM, considering the fact that the hackfest was just before
T 1517586320 18<mclasen18>	willy: more or less. the sending of the data really only happens on demand
T 1517586808 18<willy18>	uhm, and the unmodifiable per-application mapping because of bad habits of programmer with hard constant on their code?
T 1517586925 18<mclasen18>	its a pretty well-established convention
T 1517587996 18<Company18>	willy: yes, essentially
T 1517588025 18<Company18>	LRN: i'm hackfesting atm, so I have an excuse
