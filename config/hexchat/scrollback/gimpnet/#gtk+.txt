T 1510178803 18<hergertme18>	kulzen, why are you returning true from configure event? that prevents further functions from responding to the signal (and possibly the one that would propagate the change to the plug)
T 1510178829 18<hergertme18>	you probably want false, or GDK_EVENT_PROPAGATE (which is == false)

T 1510179336 18<hergertme18>	so you might check your code in the external process and see if it's handling an XConfigureEvent and updating it's size manually 
T 1510179385 18<hergertme18>	because gtk is not in control of your external process, the best we can do is say, "hey, here is your new size and position"

T 1510273300 18<dboles18>	post away, and if anyone can answer, they will
T 1510273367 18<israel18>	I am new to GTK, and have done a fair amount in FLTK which has a totally different way of doing something similar to TreeView.  In FLTK there was a method for items in the Treeview (in GTK this would be the Treeview Row) which could hide the item, is there anything similar to this in GTK+  I could find nothing in the docs
T 1510273419 18<israel18>	I know there is a removal function, but I would like to know if there is a way to simply hide it from the GUI temporarily, rather than deleting the row and then adding it again later.
T 1510273501 18<dboles18>	one thing that springs to mind is making your view show a GtkTreeModelFilter over your model, rather than the model directly
T 1510273553 18<israel18>	dboles: thanks so with that I can change the filter and yet keep the current content of the list?
T 1510273593 18<israel18>	I will look the documentation up to see if this fits my use case.  I am learning the GTK api by converting some of my FLTK programs to GTK.
T 1510273618 18<dboles18>	yeah, you can set a VisibleFunc for example: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkTreeModelFilter.html#gtk-tree-model-filter-set-visible-func
T 1510273649 18<dboles18>	the underlying model can stay the same, but you change the criteria by which its rows are shown in the TreeModelFilter, and because you make your TreeView (or whatever) show that, it shows the filtered version
T 1510273680 18<dboles18>	or you can have a column in the original model from which the FilterModel will determine visibility: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkTreeModelFilter.html#gtk-tree-model-filter-set-visible-column
T 1510273691 18<israel18>	thanks so much dboles GTK is much different so sometimes it is hard to know exactly what to look for!
T 1510273754 18<dboles18>	tell me about it! in an ideal world, i'll never have to learn another toolkit :P
T 1510273821 18<israel18>	 :D Well, I am sure the GTK API will continue to adapt as the technology continues to advance so you will probably have to continue learning GTK when GTK++ comes out :P
T 1510274194 18<israel18>	dboles: another quick question, I was told there might be something other tool than autotools on the horizon as a standard for building GTK programs do you know what this might be, or where I could look into it?  If not that is ok.

T 1510347023 18<Company18>	mclasen, garnacho: Can I remove gtk_widget_set_device_enabled() and gdk_window_set_(device_)events()?
T 1510347051 18<Company18>	in particular gtk_widget_set_device_enabled()
T 1510347076 18<mclasen18>	I have no idea what that does or why one would use it
T 1510347095 18<Company18>	it makes widget ignore input from a given device
T 1510347118 18<Company18>	by calling set_device_events(0) on widget's window
T 1510347124 18<mclasen18>	but I have a similar question: can I remove the sole occurrence of #ifdef GDK_MULTIHEAD_SAFE ? (in gtkicontheme.h)
T 1510347171 18<Company18>	I was wondering if that was still used when I found it
T 1510347198 18<Company18>	but yes, that can go
T 1510347207 18<mclasen18>	the answer is no - we removed all occurances in gdk
T 1510347219 18<mclasen18>	I think this one crept back in from the deprecated/ subdirectory
T 1510347231 18<Company18>	ideally gtk_icon_size_lookup() can go too, but I never finished that branch

T 1510348117 18<Company18>	mclasen: and that style class is set via https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gtk/gtkiconhelper.c?h=wip/otte/icon-size&id=fd16897b2aca5b03af006fac4dfae268bc582efb#n892

T 1510348240 18<Company18>	i don't remember
T 1510348265 18<Company18>	there were lots of cases where icon sizes were still used
T 1510348282 18<Company18>	like the filechooser stuff (though that's what you fixed a few days ago)
T 1510348282 18<mclasen18>	alright
T 1510348293 18<mclasen18>	I probably did, yes
T 1510348304 18<Company18>	and I think figuring out the use cases inside ui files
T 1510348348 18<Company18>	because they all still say <property name="icon-size">$X</property>
T 1510348377 18<mclasen18>	ha, you fixed simple.c
T 1510348381 18<mclasen18>	now even simpler

T 1510348404 18<Company18>	but more text I suppose
T 1510348516 18<mclasen18>	coming back to gtk_widget_set_device_enabled - I think garnacho needs to decide that
T 1510348532 18<Company18>	it's been @Since: 3.0
T 1510348564 18<Company18>	so if somebody wanted to use it, it should be existing by now ;)

T 1510349041 18<Company18>	ebassi: context: size_allocate() does a position_changed check, and if I make gtk_widget_allocate() take a matrix, I would need a comparison
T 1510349776 18<garnacho18>	Company: sounds good to remove these indeed
T 1510349838 18<garnacho18>	mclasen: could you paste somewhere those IM musings? got too late to ask you for that earlier...
T 1510349881 18<mclasen18>	garnacho: basically, should we drop immodules, and just have built-in per-platform support
T 1510349900 18<mclasen18>	surely, all the random immodules that we have in-tree are useless and unused
T 1510350099 18<Company18>	i bet they all have at least 1 user

T 1510350166 18<garnacho18>	mclasen: indeed, running random code in-app sounds overkill when we just want text back
T 1510350196 18<garnacho18>	and ibus seems to pretty much have won the race for linux
T 1510354861 18<mclasen18>	I guess I'll prepare a branch to do those removals then
