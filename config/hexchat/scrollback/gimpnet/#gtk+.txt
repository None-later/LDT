T 1524753688 18<Company18>	garnacho: I'm mostly thinking about it from a unifying-gtk-code pov
T 1524753722 18<Company18>	garnacho: because of the ENTER/MOTION/LEAVE and BEGIN/UPDATE/END machinery
T 1524753756 18<Company18>	garnacho: do we unify that or do we add another special case for DRAG_ENTER/DRAG_MOTION/DRAG_LEAVE
T 1524753808 18<Company18>	and the whole synth_crossing() part needs duplication also for FOCUS_IN/FOCUS_OUT
T 1524753852 18<Company18>	that's 3.5 cases of event sequences that need very similar machinery
T 1524753934 18<garnacho18>	Company: begin/end and enter/leave don't match semantically, and I'm not really keen on adding per touch enter/leave events to match it closer to pointers...
T 1524754035 18<garnacho18>	making the focus tracking event delivery code common, sure. It's always propagating down a widget and up another
T 1524754052 18<Company18>	yeah
T 1524754070 18<Company18>	and it'll be tricky code for the cases where the widgetry changes during the sequence
T 1524754131 18<Company18>	garnacho: what's the difference for touch? Does TOUCH_BEGIN grab the widget the touch started on?
T 1524754143 18<Company18>	and then the rest of the events go to that widget?
T 1524754197 18<garnacho18>	yup, that's what happens

T 1524754244 18<Company18>	that's actually another question I had
T 1524754255 18<Company18>	how are motion events delivered while a button is pressed?
T 1524754314 18<Company18>	because the web has :hover set on the element below the mouse pointer, no matter if there's a button pressed over another widget or not
T 1524754334 18<Company18>	which would mean ENTER/MOTION/LEAVE proceeds as normal while a button is pressed
T 1524754357 18<mclasen18>	thats just not how X works
T 1524754368 18<Company18>	we're not using X
T 1524754400 18<Company18>	with GTK4 there's no child windows anymore, so X requirements don't really matter to us
T 1524754415 18<mclasen18>	somewhat true
T 1524754424 18<Company18>	also, we're a wayland toolkit now :p
T 1524754438 18<mclasen18>	we should put that on a sticker
T 1524754467 18<garnacho18>	mclasen: the widget stack that will have the touch event propagated is per-sequence. The controllers in the widgets along the stack use the sequence for claiming purposes. eg. two sequences might have different targets, but end up claimed by a same common parent
T 1524754509 18<garnacho18>	Company: right now it locks on the implicit grab, X style
T 1524754758 18<heftig18>	pwithnall: any point adding cleanup to GParamSpec, GParamSpecClass, GObjectClass, GInitiallyUnownedClass?
T 1524754798 18<pwithnall18>	Yes to the `Class` ones; less sure about `GParamSpec` because it’s typically floating iirc
T 1524754825 18<pwithnall18>	and nobody ever constructs a `GParamSpec` for anything other than `g_object_class_install_properties()`
T 1524754851 18<pwithnall18>	but then again, it’s easy enough to add cleanup support, so ¯_(ツ)_/¯
T 1524754925 18<Company18>	can you mark globals as g_autoptr?

T 1524755855 18<Company18>	garnacho: so what the web does is not doing a grab at all
T 1524755862 18<pwithnall18>	Porting to those typically breaks ABI

T 1524755895 18<Company18>	garnacho: but the event controllers for clicks only trigger if they received a button down followed by a button up
T 1524755951 18<garnacho18>	Company: how does the source element know of the release? listening on the root elem?
T 1524755965 18<Company18>	garnacho: i didn't analyze it that far yet
T 1524755974 18<Company18>	garnacho: https://jsfiddle.net/9bm9oezd/1/
T 1524755988 18<garnacho18>	no wonder why it's so easy to have google maps stubbornly stick to the pointer then :/
T 1524755997 18<heftig18>	pwithnall: I thought it only breaks ABI if the instance struct respectively the class struct contains more than the parent struct
T 1524756002 18<Company18>	garnacho: onlick only gets triggered (for the whole tree) if the target was the same for button down and button up
T 1524756052 18<Company18>	garnacho: and up gets delivered to whatever button you release on (for any button

T 1524756095 18<Company18>	the neat thing about that approach is that it simplifies event delivery a lot
T 1524756113 18<Company18>	because you don't have to track grabs
T 1524756129 18<pwithnall18>	heftig: Yes, and that’s the case for a lot of classes in GIO (they have vfuncs defined in the class)
T 1524756131 18<Company18>	the not so neat thing is that it makes the event controllers more complicated
T 1524756138 18<ebassi18>	pwithnall: The reason why we don't use G_DECLARE in gio is because we have all the typedefs in a single header
T 1524756144 18<pwithnall18>	I would be wary about other ways of breaking ABI too

T 1524756154 18<heftig18>	pwithnall: in which case you would use G_DECLARE_DERIVABLE_TYPE so you the class struct remains under your control
T 1524756168 18<Company18>	ebassi: you can duplicate typedefs
T 1524756172 18<pwithnall18>	tl;dr: Please don’t port to G_DECLARE_* without some output from an ABI diff tool proving it’s OK

T 1524756274 18<Company18>	ebassi: because I've been using G_DECLARE() for all the paintables while redeclaring their types in the types.h headers

T 1524859357 20<lufimtse>30	mclasen, we're having some issues with re-parenting, where children have subwindows. In the past we used to use 'gtk_widget_reparent(..)' which internally also does 'gtk_widget_reparent_subwindows(..)'. But that call was deprecated in gtk3.14.  We found that if we re-parent via container(remove & add), we get the situation that later 'parent is disposed(..)' is reported by one of the reparented children's sub containers.
T 1524859372 20<lufimtse>30	is there a better way to reparent other than container(add|remove) ?
T 1524859409 18<mclasen18>	whenever you reparent like that, you need to make sure that you keep a ref across the unparent/reparent

T 1525198733 18<mclasen18>	abrt is not catching the shell crash ?
T 1525198735 18<spacekookie18>	How do I stop this?
T 1525198736 19<Company>	lufimtse: then you can run it with WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 gdb eclipse
T 1525198752 18<Company18>	spacekookie: put it in a scrolled window
T 1525198754 18<baedert18>	spacekookie: don't set left-margin/right-margin?
T 1525198816 18<spacekookie18>	baedert: Why wouldn't I set margins?
T 1525198829 18<baedert18>	Company: I wanted to do something like https://paste.xinu.at/yqj0/ to merge container nodes but the way GtkSnapshot is structured makes this rather hard.
T 1525198837 18<spacekookie18>	Or rather...I would like to have some margins
T 1525198843 18<baedert18>	spacekookie: because there's a bug in GtkTextView causing word wrapping to malfunction if you have those set
T 1525198895 20<lufimtse>30	Company, how do I run eclipse in mutter? when I fire up mutter, it shows empty
T 1525198906 20<lufimtse>30	Company, is there something I can read to educate myself on the matter?
T 1525198936 18<mclasen18>	baedert: how many nodes does that save ?
T 1525198960 20<lufimtse>30	Company, oh, never mind, just figured out your instructions above
T 1525199011 18<baedert18>	mclasen: hard to say with every widget getting its own GtkSnapshot
T 1525199015 18<Company18>	baedert: the idea is good
T 1525199032 18<Company18>	baedert: though I think it shouldn't go in collect_default(), but in append_internal()
T 1525199061 18<spacekookie18>	Company: Also, thanks! That fixed it :3
T 1525199063 18<spacekookie18>	Why though? :P
T 1525199067 18<Company18>	baedert: ie do if (type == CONTAINER_NODE) { /* throw away container node and append its children instead */ }
T 1525199069 18<mclasen18>	every widget is getting its own snapshot ?
T 1525199111 18<Company18>	mclasen: yes, because we do a custom snapshot to create the widget render node 
T 1525199120 18<Company18>	mclasen: then we cache it and append it to the parent
T 1525199134 18*	mclasen should pay more attention
T 1525199146 18<Company18>	mclasen: it's the new world of render node caching!
T 1525199166 18<mclasen18>	Clearly, I've been away for too long
T 1525199174 18<Company18>	mclasen: appending it to the parent involves adding an offset node though, so I don't think there are many gains to be had in baedert's patch
T 1525199203 18<Company18>	but there might be specific situations he's thinking about where it could be very useful
T 1525199239 18<Company18>	like, we avoid creating clip nodes if the clip is too large and just return the container node
T 1525199241 18<baedert18>	Yes I'd more like to avoid creating the container node altogether and use the parent container node instead
T 1525199249 18<Company18>	and we don't do offsets it the offset is (0, 0)
T 1525199312 18<spacekookie18>	Btw, looking at TextView, is there some way to add more margin to the start of paragraphs?
T 1525199621 18<baedert18>	Company: so does gtk_snapshot_append_node add the offset now or not?
T 1525199627 18<baedert18>	Because the code says yes
T 1525199629 18<baedert18>	and the docs say nope
T 1525199680 18<Company18>	baedert: the docs are wrong then
T 1525199703 18<Company18>	baedert: append_node adds an offset node and then calls append_internal() which does not add the offset
T 1525199727 18<baedert18>	so in gtk we do get_offset + append_node_internal? why>
T 1525199728 18<baedert18>	?
T 1525199758 18<Company18>	what do you mean "in gtk"?
T 1525199781 18<baedert18>	like in gtkrenderborder.c
T 1525199820 18<Company18>	(a) because that code is older than offset nodes
T 1525199821 18<baedert18>	where's the difference between append_node and manually adding the offset to the border outline? Less offset nodes?
T 1525199828 18<Company18>	(b) because it avoids an offset node
T 1525199889 18<Company18>	offset nodes were just meant as a workaround to allow caching of nodes
T 1525199923 18<Company18>	in theory we could remove all x,y coordinates from all render noes and just use offset nodes everywhere
T 1525199955 18<Company18>	i don't think that's a good approach in practice though
T 1525200942 18<baedert18>	off
T 1525200945 18<baedert18>	*orr
T 1525201018 18<baedert18>	oh FFS I thought snapshot_new_child was still a thing
T 1525201282 18<baedert18>	mclasen: in tests/testentryicons, we save ~30 nodes
T 1525201303 18<baedert18>	widget-factory page1 between 65 and 300
T 1525202325 18<Company18>	mclasen: do we have any plans with turning GdkEvent into a real GObject
T 1525202326 18<Company18>	?
T 1525202344 18<mclasen18>	you mean, beyond doing that ?
T 1525202352 18<Company18>	with subclasses
T 1525202369 18<Company18>	ie having a real GdkMotionEvent subclass
T 1525202411 18<mclasen18>	I guess we could do that
T 1525202420 18<Company18>	it's a good idea on one hand
T 1525202434 18<Company18>	because then we can have functions like gdk_drag_event_get_drag_context()
T 1525202444 18<baedert18>	it's garnacho territory so it would be GdkEventMotion :P
T 1525202451 18<Company18>	instead of all those getters returning FALSE if you pass the wrong type of event
T 1525202461 18<mclasen18>	yeah, the getters are awkward
T 1525202471 18<Company18>	otoh there's a bunch of overlap
T 1525202481 18<Company18>	like, get_coords() works on motion and button events
T 1525202516 18<ebassi_18>	Unless you make a PointerEvent and then inherit from it
T 1525202529 18<Company18>	right
T 1525202539 18<Company18>	a side effect is that we could also have proper constructors
T 1525202545 18<ebassi_18>	But there's always the risk of getting the hierarchy wrong
T 1525202550 18<Company18>	gdk_drag_event_new()
T 1525202568 18<ebassi_18>	Dunno about that; unless you mean private event constructors
T 1525202583 18<Company18>	instead of event = gdk_event_new (); event.type = DRAG_MOTION; event.poke_random_member = foo;
T 1525202589 18<ebassi_18>	I haven't seen many legitimate cases for out of tree event instances
T 1525202591 18<Company18>	yes, I mean private ones
T 1525202599 18<ebassi_18>	Right
T 1525202611 18<Company18>	i'm running into cases a lot where backends do weird stuff
T 1525202618 18<ebassi_18>	For those cases, having a gdk_create_drag_event() would also work
T 1525202621 18<mclasen18>	yeah, should all be private, I think ?
T 1525202624 18<Company18>	not just with events, but with all sorts of objects
T 1525202651 18<Company18>	which is why GdkClipboard (and soon GdkDrag and GdkDrop) have a private struct
T 1525202669 18<Company18>	GdkDrawContext and subclasses do, too
T 1525202697 18<Company18>	so that gdkglcontext-x11.c doesn't just do some "neat trick" by setting context->surface to a magic value
T 1525202735 18<Company18>	and then i refactor things in gdk/gdkglcontext.c and suddenly everything explodes, but only on X11
T 1525202769 18<Company18>	in this case I asked because I was thinking about vfuncs
T 1525202787 18<garnacho18>	I FWIW experimented with a nested hierarchy of structs (not objects) in mechane, and it 1) got really ugly to name a few of those intermediate ones 2) I had to shove some things in upper structs to avoid redefining them in multiple children
T 1525202790 18<Company18>	because we have this awkward gdk_drag_context_handle_source_event()/handle_dest_event() setup
T 1525202882 18<Company18>	garnacho: I would have gone the dumb route of just splitting up the union we have into all its subelements
T 1525202908 18<Company18>	garnacho: the question is how many getters remain that work across multiple of those
T 1525202986 18<Company18>	we could just keep the overlapping getters on GdkEvent and have them as vfuncs or so
T 1525203005 18<Company18>	just call GDK_EVENT_GET_CLASS (entry)->get_coords()
T 1525203073 18<Company18>	lol

T 1525203208 18<Company18>	also, we still have a bunch of APIs that take a const GdkEvent
T 1525203221 18<Company18>	I suppose they should lose their constness because objects are never const?
