T 1486543785 18<TheMuso18>	joanie: From a code implementation POV a11y wise, yeah GTK 2 can die as far as I'm concerned too.
T 1486543799 18<joanie18>	:)
T 1486543964 18<TheMuso18>	Ok not sure if this was tried, but I get the same behavior when opening a menu with the mouse as well.
T 1486543984 18<TheMuso18>	So I don't think it has anything to do with the keyboard grab code, but of course that makes sense really.
T 1486560407 18<joanie18>	TheMuso and or b4n: Take a look at the mate-panel applets using accerciser.
T 1486560427 18<joanie18>	there is nothing connecting applets to the panel
T 1486560438 18<joanie18>	no parent-child relationship
T 1486560459 18<joanie18>	no alternate accessible relation type
T 1486560472 18<joanie18>	applets are their own applications and lack children
T 1486560482 18<joanie18>	like the entry of the dictionary applet
T 1486560510 18<joanie18>	those absent children emit events, mind you
T 1486560538 18<joanie18>	you just cannot locate them from the top down (i.e. in Accerciser's tree of accessibles)
T 1486560586 18<joanie18>	b4n: addressing those sorts of issues should be done in mate-panel and/or its applets and NOT through sad Orca hacks that make me cry ;)
T 1486560633 18<joanie18>	so if you have spare time to try to make mate-panel suck less, focusing on the non-Orca side of a fix or hack would be the way to go
T 1486563066 18<b4n18>	joanie: yes, applets should likely be tied with the panel through AtkSocket/AtkPlug
T 1486563091 18<b4n18>	or mate-panel should stop having those as separate apps as their current sutff only works under X anyway

T 1486563337 18<b4n18>	not sure I'll have time for that one "soon" as it seems not trivial, but I'll keep it in mind if no one else beats me to it (:wink: to anyone interested)
T 1486585502 18<TheMuso18>	b4n: Yeah, as much as having them as separate executables may bring some protectino to the panel, maybe it needs to be a plugin interface using libpeas, which can still allow people to write applets in python/any GObject introspection compatible language.
T 1486585516 18<TheMuso18>	Which should work going forward in the wayland world.
T 1486629441 18<b4n18>	TheMuso: IIUC that's already working, and they support in-process applets too, just that they prefer the external ones.  but yeah they probably need changing something if they don't wanna get stuck to X forever

T 1491476046 18<mclasen18>	so I am coming to the conclusion that we can't allow the a11y bus into sandboxes at all, with the current state of affairs
T 1491476228 18<TheMuso18>	No idea on whether anybody else has tested a11y with flatpack GTK apps. I certainly haven't so this doesn't surprise me.
T 1491476243 18<mclasen18>	its not about flatpak at all
T 1491476263 18<mclasen18>	just about allowing everybody to inject unvalidated command into everybody else
T 1491476274 18<TheMuso18>	Oh right.
T 1491476368 18<mclasen18>	my simpleminded idea before this experiment was that maybe this needs to be split into a 'sendkeys' interface on the AT / registry side that sandboxed apps would be allowed to talk to, and an 'injectcommands' interface that they expose, but can't talk to
T 1491476432 18<mclasen18>	but there's too many layers here for me to say how feasible this is
T 1491476447 18<TheMuso18>	If you are talking about keyboard/mouse input specifically, then there is actually work needing to be done there indeed.
T 1491476467 18<mclasen18>	that is the only thing that apps need to actively send out over the bus, right ?
T 1491476529 18<TheMuso18>	Well, there is a couple of things I think. There is the atk/at-spi action API/object, and then there is tools like orca needing to intercept input events to allow the user to execute keyboard shortcuts to control Orca.
T 1491476555 18<mclasen18>	it would be nicer if ATs could get their input interception done at the compositor 
T 1491476573 18<TheMuso18>	Yep, GTK currently does the work now.
T 1491476578 18<mclasen18>	but thats a bit complementary
T 1491476595 18<TheMuso18>	Funny you should say that, I've been looking into what is needed spec wise to coordinate and coolaborate on getting such a thing into the comositor.
T 1491476611 18<mclasen18>	we're in the same spot with input methods:
T 1491476618 18<TheMuso18>	Right.
T 1491476634 18<mclasen18>	would be nice to do compositor-side (text protocol) but we're using the client-side ibus approach just fine for now
T 1491476643 18<mclasen18>	and unsurprisingly, it has a similar issue with sandboxes
T 1491476649 18<TheMuso18>	I was needing to look into this for Unity 8... Even though that is no longer a thing, the work still needs doing.
T 1491476671 18<mclasen18>	but a bit more manageable, since there's not 'inject arbitrary commands' api that goes with it
T 1491476698 18<TheMuso18>	Orca via at-spi using X also controls the mouse pointer, which again is something needing to be done with the compositor.
T 1491476741 18<mclasen18>	yeah, that calls for a privileged DeviceEventController api in the compositor
T 1491476782 18<TheMuso18>	Right. Down the road, Orca will also want to intercept touch events too.
T 1491476813 18<TheMuso18>	At least I think it will.
T 1491476816 18<TheMuso18>	Others may disagree.
T 1491476868 18<mclasen18>	I would be happy to find a solution that makes actual screen reading work in sandboxes
T 1491476881 18<mclasen18>	no need to go all in, some things in orca may just not be a good idea...
T 1491476990 18<TheMuso18>	Right, I need to better familiarize myself with this I guess.
T 1491478500 18<mclasen18>	as always I come away thinking a simple client-side 'call out to pulseaudio' solution would get us 80% of the way for screen reading :-(
T 1491478568 18<TheMuso18>	Well Orca uses speech-dispatcher, which in turn uses pulseaudio.
T 1491478639 18<mclasen18>	I'm just pining for the simplicitly of 'no bus, no abstraction, no mess'

T 1492676114 18<alexarnaud18>	Hello joanie, have done something special to support Google Doc? We try to have focus tracking with Compiz and Ezoom on it but it makes us crazy because of we think non-standard AT-SPI events. If you have any information on that we really appreciate it. :)
T 1492676114 18<alexarnaud18>	Thanks in advance.
T 1492676539 18<joanie18>	alexarnaud: Google docs accessibility works via a complex ARIA liveregion hack done by Google. Orca has ARIA liveregion support. My guess is that your magnifiers don't.
T 1492676610 18<joanie18>	But this is, presumably, also an issue for other platforms. So maybe Google Docs has additional support for magnifiers.
T 1492676638 18<joanie18>	Were I you, I'd figure out how Windows users with low vision use Google Docs with their magnifiers.
T 1492681146 18<alexarnaud18>	joanie: thank you very much for the precision
T 1492690160 18<alexarnaud18>	joanie: is the aria liveregion events come from FIrefox to AT-SPI2?
T 1492690199 18<joanie18>	alexarnaud: need to walk away now, but yes
T 1492690210 18<joanie18>	or really they come from google docs to Gecko
T 1492690221 18<joanie18>	and from there to AT-SPI2

T 1493037652 18<ksamak18>	joanie: hi, i'm working on compiz's zoom/focus tracking, and i'm kinda at a loss on one point, if you had a couple minutes, i'd be glad to ask you a couple questions
T 1493037683 18<ksamak18>	i'm trying to get the aria live regions working in compiz, in order to make sense of google docs for the tracking.
T 1493037694 18<joanie18>	good luck! :)
T 1493037704 18<ksamak18>	yeah, i know...
T 1493037715 18<ksamak18>	i had a look in orca, but i can't really find the entry points from libatspi to get these info
T 1493037716 18<joanie18>	I just know about its use of live regions for screen reader support
T 1493037727 18<joanie18>	and what google docs does is tell screen readers what to say
T 1493037757 18<joanie18>	i.e. you move to the next line and google docs gives the screen reader the text of that line
T 1493037758 18<ksamak18>	joanie: you think it works just because gdocs thought about screen readers, but not magnifiers?
T 1493037772 18<joanie18>	not as something with navigable, accessible text
T 1493037776 18<joanie18>	ksamak: I dunno
T 1493037784 18<joanie18>	what I told alexarnaud and what I'll tell you is this:
T 1493037787 18<ksamak18>	mmmm, that's pretty bad
T 1493037805 18<joanie18>	Presumably this is something Windows and Mac magnifier users have encountered
T 1493037808 18<joanie18>	What do they do?
T 1493037811 18<joanie18>	Does it work?
T 1493037828 18<joanie18>	If it works in those platforms, there must be something additional google docs is doing for magnification users
T 1493037842 18<joanie18>	if it doesn't work in those platforms, you likely won't get it working in ours
T 1493037849 18<ksamak18>	yeah, but my only backend in atspi anyway, so i'm trying to contentrate on getting the most of it
T 1493037851 18<joanie18>	that's all I can tell you. Sorry!
T 1493037870 18<ksamak18>	ok, so nothing special from orca, it just get these lines of text.
T 1493037882 18<joanie18>	it gets stuff to say
T 1493037884 18<ksamak18>	no special api, no special treatment of some events
T 1493037889 18<ksamak18>	ok then
T 1493037890 18<joanie18>	it takes it and speaks it
T 1493037892 18<joanie18>	unmodified
T 1493037927 18<joanie18>	and that's not just for the editor. it's for menu selection changes, toolbar focus changes, the whole. freakin'. interface.
T 1493037943 18<joanie18>	gotta run now.
T 1493037947 18<ksamak18>	orca doesn't have fine grain, like i'm on the "a" right now, or "this word is hilighted"
T 1493037954 18<ksamak18>	joanie: ok, thanks for the insight
T 1493037969 18*	ksamak is gonna try and get some luck somewhere
T 1493037979 18<joanie18>	if you arrow to the "a" in a document, google docs emits a live region event with the string "a"
T 1493037990 18<joanie18>	google docs has its own commands for screen readers
T 1493037999 18<joanie18>	Orca just spews out what google docs gives it
T 1493038000 18<ksamak18>	yeah, the question is how can i get this event, i can't find this
T 1493038021 18<joanie18>	they are text-changed and/or object:children-changed events
T 1493038030 18<joanie18>	register for them
T 1493038035 18<joanie18>	see what gets spewed out
T 1493038037 18<ksamak18>	ok, maybe i'm not looking hard enough on the children changed
T 1493038056 18<joanie18>	the event.any_data is the child
T 1493038059 18<ksamak18>	i got the text objects, but they don't follow at-spi standart...
T 1493038061 18<joanie18>	see what it exposes
T 1493038076 18<ksamak18>	at least the text-changed doesn't
T 1493038082 18<ksamak18>	thank, ill look harder
T 1493038091 18<joanie18>	it's ATK, but again this is a serious hack done by google; not actual text objects.
T 1493038101 18<joanie18>	good luck!
T 1493038131 18<ksamak18>	thanks. i know, i'm already making recursions all over the place to get out of this weird heirarchy and find the right objects...
T 1493038457 18<alexarnaud18>	hum, I don't see anything specific for screen magnifiers.
T 1493038496 18<alexarnaud18>	I don't know if ZoomText is able to work with Google Doc due I have only Compiz to test.

At Hypra, We are looking on FIrefox bugs specific to Linux to make it fix by the a11y team or by developers paid by Hypra but we have difficulties to understand and to determine how many workaround you have  done into Orca and if bugs are not reported on the Mozilla BTS. For example,this one : https://mail.gnome.org/archives/orca-list/2017-March/msg00054.html , is it reported upstream ?

T 1497967200 18<alexarnaud18>	If you prefer I could send you an e-mail but we really want to collaborate with you but it's harder for us to understand Mozilla related bugs than we do in other apps.

It's a major issue for users. We really try to make users as efficient as in Windows with NVDA. Blind persons have also lot of difficulties with their disability so they want (and I understand) to be efficient on their computer.
