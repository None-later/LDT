T 1511771810 18<lolek18>	infapi00: hello, got a moment for a - hope so - quick conv? It's regarding additional property we've talked some time ago
T 1511790046 18<lolek18>	infapi00: ^^?
T 1511790079 18<infapi0018>	lolek, ups sorry, I missed your ping before
T 1511790085 18<lolek18>	:D
T 1511790086 18<lolek18>	no prob
T 1511790091 18<lolek18>	do you have a moment now?
T 1511790091 18<infapi0018>	in any case, I have time as far as is "quick"
T 1511790097 18<lolek18>	well ok 
T 1511790100 18<lolek18>	so first a recall
T 1511790122 18<lolek18>	a button if I recall properly
T 1511790127 18<lolek18>	erm no
T 1511790129 18<lolek18>	a notebookpagetab
T 1511790130 18<lolek18>	sorry
T 1511790146 18<lolek18>	when you set a acc name you get the name, but when you don't set it, you'll get a label text
T 1511790147 18<lolek18>	right?
T 1511790185 18<lolek18>	infapi00: ^
T 1511790206 18<lolek18>	so if you remember this, is seems that the same "problem" is with the menuitem
T 1511790213 18<lolek18>	you either can get acc name or the text
T 1511790216 18<lolek18>	y ou can't access both
T 1511790236 18<lolek18>	so it seems this is a gtk limitation 
T 1511790254 18<lolek18>	and it would be good to have some solution for it
T 1511790276 18<lolek18>	a two possibilities come to my head
T 1511790323 18<lolek18>	1st: add new property called title or caption, that will provide the text visible to the user while acc_name will be for acc 
T 1511790323 18<lolek18>	2nd: use text interface to provide the missing info as it's for the label
T 1511790363 18<lolek18>	with the ifrst approach the api will change which may not be a good idea, with the second option, the api will stay the same with even possible backport to older 3.x versions 
T 1511790406 18<infapi0018>	 probably Im missing details
T 1511790414 18<infapi0018>	but my first thought with option 2
T 1511790425 18<infapi0018>	if I understand it properly
T 1511790435 18<infapi0018>	the name will have some text
T 1511790440 18<infapi0018>	and the text will have a different one, right?
T 1511790596 18<lolek18>	yeah
T 1511790619 18<infapi0018>	infapi00, well, although Im talking just using my memory
T 1511790623 18<infapi0018>	that can be confusing
T 1511790628 18<infapi0018>	for example, with a gtklabel
T 1511790629 18<lolek18>	yes I understand it
T 1511790636 18<infapi0018>	both the name and the text from atktext are the same
T 1511790638 18<lolek18>	well label works like this I think, let me check src
T 1511790649 18<infapi0018>	atktext is basically a sugar-friendly way to get the text
T 1511790674 18<infapi0018>	oh well, true there is a corner case
T 1511790683 18<infapi0018>	if the user sets manually a name
T 1511790690 18<lolek18>	well ok, just checked label and no label works properly :)
T 1511790691 18<infapi0018>	then in that case, label name and label text can be different
T 1511790698 18<lolek18>	I've got here a label with acc name, acc description
T 1511790708 18<lolek18>	and when I get the acc_name it's different than the text
T 1511790710 18<lolek18>	so it's ok
T 1511790736 18<lolek18>	ok so I'll try to make a patch for menuitem
T 1511790743 18<lolek18>	just need some idea from you
T 1511790756 18<lolek18>	can you take a look at the source of the a11y/gtklabel...?
T 1511790763 18<lolek18>	there's a func gtk_label_accessible_get_run_attributes
T 1511790783 18<lolek18>	the thing is that it's getting the properties from the pango layout... but menu_item doesn't have any
T 1511790792 18<lolek18>	I'd have to get menuitem parent and calculate it somehow
T 1511790924 18<infapi0018>	hmm, ok, but now Im lost
T 1511790938 18<infapi0018>	before you were talking about the pagenotebook
T 1511790947 18<infapi0018>	lolek, but what happens with menuitem?
T 1511790964 18<lolek18>	erm could be I did confuse you
T 1511790969 18<lolek18>	ok so the label works properly
T 1511790977 18<infapi0018>	or in other words, why you would be interested on a menuitem having an accessible name and a different accessible text?
T 1511790995 18<lolek18>	cause I can set two different things there
T 1511791031 18<lolek18>	but let's say I've got an app that's translated
T 1511791059 18<lolek18>	acc name will be always the same while the text on it will be translated so can be in different lang ununderstandable for me
T 1511791110 18<lolek18>	but as I said, this is just an example
T 1511791128 18<infapi0018>	but shouldn't the acc name be translated too?
T 1511791141 18<lolek18>	no
T 1511791144 18<infapi0018>	I assumed that a user would expect their name translated
T 1511791148 18<infapi0018>	unless you are talking
T 1511791153 18<infapi0018>	about automatic testing case
T 1511791163 18<lolek18>	yeah that can be another example
T 1511791172 18<lolek18>	ewen better than mine
T 1511791217 18<infapi0018>	well, but lets forget about automatic testing for now
T 1511791230 18<infapi0018>	in what case you don't want the accessible name of a menu item translated?
T 1511791234 18<lolek18>	nah, it's better example
T 1511791241 18<lolek18>	let's focus on it
T 1511791249 18<lolek18>	dogtail is using that
T 1511791263 18<lolek18>	so yeah you can't get the menu item text if you set the acc name
T 1511791267 18<lolek18>	so you can't test it
T 1511791353 18<infapi0018>	yes, I get that, you would be forced to test always in the default language
T 1511791360 18<infapi0018>	but Im still curious about a non-testing use case
T 1511791447 18<lolek18>	honestly right now I can't give you anything else out of my head
T 1511791634 18<infapi0018>	well, I think that automatic testing support is secondary (curious as my first step on atk was through dogtail)
T 1511791640 18<infapi0018>	in any case, I will take a look
T 1511791657 18<infapi0018>	just in case there are more stuff 
T 1511791664 18<infapi0018>	created just for automatic testing
T 1511791858 18<infapi0018>	lolek, having said so, I need to disconnect now, as I said, it needed to be a sort chat

It also includes proper authoring.
