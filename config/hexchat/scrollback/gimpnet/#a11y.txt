T 1482312987 18<b4n18>	FWIW landegav` tells me he's very happy with the result
T 1482313027 18<b4n18>	I'm absolutely not sure about the implementation here, but the idea would be just ignoring the events to the typeahead search entry
T 1482313095 18<b4n18>	I've got the little sister of that patch for GTK3 too, but it removes some of your previous work on that area (as it again just ignores the typeahead instead of trying and be clever about it)
T 1482313228 18<landegave18>	I confirm that I'm satisfied. All of our users are disturbed by the verbose on the desktop. The aim is to find fastly an icon.
T 1482313594 18<joanie18>	b4n: I'll look later. But ignoring all events sounds like a bad idea.
T 1482313622 18<joanie18>	but since hypra has it's own distro you can maintain that solution in your version of Orca.

T 1482313746 18<b4n18>	yeah I figured you'd say that about ignoring the events :)  I let landegave argue about why he feels presenting the text field is also noise
T 1482313788 18<b4n18>	and yeah we can probably patch on our end, but it's better if we can come up with a solution everyone is happy about that everyone can have

T 1482313807 18<joanie18>	sure
T 1482313822 18<joanie18>	but if I thought ignoring all events was a good idea, I would have ignored all events

T 1484913508 18<alexarnaud18>	joanie: Hello :) ! Do you prefer I report bugs on the bugzilla? Do you have seen the three bug I have reported about Icedove (maybe also Thunderbird)? I really think it's important issue that it would be really cool to fix them before the 3.24 release.
T 1484915788 18<joanie18>	alexarnaud: I saw the emails. Those are sufficient. But I don't use icedove and would always like a debug.out for those sorts of matters anyway. I've since responded to your emails. Apologies for not doing so yesterday, but I wanted to finish the landmark-related context work.
T 1484915826 18<joanie18>	Lastly, I am preparing for overseas travel today. I will look as soon as possible to the output you provide. TTYL.
T 1484915890 18<alexarnaud18>	joanie: No problem. I'm not totally sure but it could be really possible that the issue I have reported are the same on Thunderbird.
T 1484915926 18<alexarnaud18>	thanks a lot for the great work you provide :) !
T 1484915949 18<alexarnaud18>	I love the new feature about the announcement of list, quote etc :).
T 1484916152 18<joanie18>	alexarnaud: It would be helpful if you could see if they are the same on Thunderbird.
T 1484916183 18<joanie18>	And I'm glad you like the new feature. :)
T 1484916207 18<joanie18>	There shall be more (like the font and formatting stuff for proofreading)
T 1484916234 18<joanie18>	Hopefully within a couple of weeks. Though it depends on other stuff on my plate and deadlines and the like.
T 1484916239 18<alexarnaud18>	joanie: why the mouse review feature requires GTK 3.20?
T 1484916271 18<joanie18>	because fixing some bugs was accomplished by taking advantage of some stuff in Gdk
T 1484916302 18<joanie18>	And officially Orca 3.x is supported only in GNOME 3.x
T 1484916314 18<joanie18>	I do my best to keep things backwards compatible
T 1484916336 18<joanie18>	but I cannot maintain lots of different versions of Orca
T 1484916343 18<alexarnaud18>	OK, I'll try to test with Thunderbird. I will especially in the future try to make Icedove replaced by Thunderbird into Debian like it is the case for Firefox.
T 1484916362 18<joanie18>	and to be honest, when I fixed the mouse review stuff, I discovered it was so broken that clearly no one was using it at all
T 1484916394 18<joanie18>	so I didn't feel especially guilty for requiring a version of GTK that was recent -- but not even current at that time.
T 1484916421 18<joanie18>	People who MUST have mouse review should consider upgrading to a more current version of GNOME ;)
T 1484916432 18<alexarnaud18>	joanie: The only reason why no people use this feature as we see in Hypra is because it is as usable as in NVDA.
T 1484916456 18<joanie18>	I don't get what you just said
T 1484916520 18<alexarnaud18>	joanie: GNOME is not the best a11y environment for the low-vision people. Compiz are more powerful than the built-in GNOME Magnifier.
T 1484916559 18<joanie18>	ok, lemme rephrase. A current GNOME or MATE environment
T 1484916574 18<joanie18>	assuming the distros are using GTK 3.0
T 1484916579 18<alexarnaud18>	joanie: I really want to help you to fix mouse review stuff but I'm using Debian 8.7 so GTK 3.14.
T 1484916583 18<joanie18>	for instance Fedora 25 MATE spin would work
T 1484916599 18<joanie18>	alexarnaud: the mouse review stuff is, I believe, fixed
T 1484916614 18<joanie18>	have you tried it with GTK 3.20 or later?
T 1484916672 18<alexarnaud18>	joanie: unfortunately I've not try it on modern platform.
T 1484916691 18<joanie18>	Ok. If you try it on a modern platform and find it is broken, please let me know.
T 1484916711 18<alexarnaud18>	OK :), thanks so much !!!!
T 1484916734 18<joanie18>	OK, really walking away from my computer now. I'm not good at not working. ;)

T 1484916776 18<alexarnaud18>	joanie: Yeah, It will be a really pleasure as usual.
T 1484916796 18<alexarnaud18>	joanie: As you could see b4n works a lot to fix mate a11y stuff.

T 1486485592 18<b4n18>	joanie: yes.  and I got 2 times where it cutoff the menu speech Firefox-like (before your fix)
T 1486485613 18<joanie18>	so this seems to be a bug in the old MATE panel
T 1486485634 18<joanie18>	The firefox issue was something I saw
T 1486485677 18<b4n18>	well, the fact the window is announced probably comes from the X grabs/ungrabs that happens when hitting Alt+F1
T 1486485691 18<b4n18>	why the menu doesn't take over though I don't know
T 1486485719 18<joanie18>	but I don't see sanity checking window events across the board in Orca master in order to work around a bug in an old version of mate-panel

T 1486485770 18<b4n18>	but if you give me a moment, I can try mate-panel 1.16 GTK2 on the old thing
T 1486485783 18<joanie18>	ok
T 1486486293 18<b4n18>	1.16/GTK2 doesn't help
T 1486486319 18*	joanie sighs
T 1486486332 18<joanie18>	and the problem is fixed for firefox?
T 1486486357 18<b4n18>	yes
T 1486486382 18<joanie18>	and why can't the Gtk+ issue be fixed in Gtk+ ?
T 1486486403 18<b4n18>	wait.
T 1486486406 18<joanie18>	because it still means sanity checking events across the board
T 1486486430 18<joanie18>	just in case people are using MATE with Gtk+ 2
T 1486486445 18<joanie18>	when a lot of users aren't using mate and if they are have hopefully switched to Gtk+ 3
T 1486486489 18<b4n18>	joanie: it *might* be possibel to somehow filter those events from the a11y part, but it might miss some legitmiate onew then IIUC
T 1486486521 18<joanie18>	b4n: making the change / doing the filtering where?
T 1486486530 18<b4n18>	yes
T 1486486542 18<joanie18>	yes what?
T 1486486559 18<b4n18>	that filtering on GTK side might cause problesm too
T 1486486585 18<joanie18>	so in Gtk+ 2, correct?
T 1486486591 18<b4n18>	those extra events are emitted during an X grab, and if the active window changes during it, it would get ignored
T 1486486605 18<b4n18>	joanie: AFAIK there's the very same issue in GTK3
T 1486486637 18<joanie18>	but are you seeing this problem with mate-panel Gtk+ 3?

T 1486486712 18<joanie18>	but check some other app
T 1486486874 18<b4n18>	joanie: I don't know why it works on my GTK3 box

T 1486486979 18<b4n18>	the same setup as I had all along, the one where the language change fixed it further
T 1486487054 18<joanie18>	So if I'm understanding you correctly, you're asking me to attempt to sanity check window-activation related events coming from all apps and toolkits for all users
T 1486487076 18<joanie18>	in order to address a problem which only occurs if the user is using MATE panel built with Gtk+ 2

T 1486487110 18<joanie18>	I would suggest you fix that downstream
T 1486487123 18<b4n18>	actually I don't understand why Orca isn't stopping the speach from the activate/deactivate events although another app is focused
T 1486487142 18<b4n18>	(the panel)
T 1486487194 18<joanie18>	probably because we don't normally see bogus events like that?

T 1486487255 18<joanie18>	Orca isn't doing anything special for mate-panel

T 1486487470 18<b4n18>	shouldnt the fact that the panel gets focused shut up the other app (e.g. the terminal)?
T 1486487484 18<b4n18>	I'm literally hearing the whole announce of the current app
T 1486487493 18<b4n18>	it's not cut off or anything
T 1486487494 18<joanie18>	because of the window:activate event
T 1486487501 18<joanie18>	?
T 1486487502 18<b4n18>	and then, after all that, I get the announce of the menu
T 1486487548 18<b4n18>	my point is, shouldn't one of those be cut off by the other becoming the ative one?
T 1486487573 18<joanie18>	probably
T 1486487629 18<joanie18>	but Orca deliberately doesn't interrupt speech if a window was recently activated
T 1486487639 18<joanie18>	because then it won't present the new window
T 1486487661 18<b4n18>	oh
T 1486487765 18<b4n18>	joanie: well I don't know, but in my GTK3 logs I see the very same window deactivate/activate events
T 1486487774 18<b4n18>	yet it's not a problem apparently
T 1486487807 18<joanie18>	is the behavior with mate-panel built with Gtk+ 3 fixed?

T 1486488434 18<b4n18>	joanie: mate-panel 1.16/GTK3 doen't magically fix it
T 1486488470 18<b4n18>	it feels like it happens slightly less often, but it's highly random
T 1486488471 18<joanie18>	so before you were not seeing the problem and now you are?
T 1486488494 18<joanie18>	because before my changes I was seeing the problem and now I am not

T 1486488540 18<b4n18>	no no I'm talking about putting a MATE 1.16 GTK3 panel on Debian Jessie, which has otherwise MATE 1.8
T 1486488564 18<b4n18>	behavior on my Debian Sid box is still good
T 1486488605 18<joanie18>	so what's up with Debian Jessie then?
T 1486488632 18<joanie18>	and why is it my job to fix it in Orca?
T 1486488640 18<joanie18>	s/fix/"fix"/
T 1486488682 18<b4n18>	when I hit Alt+F1 on that Debian Jessie (with orca master obviously), it often announces the current window before announcing the menu
T 1486488759 18<joanie18>	what I meant with "what's up with Debian Jessie then?" is what condition is present in Debian Jessie that might be responsible for it not working there?
T 1486488774 18<b4n18>	whether it's your job or not I don't know, and don't mean to force it upon you.  But I don't think the events are tremendously different from the ones I get on my Sid box where it does work
T 1486488808 18<b4n18>	joanie: ah.  I have no clue what's so different.  It has GTK2 everything, maybe that's the main difference
T 1486488857 18<joanie18>	and you have the latest ATK? Or at least a newer one?
T 1486488872 18<joanie18>	I think that some event filtering was done in ATK a year or two ago
T 1486488889 18<joanie18>	and there have been various and sundry fixes in AT-SPI2
T 1486488937 18<b4n18>	I probably have olde ones.  ATK 2.14
T 1486488937 18<joanie18>	and even if I did sanity check everything for Debian Jessie, if that's stable Debian, they won't be including the current Orca, right?
T 1486488950 18<joanie18>	yikes
T 1486488975 18<b4n18>	no indeed they won't.  If it's really specific to Jessie you probably don't really care yourself
T 1486488989 18<joanie18>	If things are good for a recent environment (which it sounds like they are(??)) then I think I've done enough within Orca to address this
T 1486489023 18<joanie18>	which means that the bug you filed is as fixed as it is going to be
T 1486489040 18<b4n18>	but as I see the very same events on both setups, I somewhat wonder it's really the environment's fault, or a different code path in Orca because of it
T 1486489045 18<b4n18>	okay yeah I get that
T 1486489064 18<b4n18>	I can probably live with a hack in Jessie in the meantime
T 1486489087 18<joanie18>	would you like to close the bug and obsolete the patches you proposed or shall I?
T 1486489135 18<b4n18>	if you don't mind I'd like to ask colleagues to test and see if there's something left I missed

T 1486508586 18<TheMuso18>	joanie: All depends on how much code has to do with legacy systray stuff.
T 1486508788 18<TheMuso18>	Anyways, need to get more familiar with the problem first.
T 1486534307 18<TheMuso18>	joanie: Is there a bug I can look at to better learn what the problems with mate panel are?
T 1486537707 18<joanie18>	TheMuso: The biggest issue seems to be related to event ordering. The menu selection happens first; then we get the window:activate events. Beyond that something(tm) mate-panel does is convincing Firefox to emit window:activate and state-changed:active and state-changed:focused events that are bogus.
T 1486537746 18<joanie18>	TheMuso: b4n claims this cannot be fixed in mate-panel and that it's a gtk+ issue.
T 1486537800 18<joanie18>	But I am hoping you can find a way to get the event ordering reversed so that the window first becomes active (or at least announces that) and then emits the selection-change event.
T 1486537826 18<joanie18>	the amount of sanity checking I am doing seems unfortunate
T 1486537852 18<joanie18>	"thank mate-panel, kids"
T 1486537937 18<joanie18>	also I think there may be some race condition or two going on
T 1486537966 18<joanie18>	because I don't always get the same events
T 1486537989 18<joanie18>	but the window activation following the menu selection seems pretty reliable
T 1486539174 18<TheMuso18>	Ok, thanks for the summary. I'll see what I can find.
T 1486539186 18<joanie18>	you rock. thanks!!
T 1486542873 18<b4n18>	TheMuso: my take is that it't not really mate-panel's fault but X focus out/in/out events upon keyboard grabs combined with a window (the panels) that don't get focused
T 1486542894 18<b4n18>	but heck, maybe I'm wrong, let's hope so :)
T 1486543083 18<TheMuso18>	Well, according to what I am seeing in accerciser, I get bounds changed signals for menus in the applications menu first, before any window activation event. If I'm understanding joanie correct, the window activate event should always be the first event from a newly focused window...
T 1486543111 18<TheMuso18>	Ad state-changed::showing events too.

T 1486543142 18<joanie18>	The state-changed:selected one is the key, however

T 1486543220 18<joanie18>	as indicated I added more sad hacks and updated existing sad hacks
T 1486543228 18<b4n18>	TheMuso: the panel's frame never gets actually activated as a window.  that's the WM choice, and it's useful not to get focus on the manel after triggering that, but having it back in the poriginal window
T 1486543234 18<joanie18>	and even did a global sanity check just for mate-panel

T 1486543263 18<joanie18>	And I'd like to be able to cross this one off my list
T 1486543269 18<joanie18>	yay for good! :)
T 1486543273 18<TheMuso18>	Yup can confirm with accerciser, Fedora 25, mate 1.16.
T 1486543303 18<joanie18>	TheMuso: if you can fix it, you will become my hero
T 1486543321 18<TheMuso18>	joanie: I'll see what I can do. No promises. :)
T 1486543332 18<joanie18>	thanks! :)
T 1486543379 18<b4n18>	joanie: no luck on 1.8/GTK2, but IIUC you don't care too much about that
T 1486543413 18<joanie18>	I'm having a really hard time caring, sorry.
T 1486543423 18<TheMuso18>	Accessibility in GTK2 is quite a different beast to GTK3.
T 1486543425 18<joanie18>	Especially given it may be something already filtered out in changes in ATK
T 1486543433 18<joanie18>	or AT-SPI2
T 1486543486 18<joanie18>	and it's Gtk+ 2 ffs ;)
T 1486543510 18<b4n18>	TheMuso: is it from an external POV?  the implementation seemed fairly similar between GAIL's *Accessible and the Gtk*Accesssible
T 1486543537 18<joanie18>	anyway b4n if it's decent enough, could you please comment on that bug and close it?
T 1486543572 18<b4n18>	joanie: yes.  I'll prepare a setup so colleagues can test today and I'll do that
T 1486543580 18<joanie18>	thanks!
T 1486543596 18<TheMuso18>	b4n: In GTK+2, accessibility is implemented in a separate module. In GTK+3, its part of the core GTK 3 library, so it is possible for any custom accessible code to directly inherrit from GTK's own accessibility objects.
T 1486543614 18<b4n18>	TheMuso: yeah I got that part :)
T 1486543634 18<b4n18>	though in GTK2 it was somewhat possible too due to the ATK registry but well
T 1486543650 18<joanie18>	there were also a bunch of fixes for a11y issues that went into gtk+3 that are not in gtk+2
T 1486543674 18<TheMuso18>	Yeah, I know, but I don't know how well that worked, and I am not sure I care really, because the way things are done in GTK+3 is cleaner.
T 1486543697 18<b4n18>	yeah, post 3.6 it's better
T 1486543700 18*	joanie would like gtk+2 to die
T 1486543718 18<b4n18>	between 3.2 and 3.6, err.  world blinked for a year
T 1486543718 18*	joanie hopes it suffers too
T 1486543785 18<TheMuso18>	joanie: From a code implementation POV a11y wise, yeah GTK 2 can die as far as I'm concerned too.
T 1486543799 18<joanie18>	:)
T 1486543964 18<TheMuso18>	Ok not sure if this was tried, but I get the same behavior when opening a menu with the mouse as well.
T 1486543984 18<TheMuso18>	So I don't think it has anything to do with the keyboard grab code, but of course that makes sense really.
T 1486560407 18<joanie18>	TheMuso and or b4n: Take a look at the mate-panel applets using accerciser.
T 1486560427 18<joanie18>	there is nothing connecting applets to the panel
T 1486560438 18<joanie18>	no parent-child relationship
T 1486560459 18<joanie18>	no alternate accessible relation type
T 1486560472 18<joanie18>	applets are their own applications and lack children
T 1486560482 18<joanie18>	like the entry of the dictionary applet
T 1486560510 18<joanie18>	those absent children emit events, mind you
T 1486560538 18<joanie18>	you just cannot locate them from the top down (i.e. in Accerciser's tree of accessibles)
T 1486560586 18<joanie18>	b4n: addressing those sorts of issues should be done in mate-panel and/or its applets and NOT through sad Orca hacks that make me cry ;)
T 1486560633 18<joanie18>	so if you have spare time to try to make mate-panel suck less, focusing on the non-Orca side of a fix or hack would be the way to go
T 1486563066 18<b4n18>	joanie: yes, applets should likely be tied with the panel through AtkSocket/AtkPlug
T 1486563091 18<b4n18>	or mate-panel should stop having those as separate apps as their current sutff only works under X anyway
T 1486563185 18*	joanie nods
T 1486563223 18<joanie18>	if you work on a solution that doesn't JustWork(tm) with Orca, lemme know.
T 1486563291 18<b4n18>	okay
T 1486563337 18<b4n18>	not sure I'll have time for that one "soon" as it seems not trivial, but I'll keep it in mind if no one else beats me to it (:wink: to anyone interested)
T 1486585502 18<TheMuso18>	b4n: Yeah, as much as having them as separate executables may bring some protectino to the panel, maybe it needs to be a plugin interface using libpeas, which can still allow people to write applets in python/any GObject introspection compatible language.
T 1486585516 18<TheMuso18>	Which should work going forward in the wayland world.
T 1486629441 18<b4n18>	TheMuso: IIUC that's already working, and they support in-process applets too, just that they prefer the external ones.  but yeah they probably need changing something if they don't wanna get stuck to X forever

T 1487169518 18<b4n18>	but in the end yeah, better :)
T 1487169722 18<b4n18>	joanie: BTW, Orca uses the Text interface and not the accessible-name... I guess it's expected? but that's not really appropriate for my case because the text is merely what's displayed, and it's abbreviated.  anyway, we can deal wit hthis later, no biggie, just mentioning
T 1487169777 18<joanie18>	it sometimes uses the name and sometimes the text depending on the situation. hack arounds due to miscellaneous crap.

T 1487193328 18<joanie18>	b4n: Should be fixed in Orca master now.
T 1487193353 18<joanie18>	related aside: Now that Orca is presenting the week numbers, I wonder if the row headers should include some indication of being a week
T 1487193378 18<joanie18>	otherwise you get the week number (just the int) followed by "row header" followed by the selected day in the calendar
