T 1533060922 18<nb18>	the part about not listening on network sockets..... when certbot-renew timer runs, if it needs to renew a cert that was obtained with --standalone, it will temporarily listen during the verification process then will stop again

T 1533060945 18<nb18>	if --webroot or dns or something else was used, i think it would meet the criteria on the guidelines
T 1533060956 18<tibbs18>	Don't you have to configure it or something?
T 1533060985 18<nb18>	tibbs, certbot-renew will work just fine even if there are not certs configured
T 1533061000 18<nb18>	it just tries to renew any certs that are more than 2/3 through their validity period
T 1533061015 18<Elyscape18>	yeah, by default, it doesn't do anything. if you've configured any certs, it'll perform whatever actions are necessary to renew them, which may include listening on a network socket
T 1533061062 18<tibbs18>	I mean, I wouldn't turn it on just because you have the package installed.
T 1533061097 18<tibbs18>	But I don't really know what to tell you.  I don't know how listening on a network socket could even work in general.  What if you're behind NAT or something?
T 1533061118 18<Elyscape18>	if you're using that validation method, you'll have already configured that stuff
T 1533061153 18<Elyscape18>	there are several validation methods and the only one that requires listening on a network socket is not recommended for most deployments
T 1533061167 18<nb18>	tibbs, we are asking if the guidelines would allow us to turn certbot-renew on by default
T 1533061187 18<Elyscape18>	but also it remembers the validation method you used for a given cert, so it'll only listen on a network socket if you told it to before, in which case you'd have already figured out NAT port forwarding or whatever
T 1533061202 18<nb18>	from reading the criteria on the services page it looks like it would be ok, as long as the user didn't use --standalone which makes it listen on a socket during validation
T 1533061212 18<tibbs18>	So if you have to configure before it is useful, then I guess I don't understand the question.  Running systemctl enable would be part of that configuration.
T 1533061272 18<Elyscape18>	it still starts properly, it just doesn't do anything until you've configured it. the thing is, configuring it is generally done by running a command, rather than editing config files
T 1533061353 18<Elyscape18>	my reasoning for turning on the timer by default is this: generally, if you're installing certbot, you want it to manage your certs, which includes renewing them. having the timer enabled by default simplifies that
T 1533061369 18<tibbs18>	You have no idea why anyone installed the package.
T 1533061375 18<tibbs18>	Maybe they wanted to look at the documentation?
T 1533061435 18<Elyscape18>	well the good news there is that we aren't currently building the documentation, and when we fix that it'll be in a separate package
T 1533061469 18<d9k18>	please do not turn anything by default if it is not completely necessary
T 1533061506 18<tibbs18>	d9k: Well, that view doesn't agree with what Fedora currently wants.

T 1533061580 18<tibbs18>	So, if I understand everything correctly and you really don't violate the four MUSTs listed on https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:DefaultServices then I think you wouldn't be in violation.
T 1533061585 18<Elyscape18>	the certbot package itself (as compared to the python-certbot packages) only provides the binary commands and the systemd units
T 1533061603 18<nb18>	personally i don't know that i would expect for it to renew stuff atuomatically, but i don't think it would be bad if it does do so
T 1533061632 18<tibbs18>	I still wouldn't turn it on personally since setup is required before it's actually useful, and a quick 'systemctl enable' should just be part of that setup.
T 1533061670 18<tibbs18>	But it seems like the worst thing that would happen is maybe some log pollution by this thing running forever and not doing anything.
T 1533061704 18<tibbs18>	But if it spams the logs about not being configured or anything like that, then it certainly shouldn't be enabled.
T 1533061829 18<Elyscape18>	without configuration, it logs a line saying "No renewals were attempted." once per run, which is scheduled to happen daily
T 1533062314 18*	gholms adds ``systemctl disable certbot-renew.service certbot-renew.timer'' to his kickstart templates just in case
T 1533062361 18<grift18>	i think the `systemctl` is the easier part of the config, theres probably other low hanging fruit, although i have to say that certbot is pretty good state. but the assumption is that someone wants to renew automatically, and that it wants to try daily
T 1533062400 18<grift18>	i suppose daily tries makes sense if you have a shedload of certs

T 1533062432 18<gholms18>	Ooh, actually, can kickstart service directives refer to systemd units other than .service ones?
T 1533062956 18<grift18>	in other words the units are optional
T 1533064060 18<Elyscape18>	grift: it doesn't actually try to renew daily. it runs `certbot renew` daily, which only actually attempts to renew a cert if the cert has only 1/3 of its life left
T 1533064149 18<grift18>	yes ok, point i am trying to make is that its optional, one might be fine with running certbot manually

T 1533064223 18<Elyscape18>	FWIW, the reason upstream made the decision to recommend running daily in a timer unit or cron job is that certbot is designed to be a set-and-forget thing, and running daily lets that happen and also means that, if the renew process fails one day due to network conditions or something, it'll try again the next day
T 1533064233 18<Elyscape18>	but that's sorta neither here nor there

T 1539802385 18<sergiodj18>	hi there.  just trying to understand better the CI Gating thing.  IIUC, only a very specific set of tests can be enabled via the gating mechanism, right?
T 1539802414 18<sergiodj18>	i.e., it's not possible to, e.g., run you project's own testsuite and enable gating based on its results
T 1539802418 18<sergiodj18>	or is it?
T 1539802488 18<sergiodj18>	a bit of background: I'm asking because I'm working on enabling gating for GDB
T 1539803315 18<misc18>	usually, people do that with %check already, no ?
T 1539803552 18<mizdebsk18>	sergiodj, it should be possible to run arbitrary tests from dist-git

T 1539803740 18<sergiodj18>	misc: yeah...  we already use %check for some regular testing, but I was wondering if the "trend" now is to use CI/gating

T 1539803927 18<mizdebsk18>	sergiodj, gating is not yet enabled in fedora, so right now you can't

T 1539982445 18<mizdebsk18>	true; you update generated block only when there is a problem
T 1539982469 18<nim18>	mizdebsk, so you kepp old deps which are no longer necessary
T 1539982500 18<nim18>	mizdebsk, and the end result for an langage ecosystem that rewrites its deps every other month like golang is awful

T 1539982708 18<nim18>	mizdebsk, the Go maintainers have spent years trying to audit the state of the Go packages through out of band scipts they never managed to do it
T 1539982741 18<nim18>	mizdebsk, the end result was just a pile of rotting generated spec files no one undertood or maintained
T 1539982777 18<nim18>	mizdebsk, the mecanism I've prototyped for go is pretty transparent
T 1539982791 18<mizdebsk18>	i agree that auto-buildrequires would be good to have, but i don't believe fedora will enable them any time soon
T 1539982808 18<nim18>	mizdebsk, you see exactly in the build logs what was reuested from pm_request and when i nthe spec
T 1539982838 18<nim18>	mizdebsk, if they want unbundled go software they will have to do it
T 1539982911 18<nim18>	mizdebsk, if they prefer shipping bundled stuff no one has any idea where it comes from and what CVEs it includes like it is done right now

T 1539983054 18<nim18>	mizdebsk, we've past the point were anyone can pretend not doing pm request is constructive, we have the years of experience not doing it and the result it produced for fedora packages
T 1539983235 18<nim18>	mizdebsk, also in case you didn't know, go does not use dynamic libraries
T 1539983288 18<nim18>	mizdebsk, the end-result software needs to dep directly on every bit of code involved in its build
T 1539983339 18<nim18>	mizdebsk, for complex software like docker or kubernetes that's score if not hundreds of deps to record in the spec file

T 1542987272 18<timothy18>	hi, is there any reason to have java-1.8.0-openjdk as dependency of ant since ant can work with any java version?
T 1542987472 18<tomhughes18>	is not a require, it's a recommend (on java-devel >= 1:1.8.0)
T 1542987498 18<tomhughes18>	so while that might be the default way of satisfying it other versions should do so if installed
T 1542987519 18<timothy18>	tomhughes: no, ant requires javapackages-tools that hard-requires java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless

T 1542987530 18<timothy18>	but without a good reason imho
T 1542987532 18<tomhughes18>	so it's not ant that's the problem then
T 1542987538 18<tomhughes18>	it's javapackages-tools that is the problem
T 1542990874 18<mizdebsk18>	timothy, the reason is that ant is tested only with jdk 8
T 1542990896 18<mizdebsk18>	i don't have time to test it with all jdk, available in fedora and third-party

T 1542991045 18<mizdebsk18>	users can change which jdk is used to run ant, but at their own risk
T 1542991432 18<timothy18>	mizdebsk: thank you (btw oracle will deprecated java8 in a year, so I think we should move to java11 or 12 in the next fedora releases)
T 1542991462 18<mizdebsk18>	timothy, i am planning to move to java 11 indeed
T 1542991471 18<mizdebsk18>	as it's next lts release after 8
T 1542991482 18<timothy18>	sure
T 1543004548 18<redi18>	the f29 installation guide recommends 10gb for /
T 1543004625 18<redi18>	my / is over 15gb, and that's with a separate partition for /var
T 1543004665 18<redi18>	10gb seems outdated

T 1543006542 18<linuxplease18>	and if you choose automatic partitioning it wont do that
T 1543006594 18<linuxplease18>	my point was dont separate /var and /
T 1543008630 18<thm18>	it's really easy to have ~16G in /
T 1543008841 18<thm18>	btw, it seems dnf and PackageKit still have duplicate caches. this was discussed long time ago, but still is unsolved
T 1543011508 18<QuLogic18>	if you have been upgrading from previous release, make sure to check package caches for old releases
T 1543011520 18<QuLogic18>	I've cleaned several gigs from deleting those
T 1543011562 18<DrNick18>	/ should probably be 40GB
