T 1501515879 18<RangerRick18>	If I hit "install" it launches as neon again.  If I hit "skip", it asks again on next startup.  What's the correct way to clean this up?

T 1501516013 18<RangerRick18>	I have no recollection. But I imagine I did.  I used whatever installer the eclipse download page pointed me at.
T 1501516049 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, ok so instead of "check update" use the entry menu "Perform setup task"
T 1501516054 18<RangerRick18>	(I realize there are many, but it was quite some time ago, I can't recall my specific steps from over a year ago.)

T 1501516284 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, launch it "Finish" and you'll can open the detail window (the status icon turning on the bottom of the screen)
T 1501516367 18<RangerRick18>	looks like it installed some mac-specific tooling packages

T 1501516625 18<RangerRick18>	it's in /Applications/eclipse
T 1501516639 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, so you're update but I'm not sure why it do not propose you to upgrade to oxygen
T 1501516685 18<RangerRick18>	if I go to "check for updates" it gives me all the individual oxygen updates again, but I suspect I'll be back in the same place
T 1501516741 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, yes because of oomph which manage now the pool of plugins
T 1501516771 18<RangerRick18>	I guess I can just do a clean install, but I've never quite grokked how to get all my plugins/config back to the way they are when doing so.
T 1501516843 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, that's something than oomph can do for you ... but first you have to configure the plugins/settins you want to keep between versions

T 1501517203 18<RangerRick18>	oh, so "update" update my eclipse, not just the installer?
T 1501517227 18<RangerRick18>	or was I supposed to run "eclipseinst" from my existing eclipse install somehow?
T 1501517312 18<RangerRick18>	same choice in eclipse, P2 Director (Neon)

T 1501517444 18<mvvvv18>	eclipseinst is only when you want to install one or many eclipse product and share the plugins
T 1501517495 18<RangerRick18>	correct, no change
T 1501517513 18<RangerRick18>	I just didn't know how eclipseinst affects an already running eclipse, since I'm just running it out of my downloads directory
T 1501517518 18<RangerRick18>	but I see it updates something in ~/.p2
T 1501517559 18<mvvvv18>	yes .p2 is where the plugins are with oomph (or EclipseInst) You should have something like that : https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1082235/
T 1501517959 18<RangerRick18>	so yeah, that thread sounds like my same issue, so it sounds like that is saying I should just run eclipse installer over my existing installation?
T 1501517989 18<RangerRick18>	because I still seem to be stuck in the same place
T 1501518025 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, yes something is missing, maybe the way you installed it first ...
T 1501518217 18<RangerRick18>	did that, now setup tasks gives me the oxygen version of P2 Director, so there's that at least
T 1501518232 18<RangerRick18>	didn't get the popup either
T 1501518289 18<RangerRick18>	Everything at least appears to be still working, and I didn't get that reminder on startup.  Thanks for the help.

T 1501518603 18<RangerRick18>	I guess that wiki page needs updating then  :)

T 1506700782 18<g1118>	Hello. I'm trying to install an older plugin ("Bytecode Visualizer") which was made for the 4.5 version of Eclipse, which I am using.
T 1506700786 18<g1118>	When I try to install it from the Eclipse Marketplace I get an error: "Unable to read repository at http://sourceforge.net/projects/drgarbagetools/files/eclipse/4.5/stable/content.xml. Received fatal alert: handshake_failure"
T 1506700934 18<g1118>	The link in the error points to a 'content.xml' which does not exist. Instead there is a 'content.jar'.
T 1506713164 18<zarzar18>	anyone know what this error is caused by: ignoring nonexistent directory "/usr/local/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf"
