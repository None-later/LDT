T 1509897100 18<Matt181218>	Hello all - I'm new to Eclipse but have been doing development for a while, and just trying to play with the IDE.  Using CDT for C++ programming, and a few things about the GUI are just driving me crazy, that I'm hoping there's an easy answer to that I'm just not finding via Google.  Both of these are using the Dark theme, which I really like and was one of the main draws, Eclipse 4.7.1a, Linux Debian Jessie (8)
T 1509897100 18<Matt181218>	 is the development VM (I cannot upgrade that), running openjdk-8-jre from jessie-backports (Version 8u131).  First off, the menu bar is black text on a very dark gray background - nearly impossible to read.  The second issue is something similar in the build console window - normal messages from the compiler are also black text on a dark gray background.  I fix both, kind of, with doing "export SWT_GTK3=0" as
T 1509897100 18<Matt181218>	 suggested by https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=436753, but the moment I click into the build window to do anything, the background goes from white to black again.
T 1509897355 18<Matt181218>	The other problem with the SWT_GTK3=0 trick is it makes checkboxes and some other GUI elements white-on-white, and impossible to see the state of :(
T 1509897458 18<Matt181218>	So I guess, in short, what I need to know is: a) Without using SWT_GTK3, how do I get the menu bar's background color corrected, and b) How do I change the default text foreground color in the Console tab from black to white?
T 1509897885 18<mvvvv18>	Matt1812, what is the OS and DE you're using ?
T 1509897933 18<mvvvv18>	ok Debian

T 1509898179 18<mvvvv18>	pretty old one ...  the problems about SWT_GTK3=1 are about gnome versions but I do not know which version is better
T 1509898328 18<Matt181218>	My other option is to run Eclipse on a different, up-to-date machine, but I would need to use the compiler, linker, includes, etc. on the remote machine.  A Google search seemed to indicate I could do this with a "Remote C++" project and an RDT server, but that was looking rather messy to set up
T 1509898365 18<Matt181218>	And it wasn't clear if things like the Indexer would actually work like I want like that
T 1509901775 18<Matt181218>	I think I found the answer to the second under Preferences > C/C++ > Build > Console (I was rooting through the various Appearance trees eariler...)
T 1509902134 18<Matt181218>	Okay, so next question - the fonts are really really small for the high res screen I'm using.  This is another thing where the various Google responses don't seem to work.  How do I increase the size of everything (editor text, GUI elements, the list items in the various views, etc.)?

T 1510005797 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind: That is, the "wtpwebapps" directory doesn't have a directory with that project's name.
T 1510005841 18<nitind18>	davidmichaelkarr: Did you set the options to serve modules without publishing (is that the phrasing it uses?)?
T 1510005931 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind: It's called "Serve modules without publishing", and I don't have it on.  I'm pretty certain this is another case of the data restore left some things corrupted.  For instance, I believe it would have removed all jar files.
T 1510005965 18<nitind18>	This is fast exceeding the level at which I understand the underpinnings.
T 1510006232 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind: Got it.  I have no idea why, but somehow something inserted a "Context" element in my server's server.xml file, that references this app.  This was not in the older instance, so I removed it, and now it works.
T 1510006463 18<nitind18>	Ah, yes that determines where it gets deployed to on Tomcat.
T 1510006466 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind: Ok, well, not fixed.  I figured out what is adding that line, and it's eclipse, trying to start the server.
T 1510006513 18<nitind18>	The project might have a Property page that controls that, or it's in the Server's properties directly.
T 1510007592 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind: Of the two apps I'm trying to run here, one gets a directory created in that "wtpwebapps" directory, but the other does not (the GUI one, obviously).
T 1510008180 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind: Sigh.  Got that working.  For some reason I had to do a "Refresh Gradle Project" on the GUI project.  No idea why.
T 1510008289 18<nitind18>	If you're using Gradle or Maven, their files are the one true source for how to configure the project. Maybe installing the missing Eclipse plug-ins didn't automatically trigger that kind of update.

T 1510020403 18<shalok18>	Eclipse doesn't provide any indication why it's skipping it and 'debug as' never breaks at any point.

T 1510027247 18<shalok18>	I eventually discovered some .java files that extend junit and are used to configure which tests to run. When I commented these out my tests got run.
T 1510027369 18<shalok18>	I was annoyed at the lack of feedback from eclipse about what was going on so I'm using intellij atm. It is a little less opaque and gives more meaningful log messages.
T 1510028148 18<MarkB218>	I've been working on a small project... and start getting a load of errors out of Eclipse CDT.  Exiting and restarting Eclipse Oxygen.1a cleaned out that problem... but now it can't find Debug/makefile .

T 1510047101 18<markus-k18>	Any idea why eclipse could ignore symbols defined in my C-project settings in autocomplete?
T 1510047131 18<markus-k18>	This is one of the headers in question: https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3/blob/master/include/libopencm3/stm32/rcc.h . I have STM32F3 defined in the project settings, but it includes all headers
T 1510065877 18<el_cubano18>	Hi.  I am curious about how to stop Eclipse from automatically rewriting the Javadoc URL for the JDK whenever the latter is upgraded.
T 1510065902 18<el_cubano18>	In my case, I have the documentation installed locally, so I have a file:/// URL pointing to the local documentation.
T 1510065948 18<el_cubano18>	However, everytime that the JDK is updated, Eclipse rewrites the URL to a http://www.orcale.com/... URL.  This is rather annoying as it results in the Javadoc silently disappearing when I work offline.  Then I have to manually reset the URL.
T 1510066151 18<el_cubano18>	I have seen the URLs specified in .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.launching.prefs, but I cannot figure out how to get Eclipse to not change the URLs.  Am I missing some configuration option somewhere?
