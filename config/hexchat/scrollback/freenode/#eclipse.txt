T 1498550659 18<Stummi18>	is there a way to fix this from eclipses side?
T 1498550661 18<Stummi18>	https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/1368
T 1498550734 18<Stummi18>	I am using lomboks @NonNull annotation for null analysis, since I want both, checking nullity at compile time (through the ECJ) and null-checking in runtime. However, eclipse raises a Dead Code warning when I null check a @NonNull annotated field (which the lombok generated code does)
T 1498559832 18<surial18>	Stummi: I guess we could fix that from the lombok side by wrapping it in Lombok.preventNullAnalysis....
T 1498560445 18<Stummi18>	surial, thought about that as well, but it would change the AST based nullity, which could confuse other tools then
T 1498560464 18<surial18>	shit. Good point.
T 1498560475 18<surial18>	actually....
T 1498560486 18<surial18>	lombok removes it from the class file so from the class file perspective it looks just like if (x == null) throw.
T 1498560502 18<surial18>	how many tools operate on the intermediate AST that exists only in the process memory of eclipse?

T 1498666686 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Question about something I saw in the Oxygen release info, concerning the Ctrl+e quick list feature: "This works now also if you have selected a view in the editor area. " Does anyone known what that means?
T 1498666754 18<nitind18>	davidmichaelkarr: You can drop Views into the Editor stack, so their names also show up in the "editor list".
T 1498666866 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind: Still don't understand.  By "Views", do you mean something besides what shows up in the editor view?
T 1498666995 18<nitind18>	davidmichaelkarr: Yes, the kind things that are in the Show View menu of the Window menu. http://help.eclipse.org/oxygen/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/concepts-5.htm?cp=0_2_4
T 1498667109 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind: Interesting. This means I can switch to any view now just from the keyboard.

T 1498668238 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind: That's true, just haven't gotten used to using that.  Quick Editor Switch I use constantly.
T 1498668257 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Continuing with the release notes, I don't understand "Triggers for breakpoints".  It's not clear what a "trigger" is or does.
T 1498668399 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Oh my.  I've been wanting "Toggle Tracepoint" for a long time.
T 1498668573 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Does Oxygen now require Java 8?  The point about SWT requiring Java 8 seems to imply that.

T 1498670197 18<nitind18>	davidmichaelkarr: Yes, you have to add the corresponding Oxygen urls for the ones you already have for Neon to the list of Available Sites.
T 1498671067 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind: So do you know about "Triggers for breakpoints"?  I don't understand what that does.
T 1498671132 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Curious that my first run of the Oxygen installer (not from update site) died with a NPE in SWT.  Fortunately, the second try appears to be fine.

T 1498676260 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind: I meant when I click on the "Anonymous cannot submit tasks" thing, because it renders in red and is clickable, it brings up the preferences for authenticating to eclipse.org.

You *must* use a 32-bit JRE with a 32-bit Eclipse download, and a 64-bit JRE with a 64-bit Eclipse. As a simple test, open a Command Prompt window and run the intended java.exe with the -d32 switch to test if it supports 32-bit, or -d64 to test for 64-bit support.

T 1499713340 18<webczat18>	how to do automated deployment of plugins and features?
T 1499713354 18<webczat18>	I mean creating my own plugins to then deploy them somewhere
T 1499713759 18<nitind18>	You can use the director application or other means. https://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Director_application
T 1499714485 18<webczat18>	well I actually mean how to make a plugin and then release it to an update site/etc
T 1499714506 18<webczat18>	especially if I want it to be build by a ci system
T 1499716597 18<transhuman18>	hi I installed eclipse with PyDev my program I am building uses pandas so I went and did a pip install pandas into the main python but eclipse doesn't see it...how do i fix ...thanks in advance
T 1499718403 18<webczat18>	transhuman: not sure if you will receive an answer here as py-dev is not a plugin released with eclipse... but maybe
T 1499718503 18<transhuman18>	I think its a general question for eclipse .."how do i install a python module?"
T 1499718559 18<webczat18>	py-dev is a 3'rd party plugin afaik
T 1499718681 18<transhuman18>	is there a channel you know of anywhere for py-dev ?
T 1499718730 18<webczat18>	unfortunately not, but pydev homepage may have links to irc channels or mailing lists
T 1499718751 18<transhuman18>	ok thanks
T 1499720732 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	I'm having trouble installing subversive in oxygen.  The main plugin installs fine, but when I try to select connectors, the dialog just goes away without doing anything.  There's nothing of significance in the log.
T 1499720763 18<webczat18>	well if that happens maybe try installing with eclipse marketplace client?
T 1499720776 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	I tried, but I can't find the connectors there.
T 1499720812 18<webczat18>	hmm not sure then
T 1499720819 18<webczat18>	I do not use subversive in oxygen :)
T 1499720861 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Ah, looks like several people have hit this. It's noted in the forum.  Looking at the workaround.
T 1499720893 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	I'd prefer not to use SVN either, but I still have to collaborate with groups using legacy systems.
T 1499721316 18<webczat18>	fortunately I do not have to work with that so I did not install subversive this time
T 1499763902 18<chibby0ne18>	Does anyone know how to set the jre for Eclipse, by creating a jre directory inside the Eclipse directory on MacOSX? For Windows/Linux you can just create a directory named jre inside the eclipse directory and next to features, plugins, configuration, etc.. and copy the contents of the jre into it and Eclipse would use this jre for launching. Does anyone know how to achieve the same thing in MacOS?
T 1499777252 18<webczat18>	hey, if I use things like baseURL etc to download eclipse during automated plugin/feature building (I meant settings in build.properties) do I still need another base eclipse to actually invoke the build script?
T 1499779116 18<daemon87_18>	hello, I have a question related to the Display class usage, anyone that can help me with this?
T 1499779155 18<daemon87_18>	The jboss tools call a Display.getDefault().asyncExec(new Runnable() { during the start of the bundle, which means that the Display class gets registered with the loading thread of osgi
T 1499779211 18<daemon87_18>	and this causes failure with the rest of the eclipse framework of course ... Is there a place where i can put the init of this class (should be somewhere in a main thread)
T 1499779216 18<daemon87_18>	any pointers? :-)
T 1499779259 18<daemon87_18>	would be great if someone could unblock me, except uninstalling the jboss tools, since that would be annoying :-)

T 1499784417 18<nitind18>	daemon87_: What's it doing that's so heavy that it needs passing it off to an async?

T 1499784634 18<daemon87_18>	it tries to load in a class and it has always been like that it seems
T 1499784665 18<daemon87_18>	that function is called in the 'Start Level: Equinox Container: 710f71bc-337e-4a04-b147-a0153c33' -thread, while the other functions are loaded in the main thread
T 1499784697 18<daemon87_18>	resulting in the famous - but PITA- message org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Invalid thread access
T 1499784734 18<daemon87_18>	I mean executed instead of loaded
T 1499784735 18<eclipse-mm18>	<nitind> Why not just not do that there? It's a singleton, ripe for lazy initialization.
T 1499784813 18<daemon87_18>	I was thinking of adding a simple Display.asyncExec with a message in org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter
T 1499784846 18<daemon87_18>	but that wouldn't really be nice :-) Since that class is executed in the main thread ...
T 1499784960 18<daemon87_18>	but it would get rid of all plugins that are using the Display in the start of the bundle, since that could always cause issues with the wrong thread being used I guess
T 1499785042 18<daemon87_18>	<eclipse-mm> if you do this in the start of the bundle it would cause the dreaded 'org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Invalid thread access' since the Display wasn't initialised yet in the main thread
T 1499785053 18<daemon87_18>	i don't know if that makes sense what i'm saying :-)
T 1499785115 18<daemon87_18>	since you have two threads: one because of the lazy initiliaser in 'Start Level: Equinox Container:'-thread and one in the main-thread
T 1499785299 18<daemon87_18>	any idea?
T 1499785490 18<nitind18>	Yes, just don't do that during plug-in start. It's a singleton that will initialize itself the first time it's actually used.
T 1499785534 18<daemon87_18>	I'm not the developer of that plugin, only a simple user of the jboss tools :-)
T 1499785573 18<daemon87_18>	I know it's bad, or i'll create a pull-request and submit a patch for it
T 1499785951 18<daemon87_18>	thanks for the confirmation :-)
T 1499786968 18<nitind18>	thanks for diagnosing it
T 1499787257 18<daemon87_18>	<nitind>: you are welcome, was an interesting experience :-)
T 1499787426 18<daemon87_18>	I'm especially looking forward to experimenting with the DI in the new eclipse framework
T 1499787426 18<daemon87_18>	it looks like fun
