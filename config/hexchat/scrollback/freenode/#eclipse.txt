T 1523488039 18<nohop18>	"Errors exist in the active configuration"... "Proceed with launch?"
T 1523488048 18<nohop18>	And then the only option is "Always launch without asking"

T 1523488064 18<nohop18>	First of all, I wonder why anyone would ever do that?
T 1523488080 18<nitind18>	Maybe you don't care about the parts that are broken.
T 1523488080 18<nohop18>	I want it to NEVER launch when errors.
T 1523488125 18<nohop18>	I don't want it to ask me, either :) If I fuck up, I want it not to run. Where do I tell eclipse that? (I know you can, I just can't find it...)
T 1523488193 18<nitind18>	https://help.eclipse.org/oxygen/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/preferences/run-debug/ref-launching.htm?cp=1_4_2_1_1 , maybe check the Problems View before you tell it to Launch? Wanting it not to do what you've clearly told it to do is...odd.
T 1523488260 18<nohop18>	Really? Eclipse is the only environment that does this that I've ever worked with :)
T 1523488285 18<nohop18>	Most IDE's do "Hey, you're code's fucked. Can't run your code: not running your code"
T 1523488311 18<nohop18>	"Can't run your code: still runniyour co code" is much more odd, if you ask me.
T 1523488328 18<nohop18>	Without the typos that would've come across even better :)
T 1523488335 18<nitind18>	It's more productive to run the parts you care about.
T 1523488357 18<nohop18>	Hmm.. I disagree. Matter of opinion, I guess.
T 1523488367 18<mbooth18>	nohop: What do you mean by "And then the only option is "Always launch without asking"" ?
T 1523488375 18<mbooth18>	It's a checkbox, no?
T 1523488432 18<nohop18>	mbooth: Oh, yeah. I mean "Always NOT launch without asking" is missing (with better wording, that it)
T 1523488439 18<nohop18>	s/it/is/
T 1523488483 18<nitind18>	ok, but it's not exactly deciding to launch on its own...
T 1523488492 18<mbooth18>	nohop: What behaviour would you prefer? Silently not do anything when you hit the run button?
T 1523488585 18<mbooth18>	It's already "always NOT launching" because you are seeing that dialog ;-)
T 1523488605 18<nohop18>	nitind: Sure, but it interferes a lot with my workflow. I am so used to notice compiler error, and clicking in the editor to fix it. Without this dialog being in the way :)
T 1523488679 18<nohop18>	Yeah. I'm not used to the dialog :) When I use VIM and a bash shell, I just see a compiler error in the shell. When I use QT Creator, I just see a compiler error in the compiler output. When I use Visual studio I just see a compiler error in the console or whatever it's called.
T 1523488716 18<nohop18>	When I use eclipse, I get an annoying dialog in my face that requires an unnecessary step before I can go on and fix my broken code :)
T 1523488747 18<mbooth18>	nohop: What? You can see compiler errors in Eclipse without attempting to run your program --- as nitind said, watch the problem view
T 1523488767 18<nitind18>	Did you not just let it autobuild?
T 1523488793 18<nohop18>	mbooth: That's my point. I SEE the compiler error. I don't want the dialog. I already know the compiler failed. I don't need the dialog to ALSO tell me that it failed.
T 1523488807 18<mbooth18>	nohop: Why are you running your program before fixing compilation errors?
T 1523488827 18<nitind18>	If you saw the compiler error, why'd you tell it to launch?
T 1523488836 18<mbooth18>	nohop: There is something I'm missing about your workflow, clearly...
T 1523488853 18<nohop18>	mbooth: Because I do the same thing in every IDE. I click "RUN" to auto-compile, and run. Then fix if I need to fix it :)
T 1523488866 18<nohop18>	99.999% of the time, when I compile my shit, I want to run it.
T 1523488886 18<mbooth18>	nohop: But it auto-compiles without having to click run...
T 1523488901 18<nitind18>	Woooooah, if you let it build automatically, you don't have wait that long to know when things are broken.
T 1523488912 18<nohop18>	I am completely and utterly confused by the reactions here :)
T 1523488932 18<mbooth18>	nohop: You are performing a needless extra step
T 1523488934 18<nohop18>	Eclipse does this different than any other IDE in the world. Is there a way to make it do the same thing as every other IDE in the world?
T 1523488935 18<nohop18>	:)
T 1523488942 18<nitind18>	Turn on Project->Build Automatically, and then pay attention to the Problems/Markers Views.
T 1523488956 18<nohop18>	mbooth: No. With my normal work flow, eclipse is forcing me to perform an extra step.
T 1523488961 18<nohop18>	Haha.
T 1523488977 18<nohop18>	Never mind :) I'll just deal with it and try to keep in mind that eclipse need extra care :)
T 1523489020 18<nitind18>	You don't have to click Run for it to start finding problems. It can do that before you even move the mouse there.
T 1523489074 18<nohop18>	Sure. It's very handy though. I change some code, want to test it, so I press "run" (or press ctrl-F11, in my case)
T 1523489092 18<nohop18>	Then, if it doesn't compile, go fix my code and press run again.
T 1523489098 18<nitind18>	Ok, but at least for compiler breakages, it can do those checks for you in the background.
T 1523489100 18<nohop18>	iterate until success!
T 1523489113 18<nitind18>	Automatically when you change things.
T 1523489115 18<nitind18>	Faster.
T 1523489143 18<nohop18>	Not ssure what you mean. "Build automatically" IS enabled.
T 1523489156 18<mbooth18>	nohop: Then you don't need to run the program to see compilation problems...
T 1523489180 18<mbooth18>	Clicking run or pressing ctrl+F11 is pointless extra effort in this case
T 1523489190 18<nitind18>	Then it's throwing a dialog up showing you information it already knew about and was able to show you before.
T 1523489200 18<nitind18>	In the Problems View.
T 1523489543 18<nohop18>	Just for clearity, I'm using it for a C++ project. The "Problems" window doesn't find any problems unless I manually run/build the project.
T 1523489555 18<nohop18>	I don't think "build automatically" changes anything in that respect.
T 1523489576 18<nohop18>	Maybe a bug, but this has been the case ever since I've used eclipse.
T 1523489588 18<nohop18>	ever since the first time, that is.
T 1523489618 18<nohop18>	But whatever, never mind. It's not a big deal either. I just wondered if I could change this behavior :)
T 1523489620 18<mbooth18>	nohop: Oh, for C/C++ projects, why aren't you hitting "build" instead of "run" ?
T 1523489670 18<nohop18>	Because hitting build, and then run (if I want to run it) is 2 steps wheras hitting only 'run' is only one.
T 1523489690 18<nohop18>	Which would've stayed at a convenient one if that dialog didn't increment it up to two :)
T 1523489748 18<nitind18>	Building automatically should do exactly what it sounds like, rebuilding when you change a source file and then updating the contents of the Problems View, but automatically rather than requiring you to tell it to Build.
T 1523489815 18<nohop18>	Ah, I see. Well, it doesn't do that :)
T 1523489880 18<nohop18>	I've never seen it do that either, but I've only used eclipse for C/C++.. maybe that's why.
T 1523489927 18<mbooth18>	nohop: What kind of c/c++ project? On my makefile projects, I have to enable it in project settings
T 1523490005 18<mbooth18>	nohop: Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Behaviour tab -> Build on resource save
T 1523490044 18<mbooth18>	nohop: Unless people say otherwise we assume people are Java programmers ;-)
T 1523490055 18<nohop18>	I don't remember what it's called. It has been a long time before this project that I've used it. Not a makefile, eclipse 'does the making for me'
T 1523490070 18<nohop18>	mbooth: Yeah, I should've probably mentioned the C/C++ thing earlier :)
T 1523490122 18<nohop18>	mbooth: I have a "build automatically" Directly in the "project" menu
T 1523490147 18<mbooth18>	nohop: Yes, and as I said, I have to enable a separate setting for my C projects
T 1523490163 18<mbooth18>	nohop: I suggest you also investigate the settings for your project ;-)
T 1523490223 18<nohop18>	Yeah. I found that setting. That's not really any help. If I have to hit save, I may as well hit build :)
T 1523490285 18<nohop18>	Oh well. Thanks for the help anyways :) Other than this little 'quirk', I do really like eclipse.
T 1523490293 18<mbooth18>	Sigh. You should be hitting save any way. This way you can hit save until all your compilation errors are gone. I don't really know why this is difficult to get....
T 1523490318 18<mbooth18>	Unless you really like reading information you already knew ;-)
T 1523490342 18<nohop18>	mbooth: It's not difficult to get. It's just different that anything else I ever use, so it's not intuitive to me, that's all.
T 1523490412 18<mbooth18>	nohop: Okay. Well, you can either learn to use your tools or not I suppose. Wilful ignorance isn't an attractive quality.
T 1523490496 18<nohop18>	Wilful ignorance? Just asking if a tool's behavior can be changed in some way you're used to isn't that bad, i think?
T 1523490711 18<mbooth18>	You just seemed pretty keen on ignoring the advice to use it instead of hitting run all the time -- was beginning to wonder if I was being trolled ;-)
T 1523490765 18<mbooth18>	Auto-building code is not an unusual feature, IDEA also has it
T 1523490813 18<nohop18>	Sure. And I wasn't ignoring the advice. I also know how to build before running. It's just that that wasn't my question.

T 1523561205 18<xbb18>	I don't want to install maven on user's machine or ask to install one. I do package m2e however, so can I use m2e to supply maven directory if it uses it under covers?
T 1523561996 18<rgrunber18>	xbb: m2e may use it but its notion of ${maven.home} could be quite different than a physical filesystem location..
T 1523562024 18<rgrunber18>	xbb: for eg. if i run a maven build on oxygen with m2e i see : Maven home: /tmp/foo/workspace/org.foo.bar/EMBEDDED

T 1523562273 18<rgrunber18>	although.. it seems the runtime itself should be in eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.m2e.maven.runtime_*/jars/ so maybe if you created a some directory above and called it lib and if enough was in the other directories (bin, boot, conf) it might work ?

T 1524679227 18<rgrunber18>	xbb_: the bug itself was fixed in equinox.. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=489686 ( http://git.eclipse.org/c/equinox/rt.equinox.framework.git/commit/?id=1b7bd98d0c6b8334fa838e7d1c875b24c58c1384 )
T 1524679254 18<rgrunber18>	i mean yes, there was an issue with data in the orbit bundle, but equinox was ultimately what decided to loop infinitely.

T 1524683488 18<TruPilot18>	Hi all :-) I'm having difficulty using PDT. Since upgrading, any PHP file I open now comes up in an internal new tab as expected, but it shows up with the TextWrangler logo and doesn't show the outline or autocomplete. It's really strange behavior since I updated last evening.
T 1524683508 18<TruPilot18>	Any suggestions?
T 1524683590 18<mbooth18>	TruPilot: What's textwrangler?
T 1524683616 18<TruPilot18>	It's a text-only editor on the Mac
T 1524683657 18<TruPilot18>	Been using Eclipse for years and never seen behavior like this before.
T 1524683690 18<mbooth18>	TruPilot: And textwrangler is some external application, not some eclipse plugin?
T 1524683705 18<TruPilot18>	That's right, mbooth
T 1524683748 18<mbooth18>	TruPilot: What happens when you right-click a file -> open with -> php editor?
T 1524683795 18<TruPilot18>	What's also strange is that I can tell Eclipse to explicitly open the file in the PHP Editor and it still opens in Eclipse as described above.
T 1524683869 18<TruPilot18>	http://screen.ac/3X2K2Q2h0r1V
T 1524685801 18<nitind18>	TruPilot: check the File Associations preference page in Eclipse for what the default editor for *.php files is. It may just be pulling the icon from there. Don't PHP files need to be in a PHP project to provide the Outline and content assist?
T 1524686673 18<TruPilot18>	Good question nitind regarding being in a PHP project.
T 1524686721 18<TruPilot18>	If that's a requirement, I think that's a bug or at least worthy of a feature request given that I've got PHP mode open.
T 1524686730 18<TruPilot18>	(and editing a PHP file)
T 1524686922 18<TruPilot18>	Ok - I confirm. I think that's a bug that in order to provide an outline, a file must be opened within a PHP project.
T 1524686949 18<TruPilot18>	Thanks nitind :-)
T 1524687170 18<black_13_18>	mbooth never got it work had to give up for now
T 1524687342 18<nitind18>	There's no PHP "mode", unless you mean the PHP Perspective. A perspective is really just a predetermined layout and set of active action sets and their key bindings. You have no problem working with the Java Package Explorer there if you were to open it.
T 1524687391 18<nitind18>	How would it know what content assist to provide without the settings you give it in a PHP Project?

T 1525102941 18<Mattia900918>	surial, so what do I have to do to debug my web app?
T 1525102961 18<surial18>	I don't personally use either tomcat or web servlet / war runners in general.
T 1525103024 18<surial18>	So, you'd have to do a little research. Specifically: [A] figure out the 'entry point' to start tomcat from eclipse. This is easy: You can configure jars or classpath in the 'create debug target' window, and enter the main class, similar to how you run tomcat from the command line. [B] how do you tell tomcat that the class files to be run aren't in a war, but are in a directory? Find out, and configure that. POint it at

T 1525104349 18<Mattia900918>	surial, I think that is not so easy. I have tried tu run/debug my project in eclipse in many different ways, but everything I have tried fails to properly compile and run the project. I finally concluded that you propably can compile and run an ant project only through an ant compiler, because the "normal" builder doesn't know how to read/compile your project... but I don't know, because with java/servlets/eclipse I'm a newbie. I found
T 1525104349 18<Mattia900918>	pieces of information here and there in the web, but I have not found any step-by-step tutorial to make sure I do everything in the correct way.
T 1525104373 18<surial18>	So, everything you tried failed, you try yet another thing (have eclipse run ant for you), that fails too, but nevertheless THAT is the thing you wanna do.
T 1525104392 18<surial18>	I have no idea why you jumped to that conclusion, but, it was the wrong conclusion. Do it the way I told you to, if you run into trouble with it, ask questions about that part. I gotta run.
T 1525105304 18<Mattia900918>	surial, I know how to start a debug session with tomcat: I have tried it and it was succesfull. The problem is that breakpoints were not hitted. However, tomcat doesn't run WAR files. It unpackets war file and then it simply read the code in a directory...
T 1525105731 18<nitind18>	Waaait, you *do* have the web tools installed with its support for Tomcat, right?
T 1525105827 18<nitind18>	Or at least have your javac ant task call set with debug=true?
T 1525105933 18<Mattia900918>	ntind... I can create a tomcat web server with eclipse, so I'd say I have it. I installed and configured my eclipse for web projects
T 1525106588 18<Mattia900918>	Ok, I've created a new project in eclipse by importing the war file from tomcat. Eclipse created a project to be runed and debug without ant... and everything works fine. I'm debugging my project inside eclipse. Fine!
