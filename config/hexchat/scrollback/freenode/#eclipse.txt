T 1516518371 18<Kemikals18>	So have a question. I'm using java, and using Eclipse 4.7.2. Was doing a homework assignment and noticed this. Using Scanner and nextInt , it should disregard carriage return. Though when I run it in eclipse, I have to press enter twice for it to take the value using nextInt. When I compile and run from command line though, it behaves as expected.

(and then repeat the last line you entered after the import was made)
T 1517481828 18<beatbrot18>	Hey guys: Is there something less obstrusive than a MessageDialog in Eclipse? Something like a notification :)  And if yes, how can I create one?

T 1518137850 18<Elec_A18>	Thank you. My question is about including the parent directory name in #include. like in Box2D library (https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D) all headers start with "Box2D/...". However, I can compile this library with Clion but not with Eclipse. In Eclipse I need to change include lines from "Box2D/Dynamics/Joints/b2GearJoint.h" to "../../Joints/b2GearJoint.h" to make it work.

T 1518206811 18<WillPittenger18>	I've been getting grief since I tried to upgrade my Neon installation to Oxygen.  It failed to install in the existing directory.  So I tried to uninstall everything and reinstall, but I couldn't find the uninstall entries.  Nor could I find the Start Menu items that were supposedly created.  (That option was checked.)  So I deleted the program folder and tried to reinstall.  The reinstall...
T 1518206813 18<WillPittenger18>	...seemed to succeed, but when I run the app, I get the error "The Eclipse executable launcher was unable to locate its companion shared library."
T 1518206991 18<WillPittenger18>	I should note the default location is wrong for most versions of Windows.  It should be something inside either %ProgramFiles% or %ProgramFiles(x86)%.  Both are locations protected by UAC.  That would ensure that malware can't change Eclipse's executables without the user being informed.

T 1518237255 18<janis18>	There was an issue in eclipse that was bugging me for a long time. I finally got a round to digging through the code base to find out what was wrong. I created a patch and uploaded it to gerrit. What I could not do is testing my own patch. The bug is in eclipse.platform.swt(gtk). So I would have to rebuild swt with my changes, replace the corresponding jar in the plugin directory, and run eclipse. However,
T 1518237261 18<janis18>	maven seems to hate me. Whenever I try to build swt it tells me that the build artifact differs from the baseline and thus replaces it with the baseline. How can I build swt with my patches? Or is there a better development cycle?

T 1518277470 18<mbooth18>	janis: Hmm, might be a bug if that doesn't work :-(  Suppose you could always just get rid of that plugin. It's probably configured in the platform parent pom.
T 1518280993 18<janis18>	mbooth: Okay I found a line <baselineReplace>all<... and replaces all with none. Now it no longer seems to replase my changes. Thanks

T 1518556666 18<cheako18>	Hello, I'm working with vulkan via glsl and tool tips for functions are miss-matched.  Pulling up the tool tip for vkCreateGraphicsPipelines shows the definition for vkCreateInstance.  I quit and re-opened and this is still the case.
T 1518558289 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	royal_screwup21: To be clear, it isn't "jee" or some variation that is the issue. You're trying to use the Mars version, which is too old.
T 1518558429 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	royal_screwup21: Ok, actually, I don't know if Mars is too old. As nitind says, Luna (3.8.1) is too old. In any case, there are a full two major versions that were released after Mars.
T 1518558665 18<nitind18>	3.8.1 wasn't Luna. It was Juno, two full releases back from Luna.
T 1518558724 18<nitind18>	The 4.x releases coincidentally line up with the year, 4.1 being 2011, 3.8/4.2 being 2012's.
T 1518569405 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	I have a new project to work on. I cloned the git repo, and I built it successfully with mvn from the command line. I then imported the project from my git repo, but the eclipse project has errors. The icon has the "m" in the top left and the "J" in the top right, with the little disk icon below that. It believes it's a maven project, but it has lots of errors that make it seem like it can't find its

I tried to add "Maven Managed Dependencies" as a library, but it says "use Maven Project settings to configure Maven dependency resolution".

T 1518619485 18<beatbrot18>	hey guys: I have the following problem: I want to add a contextmenu-entry to all projects. In the past, i did this by extending org.eclipse.ui.menus and setting "popup:org.eclipse.jdt.ui.PackageExplorer?before=additions" as locationURI. This is however, not exactly what I want, as now, the menu only appears in the package-explorer and e.g. not in F
T 1518619485 18<beatbrot18>	PackageExplorer. Other plugins do this via org.eclipse.ui.popupmenus. But this seems to be deprecated. Do you have any tip for me?
T 1518625115 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	I still have the same problem I had yesterday. I imported a maven project from git (two different ways), and it doesn't have "Maven Dependencies" in the libraries, so I get red marks for all the dependencies. What do I have to "kick" to make it generate the .classpath correctly?
T 1518632071 18<nitind_18>	davidmichaelkarr Did you import using the Maven import wizard?
T 1518632162 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind_: I did it two different ways, both with basically the same result.  I first right-clicked on the git repo and selected import.  I've used this successfully for Maven projects many times. I then tried deleting the project and then going to the main "Import" menu and selecting "Existing Maven Projects".  That was the last one I tried.
T 1518632263 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind_: When I deleted the project the first time, as I wasn't deleting the git repo, I wonder if the .classpath file was still there when I tried to import again, and it decided to use that instead of regenerating it.
T 1518632409 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind_: I'm attempting to reimport using that path, but first deleting the .classpath and .project files. It'll take a minute.
T 1518632653 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind_: Sheesh. Now it doesn't know it's a java project. It knows it's maven, but that's all.
T 1518633431 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind_: I just tried deleting the project, then deleting the .project, .classpath, and .settings from the git repo, then reimporting with "Existing Maven Projects".  The result is, it's a Maven project, but not Java (icon has "M", but no "J").
T 1518633894 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind_: I posted https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48792070/maven-project-imported-to-eclipse-from-git-is-missing-maven-dependencies-libra#48793767 with more details. My post to m2e-users got crickets.
T 1518634391 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind_: At this point, I guess I'm just going to compare the .project and .classpath files for a working project, and hand-edit the files in the project. This is broken.
T 1518634879 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind_: Well, that worked.  I hope I don't have to do that again.
T 1518635504 18<nitind18>	How...why make it a Maven project but not a Java Project?
T 1518635794 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind_: Not sure what you're asking me.  Are you asking why Eclipse didn't make it a Java project?  I have no idea..

T 1518637545 18<cheako18>	I deleted the project and recreated it and this has fixed the issue.
T 1518639345 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	So now I have a new problem. I have no idea whether it's unrelated to my earlier weird problem with importing a maven project.
T 1518639384 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	The new app is a spring boot app.  When I run it as a "Java Application", I just get an error dialog box with a red X and not a single bit of information.  There's nothing in the log file.
T 1518639407 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	I tried running an existing spring boot app that I have, and it runs fine the same way.
T 1518640711 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	It seems like when I run it as a plain java application, it does this, but when I run the specific springboot run configuration, it works fine.
