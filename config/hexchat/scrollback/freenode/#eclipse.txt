T 1528906303 18<panzi18>	It looks like its a problem with the UI of eclipse and not the theme, because it is like that with all the dark themes.

T 1531817359 18<b3h3m0th18>	Is there a way to view static code issues as an when I feed lines of code?
T 1531817461 18<b3h3m0th18>	Using the Eclipse IDE I mean. Basically I want to spot issues in my code then and there before I do an entire fortify build.

T 1531901712 18<mlevitsk18>	I am annoyed that each EXPORT_SYMBOL macro which eclipse does find, creates bunch of unused (these are indeed unused but used by kernel loader) variables
T 1531901724 18<mlevitsk18>	so I wanted to re define it as empty string
T 1531901819 18<mlevitsk18>	I suspect that user defined macros are only used when eclipse can't find a definition somewhere :(
T 1531902014 18<mbooth18>	mlevitsk: I mean, if you can't give me a example illustrating the problem, it's difficult to help :-(

T 1531902371 18<mlevitsk18>	I created a dummy header file with the dummy macro definition. That works

T 1531914157 18<kveeni18>	surely i can just ignore these warnings, but perhaps i have to change the java version?
T 1531914183 18<kveeni18>	for instance List<String> foo = new ArrayList<>(); gives a warning "ArrayList is a raw type"
T 1531917298 18<mbooth18>	kveeni: That should be perfectly valid on Java 7 or newer, IIRC. Is that warning corresponding to a different line?

T 1531917548 18<mbooth18>	kveeni: Right, that means your project isn't a Java 7 project. Try changing the compliance level in the project properties.
T 1531917618 18<kveeni18>	where do i do that exactly in the properties menu?
T 1531917647 18<kveeni18>	this is a Maven project, does it matter?
T 1531917689 18<mbooth18>	kveeni: Do you set the source/target in the pom.xml?
T 1531917729 18<mbooth18>	kveeni: In Eclipse, right-click your project -> properties -> java compiler
T 1531917752 18<kveeni18>	i didnt :)
T 1531917839 18<kveeni18>	setting it in pom.xml didn't seem to affect anything

T 1531917901 18<kveeni18>	is that setting something i should everytime override?
T 1531917943 18<mbooth18>	kveeni: No, you can change the default for all projects if you like

T 1532356068 18<coderguy18>	I've done the steps shown here, https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform-releng/Platform_Build. Now what?

T 1532356302 18<mbooth18>	What do you want to do?
T 1532356386 18<coderguy18>	How do I import the JDT sources into Eclipse. It's not obvious how to import the sources. Is it a plug? or a maven project.

T 1532356431 18<coderguy18>	Which of the multitude of directories need to be included.

T 1532356458 18<rgrunber18>	coderguy: my workflow has always been : import the sources as eclipse projects, and create a target platform from the 4.8-I-builds..
T 1532356475 18<mbooth18>	coderguy: You can just clone the repo containing the plugin you want and do "import project" from the git repositories view
T 1532356480 18<coderguy18>	I'm looking to see if I can run some static analysis tools on the codebase, and maybe even fix a bug or two.
T 1532356582 18<coderguy18>	I'm not sure I follow what you mean by create a target platform? I'm building from eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator from the linked article.
T 1532356647 18<coderguy18>	That's why I'm looking for some simple docs. I just want to have a look not spend weeks reading. :-)
T 1532356661 18<mbooth18>	coderguy: So you are interested in building the aggregator? Or interested in one plugin only?
T 1532356722 18<coderguy18>	I want to build the SDK from source, then use that version to work with the JDT plugins that are contained in the same repo.
T 1532356786 18<mbooth18>	coderguy: The aggregator is an aggregation of various repos included as git submodules.
T 1532356862 18<mbooth18>	coderguy: But once you built the SDK from source, you can run generated SDK product as use it as you normally would
T 1532356890 18<mbooth18>	coderguy: But there's no requirement to build *everything* if you are working on only one plugin ;-)
T 1532356961 18<coderguy18>	That's why I'm looking for a getting started guide. The wiki is overwhelming.
T 1532357102 18<mbooth18>	coderguy: As I say, I usually just clone a specific repo and import the project. Then you can develop as normal. If you are working specifically on the JDT, they have a contributors FAQ:  https://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_Core_Committer_FAQ
T 1532357125 18<coderguy18>	Thanks, I'll take a look.
T 1532357129 18<mbooth18>	coderguy: But it's really no more complex than: clone, import, code, run :-)
T 1532371135 18<nitind18>	mbooth: Isn't there an import wizard for importing sources?
T 1532482415 18<def_18>	Hello. I'm using Eclipse Photon on Ubuntu 18.04. MarketPlace doesn't show its window when I choose its menu item. Also drag'n'drop "install" button from Firefox to workspace show window for install but the button "Confirm" is disabled.

T 1532968015 18<MarkoZajc18>	Hi! For some reason, in Preferences > Java > Editor > Content Assist > Advanced, when I check the checkbox next to "Chain Proposals (Code Recommenders)", no chain proposals show up when I hit Ctrl + Space, and when I do, the check in the checkbox disappears next time I open preferences. Chain proposals do however show in quick assist. Can someone help me get chain proposals into content assist (Ctrl + Space) window?

T 1532968040 18<Arbalest18>	Please state a) your Eclipse version, and b) where you got Eclipse from (eclipse.org, Linux distro repository, etc.). If from eclipse.org, the actual filename. c) your CPU architecture (x86, 64-bit, etc.), d) operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.), e) your Java Runtime Environment (please verify by checking your ~logs or in the about dialog's ~jre section. Typing 'java -version' in the command line does not count as checking).
