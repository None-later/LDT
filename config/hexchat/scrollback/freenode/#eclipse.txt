T 1471453574 18<Frigid_Cryotank18>	Or does Eclipse view them as all being required for an executable in the top level project?  (and now I'm not sure I'm phrasing the question properly).

T 1471460412 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Frigid_Cryotank: A package is just a namespace mechanism, so you can arrange classes in sensible functional groups.  A package is not "executable".
T 1471461933 18<Frigid_Cryotank18>	So if I have multiple source files inside a package, and one source imports a class from another java source file in the same package (namespace) then "all should be well" ...?
T 1471462005 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Frigid_Cryotank: I don't know about that, but if you reference a class in the same package as the referencing class, you don't have to import it.
T 1471462023 18<nitind18>	Import just lets you use the unqualified name of a type to refer to it, either by importing that type's fully qualified name or all the contents of a package (with the .*). You don't need to import types from the same package--that's the first place the compiler will look for types you refer to anyway.
T 1471462078 18<Frigid_Cryotank18>	Apologies for it being ..cryptic.  What I've been doing is working my way through a tutorial on Java.  Each section of the tutorial has multiple problems... and I was wondering if Eclipse would let me organize all these separate projects into a hierarchy of projects.
T 1471462150 18<Frigid_Cryotank18>	So there would be a "Strings" "project"... and under that would be a Project for the first problem, another for the second problem..
T 1471462177 18<Frigid_Cryotank18>	Which probably looks terrible as far as the filesystem goes... but it's all about organizing things anyway...
T 1471462213 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Frigid_Cryotank: That's not really practical.  It is possible to use "tasks", or "Mylyn", so that when you're working on the "strings" task, you can limit what you see to projects related to that.
T 1471462246 18<nitind18>	Unless you're going to have projects that aren't for these problems, they're already in a group of sorts by being in a single workspace.
T 1471462648 18<Frigid_Cryotank18>	Re: Mylyn: I'm still plodding my way through simple Java material.  But I think I see the point.  So... having separate projects for all these little problems is the way to go (for the moment).
T 1471462807 18<Frigid_Cryotank18>	I was having a Terrible time with Neon under Slackware Linux.  The default GTK interface has far too much whitespace with the buttons, borders, just everything.  Setting Preferences --> General --> Appearance to "Classic" just didn't work... then found an old post saying "export SWT_GTK3=0"  .. and, oh my, that made Neon extremely responsive.

T 1471552182 18<defanco18>	Ran into a bit of an issue with Eclipse that I think could've been avoided. I have a plugin that has Scala nature, other developer checked out this plugin and tries to run it in product, but gets ClassNotFoundException on one of the classes in the plugin. Of course we forget that this plugin has Scala nature and thus expects Scala Builder that we don't have because we don't have Scala IDE installed. The question is why didn't Eclips
T 1471552182 18<defanco18>	e throw some kind of error into Console informing of this fact?
T 1471552273 18<defanco18>	I think these kind of errors are common but hard to diagnose because NoClassFoundException can mean many things being wrong with the plugin
T 1471552586 18<defanco18>	And I think in this particular situation solution is even more simpler since if UI is smart enough to mark Builder as missing, it could go extra step and log warning in the console...
T 1471562090 18<zave_18>	hello, does anyone know what to do about this error "The BPMN Diagram element is not enabled in this Tool Profile"? i think it's the reason why when i drag events into the diagram, they won't stick. am i on the right track?
T 1471590954 18<jablo18>	Swithced to a high-resolution (4K) display. Oh my, now Eclipse is almost unusable due to slooooow scrolling.
T 1471591053 18<jablo18>	I switched from Netbeans to Eclipse for that reason. Now I fear I'll have to switch to Qtcreator (we're a C++/Qt shop).
T 1471591460 18<mvvvv18>	jablo, what is your GPU ?
T 1471591727 18<jablo18>	It's a Dell M3800. GPU is Nvidia Quadro K1100M GPU as far as I know
T 1471591732 18<jablo18>	Linux, Ubuntu 14.04
T 1471591828 18<jablo18>	Oh - I'm using X.Org X server -- Nouveau display driver. Maybe I should try the NVIDIA binary driver.
T 1471592551 18<jablo18>	No. Even using NVIDIA binary driver, mouse-wheel scrolling is horribly slow. Eclipse can't keep up and is lagging 10s of seconds behind.
T 1471592581 18<jablo18>	(sigh. I hate QtCreator and only use it when I absolutely have to in some debug sessions)
T 1471592686 18<mvvvv18>	jablo, do you know what is your kernel version ?

T 1471592812 18<mvvvv18>	jablo, I know that kernel 4.4 (ubuntu 16.04) has  dramatically enhanced the free video drivers
T 1471592910 18<jablo18>	Oh. Interesting. Maybe that's a reason for upgrading (ie. re-installing), I was thinking of waiting for the .1 release and do an in-place upgrade instead. Hmm,.
T 1471592960 18<jablo18>	QtCreator in comparison is lightning fast. Netbeans was horribly slow even on normal HD resolution. Eclipse is nice and fast on HD resolution, but can't keep up on 4K
T 1471592962 18<mvvvv18>	jablo, on the other hand I've seen many problems with nvidia drivers on 16.04

T 1471594334 18<mvvvv18>	Yes to use GTK2 libs instead of GTK3
T 1471594351 18<mvvvv18>	this workaround can save performance

T 1471594848 18<mvvvv18>	jablo, don't think cause Netbeans do not use GTK
T 1471595130 18<jablo18>	I really need to clean up my workflow. I love Eclipse for editing C++ files, and need to use QtCreator for debugging when there's a need to inspect and evaluate Qt data structures, but I use Netbeans for resolving git merge/rebase conflicts.

T 1471595338 18<jablo18>	Hmm. I rarely dare use guis for git commands. Most git commands I use the command line - then for conflict resolution I like Netbeans graphical representation. I'm a strange person, I guess.

T 1472483200 18<mistria18>	Lone_Rifle mvvvv: https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ecafaq.php , the Eclipse contributor License agreement has to be signed on the Eclipse Profile page https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/myaccount.php#open_tab_cla
T 1472483269 18<mvvvv18>	mistria For Github ??
T 1472483312 18<mistria18>	mvvvv: I believe so, IIRC, Eclipse adds an additional IP check which verifies one has signed the Eclipse Contributor Agreement
T 1472483330 18<mistria18>	mvvvv: it's reported like a test pass or failure
T 1472483401 18<mistria18>	mvvvvv: see https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/2234 for an example, the "ip-validation" at the bottom

T 1472483561 18<enleeten18>	could it be something with that new contributor agreement?

T 1472487882 18<TML18>	Is there a way to make "Eclipse Intaller.app" use my existing, fully functional JDK instead of looking for Apple's unsupported, legacy 1.6 JDK?
T 1472499652 18<purplex8818>	In Eclipse Java, If I type 'S' it brings up a long autocomplete list of stuff that starts with 'S' and when I press backspace to delete 'S' the autocomplete list doesn't go away.
T 1472499688 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	purplex88: Press Escape.
T 1472499751 18<purplex8818>	can i make it work with backpace?

T 1472499769 18<purplex8818>	list still being there seems unnecessary if i delete it
T 1472499939 18<nitind18>	Did you set it to automatically show the list when you type 'S'?
