T 1492065476 18<BW^-18>	it must be the suffix "lib" that makes Eclipse not list it?

T 1492087138 18<ssarah18>	apupier, tyvm. But what I meant was that now when I download eclipse for linux 64, it comes in the form of a tar.gz with an installer inside it.
T 1492087166 18<ssarah18>	And all I wanted was something like a directory where I extract it and run a binary and eclise

T 1492087455 18<apupier18>	ssarah in fact you can choose the package you want and then install PyDev in it
T 1492087480 18<apupier18>	I think that the closer package to previous "Eclipse classic package" is Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
T 1492087545 18<ssarah18>	yes. So i picked the top one Eclipse installer. I already eclipse geppetto and eclipse ee in my system.
