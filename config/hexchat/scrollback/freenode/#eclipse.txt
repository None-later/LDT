T 1515703665 18<Xophosaurus18>	yes, through the updates in the list... i would have assumed it would have picked up the required dependancies, but i can double check that EMF, GEF, XSD, etc.. are installed
T 1515703711 18<nitind18>	It will get the dependencies, but which feature did you explicitly choose when installing?

T 1516054998 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	@nitind I don't know what that could do besides convincing you it is happening.  It's simply going to show those buffers being removed and then reappearing on eclipse restart.
T 1516055452 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	@nitind Well, I just tried it a second ago, and one thing I noted is that immediately after restart I didn't see it happen.  It was only after a few seconds, when I think it went through some "setup steps" (don't remember the exact name it showed) that the formerly removed buffers suddenly reappeared in the list.

T 1517353645 18<nitind18>	If File|Open Projects from File System doesn't allow them in, physically move the projects to a different location and open them from there. They don't have to physically be under the workspace directory to be usable.
T 1517353666 18<dhaller18>	yeah that's what I had to do

T 1517417356 18<Megaf18>	Hi folks, hows things? For some reason my eclipse is not showing line numbers, how do I make it show the line numbers? In a Java workplace if it matters.
T 1517417416 18<mbooth18>	Megaf: Type "line numbers" into the search box in the preferences dialog
T 1517417534 18<Megaf18>	Had to type just line, anyway, that worked, thanks mbooth
T 1517417536 18<Megaf18>	why would it be disabled by default tho?
T 1517417597 18<mbooth18>	Megaf: Because most people don't use it probably. Takes up valuable screen space, and you can just hit Ctrl+L to navigate to a line number
T 1517417629 18<Megaf18>	ctrl l, that works too

If you have errors or logs to show, see ~pastebin. If you have screenshots to share, see ~image. You need to describe your problem in detail,so  please provide some ~info about your setup. Don't ask to ask, just ask. You might also want to try http://mattermost.eclipse.org
T 1517424235 18<xata18>	Here is the problem. I am using eclipse CDT and when i ctrl-lmb on the function it finds it, ok, but in another project in current workspace, and i don't want to find structures and functions in that project from my current project
T 1517424276 18<xata18>	In general - how do i isolate project's index from another project
T 1517429550 18<nitind18>	Megaf: It's on by default in recent releases.
T 1517429584 18<Megaf18>	Thanks nitind. I'm indeed using an old version I think
T 1517429591 18<Megaf18>	Don't really mind
T 1517472570 18<pZombie18>	 how difficult would it be to write a plugin for eclipse which has a tab that mirrors exactly what jshell does, except that when you hit enter and there is a symbol that was not imported yet but part of the standard library, it would pop up a window to let you choose which import to make? (and then repeat the last line you entered after the import was made)
T 1517481828 18<beatbrot18>	Hey guys: Is there something less obstrusive than a MessageDialog in Eclipse? Something like a notification :)  And if yes, how can I create one?
T 1517481878 18<mbooth18>	beatbrot: You mean like mylyn notifications? I think you can use the mylyn notification framework in your own plugins
T 1517481968 18<beatbrot18>	Alright, will look into that :)
T 1517482033 18<beatbrot18>	mbooth Do you know If i can add a button or something similar to a notification? Something I can click on :)
T 1517482106 18<mbooth18>	beatbrot: Yeah, I believe the EPP error logging plugin uses a notification to ask if you want to enable or disable error reporting, for example.
T 1517482117 18<beatbrot18>	Alright, thank you very much!
T 1517482261 18<mbooth18>	beatbrot: I suppose you can find example usage of the notification framework by looking in this plugin: http://git.eclipse.org/c/epp/org.eclipse.epp.logging.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.epp.logging.aeri.ide
T 1517482427 18<beatbrot18>	Thanks again! Very kind of you :)
