T 1469549902 18<mistria18>	CustosL1men: you can try the antBuilder application, and pass an Ant build.xml file
T 1469550035 18<CustosL1men18>	cant I somehow get maven to build eclipse projects ?
T 1469550398 18<mistria18>	CustosL1men: what do you ,mean bu Eclipse projects? Eclipse plugins? or regular Java projects?
T 1469550480 18<CustosL1men18>	mistria, regular java projects like this: http://termbin.com/wbut
T 1469550568 18<mistria18>	CustosL1men: ok, so yes, they can be built with Maven. But this task is independent from the IDE. The IDE can help and will understand Maven, but once your project is Maven based, you simply build it with Maven, no need for the IDE to build.
T 1469550615 18<CustosL1men18>	mistria, see - I just want a simple straight forward way to generate jars for like 20 projects like this from command line
T 1469550637 18<CustosL1men18>	normally I use maven as base - but people who made these projects did not
T 1469550653 18<CustosL1men18>	and I'm trying to figure out how to get this to build automatically for me to jars
T 1469550798 18<mistria18>	CustosL1men: the best way is to migrate this project to Maven. You can automate Eclipse export with Ant, but it's a PITA to maintain such approach
T 1469550898 18<CustosL1men18>	ok - let me see about adding pom.xml files
T 1469550929 18<CustosL1men18>	thanks for help mistria - really means allot ;)
T 1469550945 18<CustosL1men18>	I normally just use vim + maven
T 1469550958 18<CustosL1men18>	so I'm a bit overwhelmed by this IDE stuff
T 1469551587 18<mistria18>	CustosL1men: there's for sure a learning curve, but it's wrth iy
T 1469551596 18<mistria18>	worth it
T 1469551618 18<dan18>	Hi, I just wanted to know, howcome Eclipse does not support JavaFX by default? Is JavaFX considered "dead"?
T 1469551620 18<CustosL1men18>	mistria, for me not really - vim > - but anyway - main challenge is to just get this stuff auto building from command line
T 1469551763 18<mistria18>	CustosL1men: vim is for sure an awesome editor. But automated build, awesome completion, debug, instant error reporting... Even if typimg cam be slower, all the other tools make coding good things easier
T 1469551789 18<CustosL1men18>	mistria, but IMO automated build just inside maven is not usefull
T 1469551806 18<CustosL1men18>	instant error reporting is nice, and auto completion is nice - but not that nice that I ever miss it
T 1469551818 18<CustosL1men18>	<CustosL1men> mistria, but IMO automated build just inside maven is not usefull < I mean just inside eclipse
T 1469551839 18<CustosL1men18>	like I said normally I juse maven - and then for people who want to use eclipse its no problem - but other way round is serious issue IMO
T 1469551857 18<CustosL1men18>	if I cant build something easily from command line its a failure
T 1469551949 18<mistria18>	CustomL1men: I agree about build shouldn't require IDE
T 1469551986 18<mistria18>	CustomL1men: however, the last versions of Maven support in Eclipse IDE sometimes have pretty good completion. Infering parameters and documentation.

T 1470340756 18<jrtappers18>	It seems to be ok if I have a static method that sets the values and manually call it before getting the values [removing the final], but not if it is declared and assigned together, although this seems like a messy workaround
