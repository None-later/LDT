T 1510761583 18<badloop18>	i'm using maven to build a java project that executes embedded groovy code.  when i execute it locally, i get all the nice error messages from the groovy side of things, but when i use maven to compile and its running the tests, they are dying in the groovy code somewhere, but i dont know where because there is no output

T 1510761659 18<badloop18>	the build is being done remotely on my gitlab runner server, so i'm assuming its probably a maven config change that i could make, but i'm clueless as to where to look (still green when it comes to end-to-end dev using CI)

T 1510832721 18<c-c18>	haha I must be the strangest person - wanting console and .java files in the same window. I keep struggling. The old STS 3.6 at least didn't throw the opened files seemingly randomly between shared area and other places. (no, reset p doesn't help)

You can delete the project from the workspace (do NOT delete the underlying files from the working tree), and then just rearrange things as you need to. The biggest caution is that the .project file's declaration of the project's name and the name of the folder that it's in are usually the same, and that anything referring to contents
