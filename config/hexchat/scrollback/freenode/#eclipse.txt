T 1509897100 18<Matt181218>	Hello all - I'm new to Eclipse but have been doing development for a while, and just trying to play with the IDE.  Using CDT for C++ programming, and a few things about the GUI are just driving me crazy, that I'm hoping there's an easy answer to that I'm just not finding via Google.  Both of these are using the Dark theme, which I really like and was one of the main draws, Eclipse 4.7.1a, Linux Debian Jessie (8)
T 1509897100 18<Matt181218>	 is the development VM (I cannot upgrade that), running openjdk-8-jre from jessie-backports (Version 8u131).  First off, the menu bar is black text on a very dark gray background - nearly impossible to read.  The second issue is something similar in the build console window - normal messages from the compiler are also black text on a dark gray background.  I fix both, kind of, with doing "export SWT_GTK3=0" as
T 1509897100 18<Matt181218>	 suggested by https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=436753, but the moment I click into the build window to do anything, the background goes from white to black again.
T 1509897355 18<Matt181218>	The other problem with the SWT_GTK3=0 trick is it makes checkboxes and some other GUI elements white-on-white, and impossible to see the state of :(
T 1509897458 18<Matt181218>	So I guess, in short, what I need to know is: a) Without using SWT_GTK3, how do I get the menu bar's background color corrected, and b) How do I change the default text foreground color in the Console tab from black to white?

T 1509898328 18<Matt181218>	My other option is to run Eclipse on a different, up-to-date machine, but I would need to use the compiler, linker, includes, etc. on the remote machine.  A Google search seemed to indicate I could do this with a "Remote C++" project and an RDT server, but that was looking rather messy to set up
T 1509898365 18<Matt181218>	And it wasn't clear if things like the Indexer would actually work like I want like that

T 1511885080 18<xbb_18>	I want to add http://borisvl.github.io/Pdf4Eclipse/ to my plugins. I added site to my target defintion and add feature to my feature, when I run from source I can use the pdf viewer (provided by the plugin I want to use), but when I build I get error about missing p2 metadata repository. I think I can make the legacy update site work with p2, but fail to remember how. Is there somekind of directive in Tycho files?
T 1511885247 18<xbb_18>	Related question, how can I programatically open PDF files in system in editor - looks like without plugin on Windows the PDF files are opening in text editor
T 1511887365 18<mbooth18>	xbb_: IIRC, tycho only supports new-style p2 update sites -- http://borisvl.github.io/Pdf4Eclipse/ is an old-style update site without p2 metadata
T 1511887406 18<xbb_18>	that's what I thought...so I guess I need to build the site myself then
T 1511887423 18<mbooth18>	Last change was 2012? This probably pre-dates p2 and tycho :-)
T 1511887431 18<xbb_18>	Yup
T 1511887498 18<mbooth18>	xbb_: Or bug the author to update it
T 1511887527 18<mbooth18>	Pretty soon Eclipse's support for this kind of update site will be deprecated and removed
T 1511887540 18<xbb_18>	I might do that
T 1511887641 18<xbb_18>	Without doing that, how can I open PDF files in Eclispe using system editor rather that default editor (which is text). It seems that PDF files that I generate are not opening in external PDF editor, but internal text editor.
T 1511887927 18<mbooth18>	xbb_: When you right-click a file in project explorer/package explorer do you not get an option "Open With -> System Editor" ?
T 1511888019 18<xbb_18>	I need process to be automated because file is being opened by clicking on a button in View
T 1511888159 18<mbooth18>	xbb_: Have you tried simply adding file association in preferences? You can associate a file type with an external program
T 1511888297 18<xbb_18>	But that will only work for my case, when other people use the program then they might not have the same app
T 1511888619 18<mbooth18>	xbb_: Yep, and opening in system editor is also only guaranteed work in your case. (What if user has no PDF reader installed, for example?)
T 1511888663 18<xbb_18>	right
T 1511888716 18<xbb_18>	I guess associating pdf with Chrome is a possibility since pretty much everyone has that
T 1511888720 18<xbb_18>	installed
T 1511888729 18<mbooth18>	Except me ;-)
T 1511888815 18<xbb_18>	did you switch to Firefox like me? :)
T 1511888842 18<mbooth18>	I am a firefox user, yeah.
