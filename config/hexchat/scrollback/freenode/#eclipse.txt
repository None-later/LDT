But in the console I read "collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status. make: *** [myProject] error 1 makefile:45 : the recipy to the target <<myProject>> has failed.".

T 1519824616 18<surial18>	donald: well, your make file runs the ld command and that exits with an error.

T 1519826321 18<surial18>	eclipse runs the make tool. The make tool opens a file named 'Makefile', in the root of the project presumably (I have little experience with make or C++ building). make is really just a bunch of linux shell commands. One of them here is 'ld'. ld is the linker. It's part of compilation on certain platforms.
T 1519826344 18<surial18>	The make file is running and there is no error in the structure of it, so 'targets have been removed' doesn't sound like the problem. The ld line in the makefile is borked.

T 1519827980 18<surial18>	donald: But forget the g++ part. The make file runs 'ld' AFTER that. And THAT fails. g++ is irrelevant.

T 1520569620 18<nitind_18>	Try removing the binding from one of them.
T 1520590771 18<masber18>	good afternoon, is there a way to run java code during debug break?
T 1520592811 18<mbooth18>	masber: If you mean "can I run the code I am debugging" yes, just hit F5/F6 to step through the code or F8 to run to the next breakpoint.
T 1520592814 18<mbooth18>	masber: If you mean run some unrelated code, then yes, just create a new run configuration.
T 1520593054 18<mbooth18>	masber: If you mean "execute some expression within the context of the current stackframe" yes, open up the "expressions" view and enter it there
T 1520593095 18<mbooth18>	masber: If you mean something else, I'm afraid you'll need to be more specific :-)
T 1520615458 18<donald18>	what is the command to get the path to a library installed with apt install in linux? I need it to import libraries into eclipse to his linkage and compiler. I do not have a clear idea of the type of files I have to link.
T 1520615605 18<mbooth18>	donald: System libraries are usually installed into /usr/lib or /usr/lib64
T 1520615662 18<enleeten18>	@donald the packages in debian tend to be named like libfoo
T 1520615668 18<enleeten18>	for various library
T 1520615684 18<enleeten18>	so you just need to install that and possibly the -dev variant, which will include headers for compiling against
T 1520615707 18<enleeten18>	so like apt-get install libfoo and apt-get install libfoo-dev
T 1520615715 18<enleeten18>	or just apt for newer versions
T 1520615902 18<donald18>	enleeten: I want to install boost/beast. I have already installed boost but not beast
T 1520616032 18<mbooth18>	I don't know what beast is; this doesn't sound like an Eclipse question. Maybe they can help you in #debian ;-)
T 1520616181 18<enleeten18>	looks like beast and beast2 are in apt
T 1520616232 18<enleeten18>	oh you prob mean boost beast
T 1520616867 18<donald18>	yes
T 1520616876 18<donald18>	enleeten: I mean boost beast
T 1520616999 18<enleeten18>	looking at it, it's header only, so you really just need to check it out from github and make sure it's on your include path
T 1520617018 18<enleeten18>	so its not like you need to build beast into a lib and link that
T 1520617070 18<donald18>	I can not download with apt install???
T 1520617085 18<enleeten18>	I don't see it in apt, so perhaps not
T 1520617100 18<donald18>	ok
T 1520617103 18<enleeten18>	just clone the latest release version from github and put it on your project's include path
T 1520617121 18<enleeten18>	if you have a compatible version of boost installed locally (and any other deps), should just work :)
T 1520617415 18<donald18>	I just clone it. how to link it now?
T 1520617453 18<donald18>	if you have a compatible version of boost installed locally (and any other deps), should just work :) => Ihave already installed boost via apt. are you sure I need to clone  beast?
T 1520617834 18<enleeten18>	yeah unless the boost debs contain beast
T 1520617853 18<enleeten18>	like I said, you don't need to link beast, it's a header only library
T 1520617862 18<donald18>	then I download the repo
T 1520617864 18<enleeten18>	you just need it on your include paths when you compile
T 1520617869 18<donald18>	ah ok
T 1520617876 18<enleeten18>	you will need to link against boost libs though
T 1520617919 18<enleeten18>	but those are on your system and presumably you linker path, so you should just need to add the boost lib name(s) when linking
T 1520617944 18<donald18>	let me try that
T 1520618076 18<donald18>	enleeten then if I put everything in /usr/include/ all is rigth?
T 1520618099 18<donald18>	or should I put in /workspace/myProject ?
T 1520618138 18<enleeten18>	you could install it globally, /usr/include is usually managed by the system though, /usr/local/include would be better for manual global install
T 1520618151 18<enleeten18>	but in your project is fine also, if you don't intend on using the library anywhere else
T 1520618230 18<donald18>	cool
T 1520618777 18<donald18>	enleeten then I do #include <beast-develop/include/boost/beast>?
T 1520619000 18<donald18>	It does not works. can you give me the steps?
T 1520619065 18<enleeten18>	once you have the library on your include path (of your compiler command, make file, cmake, whatever)
T 1520619078 18<enleeten18>	you don't need to give an absolute path in your code
T 1520619088 18<enleeten18>	you'd have just boost/beast or something similar
T 1520619109 18<donald18>	then where do I put beast-develop?
T 1520619184 18<enleeten18>	it doesn't matter, so long as that path is on your includes when running the compiler
T 1520619269 18<donald18>	then how to put my files in include? I do not see the include folder in /worskspace
T 1520619481 18<donald18>	enleeten becauser  I can not see the folder
T 1520619496 18<enleeten18>	you may want to ask in one of the C++ channels
T 1520619512 18<donald18>	no
T 1520619543 18<donald18>	I just do no find the way to do it in eclipse nor the physical folder in my computer
T 1520619780 18<enleeten18>	you can typically specify an include path with the compiler, like c++ -I/usr/local/include/beast
T 1520619799 18<enleeten18>	so your code will only have something like #include <boost/beast>
T 1520619813 18<enleeten18>	as the location of the beast library is specified by the compiler flag
T 1520619814 18<donald18>	c++ not g++ ?
T 1520619837 18<enleeten18>	could be either, depending on which compiler family you're using and how they're symlinked
T 1520619865 18<donald18>	x86_64
T 1520619937 18<donald18>	then I do g++ -l/usr/local/include/beast and I do not care where has been installed the /beast folder?
T 1520620103 18<donald18>	enleeten
T 1520620139 18<enleeten18>	-I capital I/i
T 1520620160 18<enleeten18>	and /usr/local/include/beast is where you've installed beast
T 1520620172 18<donald18>	can you gibve the full command?
T 1520620194 18<enleeten18>	that basically is the full command, aside from your sources and libraries to link against
T 1520620233 18<donald18>	no matter where I am?$
T 1520620276 18<enleeten18>	you'd typically be in the project directory
T 1520620344 18<donald18>	can you give me an example and tell me where the command is executed?
T 1520620682 18<donald18>	enleeten ?
T 1520621083 18<enleeten18>	@donald you may get more help in a C++ specific channel, #eclipse is mainly for eclipse ide discussions
T 1520621140 18<donald18>	ok
