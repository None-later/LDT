T 1499718503 18<transhuman18>	I think its a general question for eclipse .."how do i install a python module?"
T 1499718559 18<webczat18>	py-dev is a 3'rd party plugin afaik

For Windows/Linux you can just create a directory named jre inside the eclipse directory and next to features, plugins, configuration, etc.. and copy the contents of the jre into it and Eclipse would use this jre for launching. Does anyone know how to achieve the same thing in MacOS?

T 1499779216 18<daemon87_18>	any pointers? :-)
T 1499779259 18<daemon87_18>	would be great if someone could unblock me, except uninstalling the jboss tools, since that would be annoying :-)

T 1499784665 18<daemon87_18>	that function is called in the 'Start Level: Equinox Container: 710f71bc-337e-4a04-b147-a0153c33' -thread, while the other functions are loaded in the main thread

T 1499784735 18<eclipse-mm18>	<nitind> Why not just not do that there? It's a singleton, ripe for lazy initialization.
T 1499784813 18<daemon87_18>	I was thinking of adding a simple Display.asyncExec with a message in org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter
T 1499784846 18<daemon87_18>	but that wouldn't really be nice :-) Since that class is executed in the main thread ...
T 1499784960 18<daemon87_18>	but it would get rid of all plugins that are using the Display in the start of the bundle, since that could always cause issues with the wrong thread being used I guess
T 1499785042 18<daemon87_18>	<eclipse-mm> if you do this in the start of the bundle it would cause the dreaded 'org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Invalid thread access' since the Display wasn't initialised yet in the main thread
T 1499785053 18<daemon87_18>	i don't know if that makes sense what i'm saying :-)
T 1499785115 18<daemon87_18>	since you have two threads: one because of the lazy initiliaser in 'Start Level: Equinox Container:'-thread and one in the main-thread
T 1499785299 18<daemon87_18>	any idea?
T 1499785490 18<nitind18>	Yes, just don't do that during plug-in start. It's a singleton that will initialize itself the first time it's actually used.
T 1499785534 18<daemon87_18>	I'm not the developer of that plugin, only a simple user of the jboss tools :-)
T 1499785573 18<daemon87_18>	I know it's bad, or i'll create a pull-request and submit a patch for it
T 1499785951 18<daemon87_18>	thanks for the confirmation :-)

T 1501515641 22*	Channel 22#eclipse url: 24http://eclipse.org
T 1501515856 18<RangerRick18>	I tried the upgrade to oxygen and on every launch it asks me about updating epp.package.jee, org.eclipse.platform, and org.eclipse.rcp because of dependencies.
T 1501515879 18<RangerRick18>	If I hit "install" it launches as neon again.  If I hit "skip", it asks again on next startup.  What's the correct way to clean this up?
T 1501515896 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, how did you upgrade to oxygen ? with eclipse installer ?
T 1501515929 18<RangerRick18>	mvvvv: by adding the update site like https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_upgrade_Eclipse_IDE%3F suggests
T 1501515954 18<RangerRick18>	"Fron Neon to Oxygen and later, the usual upgrade process detailed below works."
T 1501515980 18<mvvvv18>	ok but did you used eclipse installer (oomph) to install neon ?
T 1501516013 18<RangerRick18>	I have no recollection. But I imagine I did.  I used whatever installer the eclipse download page pointed me at.
T 1501516049 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, ok so instead of "check update" use the entry menu "Perform setup task"
T 1501516054 18<RangerRick18>	(I realize there are many, but it was quite some time ago, I can't recall my specific steps from over a year ago.)
T 1501516103 18<RangerRick18>	OK, that shows me "Manual Tasks" and under that "P2 Director (Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers (Neon))"
T 1501516130 18<RangerRick18>	run that?
T 1501516154 18<RangerRick18>	or will that do the downgrade (since it says "Neon"")
T 1501516284 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, launch it "Finish" and you'll can open the detail window (the status icon turning on the bottom of the screen)
T 1501516367 18<RangerRick18>	looks like it installed some mac-specific tooling packages
T 1501516376 18<RangerRick18>	now when it launches it pops up the neon launch image again
T 1501516407 18<RangerRick18>	and about says it's Neon again
T 1501516417 18<mvvvv18>	launch "perform setup task" again
T 1501516499 18<RangerRick18>	mvvvv: it gives me the same choice, the Neon P2 Director
T 1501516507 18<RangerRick18>	hit it again?
T 1501516525 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, as often as you want
T 1501516534 18<RangerRick18>	haha alright
T 1501516541 18<RangerRick18>	just not clear that it's progress, that's all  :)
T 1501516605 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, what is the name of the directory where you installed this eclipse with oomph ?
T 1501516607 18<RangerRick18>	it says "no software updates are available" in the dialog
T 1501516625 18<RangerRick18>	it's in /Applications/eclipse
T 1501516639 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, so you're update but I'm not sure why it do not propose you to upgrade to oxygen
T 1501516685 18<RangerRick18>	if I go to "check for updates" it gives me all the individual oxygen updates again, but I suspect I'll be back in the same place
T 1501516741 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, yes because of oomph which manage now the pool of plugins
T 1501516771 18<RangerRick18>	I guess I can just do a clean install, but I've never quite grokked how to get all my plugins/config back to the way they are when doing so.
T 1501516843 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, that's something than oomph can do for you ... but first you have to configure the plugins/settins you want to keep between versions
T 1501516873 18<mvvvv18>	oh I see
T 1501516887 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, can you launch EclipseInst
T 1501516914 18<mvvvv18>	and update it (the turning icon)
T 1501516970 18<RangerRick18>	downloading now
T 1501516992 18<mvvvv18>	I have version 1.7.0 Build 3098 (for linux)
T 1501517138 18<RangerRick18>	after update, I get 1.7.0 Build 3059 (mac)
T 1501517174 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, ok so restart eclipse and try again
T 1501517203 18<RangerRick18>	oh, so "update" update my eclipse, not just the installer?
T 1501517227 18<RangerRick18>	or was I supposed to run "eclipseinst" from my existing eclipse install somehow?
T 1501517312 18<RangerRick18>	same choice in eclipse, P2 Director (Neon)
T 1501517405 18<mvvvv18>	perform setup task ... no change ?
T 1501517444 18<mvvvv18>	eclipseinst is only when you want to install one or many eclipse product and share the plugins
T 1501517495 18<RangerRick18>	correct, no change
T 1501517513 18<RangerRick18>	I just didn't know how eclipseinst affects an already running eclipse, since I'm just running it out of my downloads directory
T 1501517518 18<RangerRick18>	but I see it updates something in ~/.p2
T 1501517559 18<mvvvv18>	yes .p2 is where the plugins are with oomph (or EclipseInst) You should have something like that : https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1082235/
T 1501517959 18<RangerRick18>	so yeah, that thread sounds like my same issue, so it sounds like that is saying I should just run eclipse installer over my existing installation?
T 1501517989 18<RangerRick18>	because I still seem to be stuck in the same place
T 1501518025 18<mvvvv18>	RangerRick, yes something is missing, maybe the way you installed it first ...
T 1501518217 18<RangerRick18>	did that, now setup tasks gives me the oxygen version of P2 Director, so there's that at least
T 1501518232 18<RangerRick18>	didn't get the popup either
T 1501518289 18<RangerRick18>	Everything at least appears to be still working, and I didn't get that reminder on startup.  Thanks for the help.
T 1501518481 18<mvvvv18>	So now you know how to update : "Perform setup tasks"
T 1501518603 18<RangerRick18>	I guess that wiki page needs updating then  :)
T 1501518804 18<RangerRick18>	hrm, now things are in a bad state... trying to do a maven update on a project gives me java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException
T 1501518882 18<RangerRick18>	time to give up and start over, I guess
T 1501519033 18<RangerRick18>	fresh install thinks my workspace was written by an older version, so maybe things were still in a weird half-neon state or something
T 1501521322 18<Hobadee18>	I can't get GIT-LFS to work in Eclipse Oxygen on OSX.  It's installed and working fine in my $PATH but Eclipse complains that it can't find it.  Help!
T 1501522187 18<Maxel18>	I am trying to deploy code to a weblogic server from eclipse. I am getting an error saying java facet 1.8 is not supported by server. I went into the project settings and made sure to set it to 1.7 and clean/rebuild project and I am still getting that error when trying to deploy
T 1501522312 18<Maxel18>	where could eclipse be picking up a different java version than what I have set in the project facets window?
T 1501522994 18<humanBird18>	https://snag.gy/lYMnLz.jpg this color of text/background is horrible. whoever designed the dark theme for c++ messed up
T 1501523004 18<humanBird18>	apparently there's no way to change this in preferences either
T 1501524218 18<Hobadee18>	‎ I can't get GIT-LFS to work in Eclipse Oxygen on OSX.  It's installed and working fine in my $PATH but Eclipse complains that it can't find it.  Help!

T 1501617169 18<tachoknight18>	i can open another workspace where the window/tab isn't open on startup
T 1501617176 18<tachoknight18>	(this is latest oxygen, btw)
T 1501617193 18<tachoknight18>	is there anyway to fiddle with the workspace settings to 'close' the windows before starting eclipse?
T 1501617224 18<tachoknight18>	i've tried rapidly closing the windows on startup, but eclipse goes ahead and tries to initialize the dashboard anyway
T 1501617917 18<nitind18>	tachoknight: You can try removing the workspace's .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.e4.workbench/workbench.xmi file.
T 1501618088 18<tachoknight18>	nitind: that worked in that the other windows didn't open, but i see the dashboard is set to load every time

T 1501621130 18<tachoknight18>	well, so far all has been for naught; i even went so far as to copy the 'good' workspace's entire .metadata folder over to the bad one
T 1501621138 18<tachoknight18>	and it *still* tries to load the dashboard
T 1501621190 18<tachoknight18>	i moved the existing .metadata out of the way
T 1501621207 18<tachoknight18>	so there was literally no .metadata folder in the workspace directory
T 1501621215 18<tachoknight18>	sigh

T 1502437922 18<Gamoder_18>	Hi everyone, I am using eclipse neon.1, but it is now stuck when loading on org.eclipse.debug.ui. It started when I did ./eclipse -clean -refresh start, but when I then tried to start it again with ./eclipse, it again got stuck on org.eclipse.debug.ui. What could be the problem of that and how to resolve it?

T 1502665473 18<memunkey18>	quick question.  I have a project telling me that there is an invalid entry in the build path (a library that can't be found) but I can't remove the library reference using the GUI window because it is not listed.  I know the GUI references a config file in the project or workspace, but what file am I looking for?
T 1502665520 18<memunkey18>	i.e. "Library foo cannot be found" but I cannot remove or edit the reference to Library foo in the list of Libraries because it does not appear.
T 1502665581 18<memunkey18>	I know that list of library references is in a config file either at the project or workspace level.
T 1502665596 18<memunkey18>	just looking for a filename
T 1502669194 18<eclipse-mm18>	<nitind> If this is for a Java project, it's in the .classpath *if* it's not an entry coming from a classpath container, which could have a bug of its own.
