In fact there's a message saying "!ENTRY org.eclipse.equinox.app !MESSAGE Product org.eclipse.platform.ide could not be found". I doesn't include my plugins/features, and therefore every test fails as it doesn't find the menu entries/icons that I want to test. Do you
T 1474300615 18<chibby0ne18>	guys have any idea why this happens?
T 1474300616 18<mistria18>	Wallcraft: using Maven would be recommended
T 1474300658 18<mistria18>	Wallcraft: if you install JBoss Tools, you have some good help to get started with a Java EE project (and Maven), and good tools for the continuation of your project
T 1474300662 18<Wallcraft18>	i tried to use it, but i dont understand how to use, when i installed and convert my project into maven project i get only error
T 1474300717 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: is the org.eclipse.platform.ide product available in your target-platform Tycho is using?
T 1474300733 18<Wallcraft18>	Doesn't exist a sort of guide step by step for newbie that introduce to java EE developer and how to configure Eclipse too?
T 1474300761 18<mistria18>	Wallcraft: there are plenty of them, however, I'm not sure which one to recommend
T 1474300787 18<chibby0ne18>	So more specifically: in the <configuration> of tycho-surefire-plugin, I set the <product> to any of the commonly used products when launching but none of them are found. Funny thing is that all the test run perfectly when they are launched as junit test or swtbot test in run configuration menu.
T 1474300790 18<Wallcraft18>	okay thanks anyway!
T 1474300826 18<mistria18>	Wallcraft: this one is good http://developers.redhat.com/ticket-monster/ but I'm not sure it's for Java EE beginners
T 1474300863 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: that's because the necessary bundles are available in your "Run Configuration" of the IDE
T 1474300865 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, Yes, the target-definition file used in the target-platform-configuration plugin, basically contained everything from the normal update-sites (mars/neon-release, 4.5/4.6 release)
T 1474300893 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: ok...
T 1474300941 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: IIRC, Tycho doesn't automatically find which feature/bundle to add for a given productID, so you probably have to add extra-dependencies to the <configuration> of tycho-surefire-plugin to have the product included
T 1474300967 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, I'm not using target-platform anymore as I can always let tycho calculate the target-platform. Besides reading the surefire-plugin docs, it says that the OSGI runtime created doesn't contain all the plugins/features included in the target-definition
T 1474301046 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: yeah, that's fine, so I think you need to add explicitly a dependency to the bundle providing the product with https://eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-surefire/tycho-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#dependencies
T 1474301084 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, interesting.. I was doing that sort of extra-dependencies but not with the productID directly, I would just add all dependencies from the target-definition file (mainly org.eclipse.platform as eclipse-plugin)
T 1474301135 18<Wallcraft18>	mistria: thanks man
T 1474301176 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: you shouldn't use the productId as an artifactId, but add explicitly the dependency to the necessary bundle
T 1474301207 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: but anyway, you should also evaluate why your tests do require a product to work
T 1474301261 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: usually, you want you code to work in multiple products, so you'd like your plugin and test to run even without a product
T 1474301281 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, ok I'll try that again more carefully.
T 1474301301 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: most projects run without the product, using the regular workbench application.
T 1474301313 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, yeah but with/without a product it just launches a weird ide :(
T 1474301497 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, actually tbh there's a branding plugin (which I'm not including in the build atm because it doesn't work) but what would be the difference in the approach if I wanted to use swtbot for rcp products? wouldn't that require the product? Also what is the testRuntime=p2Installed. I've tried this ( by using the maven-director and materializing-product goal), and pointing to the work directory to that installation but it also doesn't

T 1474302353 18<mistria18>	Wallcraft: IIRC, if you configure a server in the "Servers" view and associate it with the project, the classpath should be augmented to include the JEE jars
T 1474302394 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: did you look at the log in details, it doesn't tell anything more about not finding product?

T 1474481570 18<Newyorkadam18>	what does it mean to "switch stacks" using the eclipse debugger?
T 1474481700 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Newyorkadam: Well, I would guess that would refer to the fact that in a multi-threaded application, you could potentially be at multiple breakpoints at the same time, so you could inspect the stack at each breakpoint separately.
T 1474481714 18<Newyorkadam18>	davidmichaelkarr: how would you do that?
T 1474481750 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Newyorkadam: You just click on the stack entry in the debugger frame.  You'd have to scroll up or down to find the thread that has hit a breakpoint.

However, you might be able to get some mileage out of installing "jd-eclipse", a decompiler plugin for Eclipse.

T 1475179111 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	nitind: Well, no, that's not it, but I did just figure it out. That only gives the tooltip window keyboard focus. I found the hovers prefs page which shows the modifiers.  I thought it was something like that, but I didn't know which ones did what.  I found what modifier javadoc is set to, and I see that that works.

T 1475179467 18<nitind18>	And what you can learn by trying to figure out how to answer the questions you don't already know how to answer.
T 1475180102 18<Infested118>	hello, i need to do a project in prolog, and i would like to do the gui in java. does eclipse support prolog in java or anything of the sort?
T 1475180309 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Infested1: you might just build a plain java gui and execute your prolog interpreter from it.
T 1475180398 18<Infested118>	well its a game, all the rules and checking moves are valid and stuff like that should happen in prolog. the gui part is just for ease of use and game management (like whos turn it is and calling the right methods)
T 1475180679 18<Infested118>	davidmichaelkarr: forgot to notify
T 1475180789 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Infested1: doesn't change my answer.
T 1475180838 18<Maxel18>	not sure if this is an eclipse question: I have eclipse with weblogic server. I am trying to set up weblogic and when I add my username/password credentials and hit test, it says successful, but then as soon as I hit ok, the message next to the server says user authentication failed
T 1475180939 18<Infested118>	ok then i dont understand your answer. how do i execute my prolog interpreter from it, and get an answer back (and maybe send it info), and how do i keep the prolog's knowledge of the game alive?
T 1475184528 18<nitind18>	Maxel: What does "set up weblogic" mean, and is that related to Eclipse somehow?
T 1475184745 18<davidmichaelkarr18>	Infested1: you can run other executables from java. You can pass it input and read output.
T 1475235479 18<chibby0ne18>	Hey guys is anyone familiar with code coverage using Jacoco? My problem is that the report lists the class analyzed as test class and not the Class under Test.
T 1475235761 18<chibby0ne18>	is there any eclipse project that uses jacoco?
T 1475236044 18<mvvvv18>	chibby0ne, computer says yes !
T 1475236331 18<chibby0ne18>	oh forgot to mention: this is related to using Jacoco in maven builds. Not the Eclipse Plugin Eclmma
T 1475236381 18<mvvvv18>	computer says yes
T 1475236505 18<chibby0ne18>	mvvvv, ?
T 1475236544 18<mvvvv18>	google : eclipse maven jacoco  --> http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html
T 1475237177 18<chibby0ne18>	mvvvv, funny. I did that... it doesn't explain how to use jacoco to create coverage reports of eclipse-plugin from eclipse-test-plugin does it?
T 1475237343 18<mvvvv18>	not funny I didn't understood your question. so you want to test your eclipse-plugin using jacoco
T 1475237464 18<chibby0ne18>	mvvvv, computer says yes !
T 1475237575 18<chibby0ne18>	mvvvv, just in case: yes that's what I meant: produce test coverage of an eclipse-plugin
T 1475237929 18<mvvvv18>	So you can do that from eclipse launch configurations : http://www.eclemma.org/userdoc/launching.html and you want to do that from maven
T 1475238143 18<chibby0ne18>	mvvvv, yeah exactly
T 1475238274 18<mvvvv18>	something like that : https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/977961/
T 1475238760 18<chibby0ne18>	mvvvv, not really. I'm not using RCPTT. I'm doing unit tests at the moment, but I also have SWTBot tests that I would like to add to the coverage report.
T 1475238860 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: Eclipse Platform and SWTBot do have code coverage produced by Jacoco and reported to Sonar
T 1475238922 18<mvvvv18>	mistria, with RCPTT ...
T 1475238925 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: just noticed that SWTBot seems to have the same problem as you have
T 1475238936 18<mistria18>	mvvvv: no
T 1475239020 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: see https://dev.eclipse.org/sonar/drilldown/measures/33441?metric=coverage for example
T 1475239066 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: however, Sonar does all the magic, all we did is provide it a nice jacoco.exec to report
T 1475239230 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: and here is the job configuration: https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.resources-SonarQube/
T 1475239605 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, ok this is definitively helpful! Thanks mistria!!
T 1475239637 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, what I did notice is that they're not using jacoco report goal... they just use "prepare-agent"
T 1475239661 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: yes, Sonar does the report
T 1475239696 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: it's easier to install Sonar  and let it work than to try to automate report creation via Maven
T 1475239712 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: moreover, it looks nicer and is easier to browse
T 1475239753 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: if you interest in code coverage and other quality indicators, using SonarQube is worth it
T 1475239762 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: especially since it's free ;)
T 1475239798 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, it does look much prettier, but I was hoping at some point to show the code coverage stats from jenkins itself (using the jacoco jenkins plugin)
T 1475239826 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: ok, I never tried it
T 1475239893 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, just checked; there's also a sonarcube jenkins plugin...
T 1475240076 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: yes, Platform uses it. Hudson/Jenkins runs build (which generate the jacoco.exec) and then invoke the SonarQube plugin (which triggers analysis and report)
T 1475240094 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: it's a post-build step like JUnit reports
T 1475240257 18<mizhka18>	hi! it will be nice to see new OS support (*bsd), but what should be done for it? actually port of Eclipse exists for a long time, actual version is 4.6.0. there is also bugzilla ticket...
T 1475240546 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, I see! interesting approach indeed!
T 1475241737 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, checking the poms from the build.. I don't see any configuration of jacoco plugin
T 1475241864 18<mistria18>	chibby0ne: it's http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator.git/tree/eclipse-platform-parent/pom.xml#n1013 . The jacoco.destFile property is set to an absolutePath in the hudson job and passed to the SonarQube Hudson plugoin
T 1475241981 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, oh ok I just went and cloned eclipse.platform.resources because that's what the build showed, but yeah this is the parent of all the platform subprojects right?
T 1475243708 18<chibby0ne18>	mistria, mmm I just noticed I still have the same problem of having the stats for the test itself and not the plugin...
T 1475247304 18<Gamoder_18>	Hi everyone, how can I ensure some classes are available in the runtime for some plugin project? I always get some NoClassDefFoundError for classes which I think should be on the classpath
