T 1520615605 18<mbooth18>	donald: System libraries are usually installed into /usr/lib or /usr/lib64
T 1520615662 18<enleeten18>	@donald the packages in debian tend to be named like libfoo
T 1520615668 18<enleeten18>	for various library
T 1520615684 18<enleeten18>	so you just need to install that and possibly the -dev variant, which will include headers for compiling against
T 1520615707 18<enleeten18>	so like apt-get install libfoo and apt-get install libfoo-dev

T 1520616181 18<enleeten18>	looks like beast and beast2 are in apt

T 1520616999 18<enleeten18>	looking at it, it's header only, so you really just need to check it out from github and make sure it's on your include path
T 1520617018 18<enleeten18>	so its not like you need to build beast into a lib and link that
T 1520617070 18<donald18>	I can not download with apt install???
T 1520617085 18<enleeten18>	I don't see it in apt, so perhaps not
T 1520617100 18<donald18>	ok
T 1520617103 18<enleeten18>	just clone the latest release version from github and put it on your project's include path
T 1520617121 18<enleeten18>	if you have a compatible version of boost installed locally (and any other deps), should just work :)

T 1520617453 18<donald18>	if you have a compatible version of boost installed locally (and any other deps), should just work :) => Ihave already installed boost via apt. are you sure I need to clone  beast?

T 1520617853 18<enleeten18>	like I said, you don't need to link beast, it's a header only library
T 1520617862 18<donald18>	then I download the repo
T 1520617864 18<enleeten18>	you just need it on your include paths when you compile
T 1520617869 18<donald18>	ah ok
T 1520617876 18<enleeten18>	you will need to link against boost libs though
T 1520617919 18<enleeten18>	but those are on your system and presumably you linker path, so you should just need to add the boost lib name(s) when linking
T 1520617944 18<donald18>	let me try that
T 1520618076 18<donald18>	enleeten then if I put everything in /usr/include/ all is rigth?

T 1520618138 18<enleeten18>	you could install it globally, /usr/include is usually managed by the system though, /usr/local/include would be better for manual global install
T 1520618151 18<enleeten18>	but in your project is fine also, if you don't intend on using the library anywhere else
T 1520618230 18<donald18>	cool
T 1520618777 18<donald18>	enleeten then I do #include <beast-develop/include/boost/beast>?

T 1520619065 18<enleeten18>	once you have the library on your include path (of your compiler command, make file, cmake, whatever)
T 1520619078 18<enleeten18>	you don't need to give an absolute path in your code
T 1520619088 18<enleeten18>	you'd have just boost/beast or something similar
T 1520619109 18<donald18>	then where do I put beast-develop?
T 1520619184 18<enleeten18>	it doesn't matter, so long as that path is on your includes when running the compiler
T 1520619269 18<donald18>	then how to put my files in include? I do not see the include folder in /worskspace
T 1520619481 18<donald18>	enleeten becauser  I can not see the folder
T 1520619496 18<enleeten18>	you may want to ask in one of the C++ channels
T 1520619512 18<donald18>	no
T 1520619543 18<donald18>	I just do no find the way to do it in eclipse nor the physical folder in my computer
T 1520619780 18<enleeten18>	you can typically specify an include path with the compiler, like c++ -I/usr/local/include/beast
T 1520619799 18<enleeten18>	so your code will only have something like #include <boost/beast>
T 1520619813 18<enleeten18>	as the location of the beast library is specified by the compiler flag
T 1520619814 18<donald18>	c++ not g++ ?
T 1520619837 18<enleeten18>	could be either, depending on which compiler family you're using and how they're symlinked

T 1521483950 18<JeffH18>	I’ve set some file specific include paths. Now I want to get rid of them and revert to defaults. When I try that I get a java exception. Anyone seen that before?  Is there a workaround?
T 1521484019 18<nitind18>	What are file specific include paths? What's the exception trace?
T 1521484102 18<JeffH18>	Into some other workspace directories. Unfortunately I can’t paste the exception trace.
T 1521484248 18<JeffH18>	Java.lang.NullPointerException is the error.

T 1521770428 18<neteffect18>	hmmm I don't understand what the problem is.  Switcing to 9 didn't help.  Is this some kind of build path problem?

T 1521771596 18<nitind18>	I'm surprised it would affect being able to code against it, though.
T 1521771632 18<neteffect18>	i thought it had something to do with building, but i'm new
T 1521771919 18<nitind18>	Eclipse has its own compiler, but it does still need the class libraries themselves from a runtime to compile against, the JavaDoc executable from the JDK if you want to export JavaDoc, etc.
T 1521771951 18<neteffect18>	hmmm still says it with the official 9
