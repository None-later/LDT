T 1491508125 18<mcatanzaro18>	That one I can answer: the stuff fixed in 2.16.1 doesn't have CVEs yet
T 1491508164 18<leio18>	so 2.14 series backports were delayed
T 1491508240 18<leio18>	but yeah, I wonder if I should be looking at 2.14.6 or not with some open CVEs in the 2.14 series...
T 1491508271 18<mcatanzaro18>	My recommendation is to always use the latest stable version, currently 2.16.1.
T 1491508304 18<clopez18>	versions affected: before 2.16.0 -> means 2.16.0 is safe and any version after it

T 1491508400 18<leio18>	clopez: the question is - how comes 2.14.6 only fixes a big set of the CVE's in that WSA, not all
T 1491508427 18<clopez18>	leio: because some CVEs were inpractical to port
T 1491508438 18<mcatanzaro18>	2.16.0 works fine with Ephy 3.22 and Evolution 3.22 or there would be tons of complaints from Fedora :)
T 1491508445 18<clopez18>	we did the 2.14.6 for debian specifically because they refuse to update to 2.16.0 on stretch

T 1491508485 18<leio18>	ok, I can look into 2.16.1 and get it stabled with the excuse of security

T 1491508518 18<mcatanzaro18>	BTW this entire conversation validates my argument that releasing 2.14.6 was a bad idea... Debian could just as easily have backported those patches without us putting a stamp of approval on it.
T 1491508541 18<clopez18>	yeah.. i also clarified on the list this
T 1491508544 18<leio18>	I don't know anything about debian.

T 1491508569 18<mcatanzaro18>	Fixing the password manager to not give out all your passwords was a "surprise"...?
T 1491508570 18<clopez18>	this 2.14.6 was a exception to the rule, and only because of debian
T 1491508605 18<leio18>	the surprise was the claim by my team members that was still stuck at 3.20 for.. reasons.. claiming that the webkit upgrade broke epiphany
T 1491508620 18<leio18>	so I mean the interlock
T 1491508626 18<mcatanzaro18>	If so, nobody told me
T 1491508659 18<leio18>	he might have very well been wrong, the point was not having surprises of a webkitgtk upgrade breaking an earlier minor version of epiphany or something else
T 1491508663 18<leio18>	if that wasn't actually the case, good
T 1491508665 18<mcatanzaro18>	We have Ephy 3.20 + WebKitGTK+ 2.16 in Fedora 24 right now with no complaints
T 1491508689 18<clopez18>	ubuntu is also upgrading to the last stable version on the LTS version of their distro
T 1491508692 18<mcatanzaro18>	Actually I think the 2.14 upgrade would have broken Ephy 3.20 if you didn't take the corresponding Ephy release
T 1491508700 18<leio18>	regarding 6 months, for us 7 months can be good, IFF such incompatibilies might be a concern; otherwise doesn't matter if we get some communication going.
T 1491508714 18<leio18>	mcatanzaro: yes, that was the issue.
T 1491508715 18<mcatanzaro18>	Because Ephy used unstable DOM API that changed in 2.14
T 1491508730 18<mcatanzaro18>	All that API was removed in 2.16 so it shouldn't be a problem anymore
T 1491508749 18<mcatanzaro18>	It was really dumb to have Ephy depend on that, since it can go away at any time
T 1491508762 18<leio18>	I got back into gentoo maintenance things, caugt us up to 3.22 finally, so at least 3.20 isn't a thing anymore

T 1491509473 18<leio18>	anyways, we are happy about any and all GNOME cycle related point releases up to 1-2 months of the next cycle having been around
T 1491509497 18<leio18>	if there are incompatibilties for a security fix then that's something to know about beforehand; if not, then for security we can go earlier
T 1491509560 18<leio18>	otherwise the entirety of what is in a GNOME cycle won't be in "stable" before at least 30 days have passed after it being in "testing", which can't be before a month it has been released upstream, but probably longer due to work to be done to get it to testing
T 1491509612 18<mcatanzaro18>	The point of removing the unstable DOM API was to avoid surprises like that occurring again... sorry that it happened in the first place.
T 1491509618 18<leio18>	hence sometimes supporting an earlier cycle release up to ~7 months instead of ~6 months can be nice, as for clear important bug or security fixes I'm happy to do it earlier than 30 days of appearance

T 1491509724 18<mcatanzaro18>	Well, *almost* any changes are bugs... if something is removed from the DOM spec then the corresponding functions may stop working. I think zero apps have ever been broken by such a change, though. :)

T 1492082593 18<ebassi18>	Ideally, the documentation should tell you which domains it will return, so you can use matches() accordingly

T 1492082979 18<quinq18>	Shouldn't those be gathered under WEBKIT_NETWORK_ERROR_FAILED?
T 1492083129 18<ebassi18>	It depends; it would imply catching all errors inside webkit at all times, then checking if there's an existing domain/code that fits, and re-packaging the error
T 1492083160 18<ebassi18>	It's like catching all exceptions and re-throwing them
T 1492083251 18<ebassi18>	In general, G* libraries prefer propagating errors and leaving to callers to do matching; of course, the documentation needs to be kept up to date :-)

T 1492619229 18<mcrha18>	okay, so it requires "enable-javascript", which is not an option for evolution when showing random mail content
T 1492619330 18<annulen18>	hmm, maybe it's because new media controls require javascript
T 1492619406 18<mcrha18>	maybe. I think it wasn't the case in the past, but my past dates back to something like WebKitGTK+ with WebKit1, not WebKit2.
T 1492619417 18<annulen18>	indeed, disabling js breaks controls, so only autoplay elements can work

T 1492619479 18<mcrha18>	ah, okay, then I'll disable inline playing of audio files, to not confuse users of evolution
T 1492619538 18<mcrha18>	there is some more catch-up on the evolution side, as I had been able to reproduce this out of it, with my old test app which uses WebKit2 by changing the settings

T 1493209915 18<tpopela18>	rdlp, I see that it's probably a WebKit1 based so anything < 2.4.11

T 1493211492 18<tpopela18>	rdlp, if you insist on using WebKit1 then you should use 2.4.11, but you should move to WebKit2 based WebKitGTK+ and that's 2.16.x

T 1493211848 18<tpopela18>	rdlp, yeah definitely try 2.4.11 or move to 2.16.x.. There you can use https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitWebView.html#webkit-web-view-run-javascript to manipulate with DOM.. Or you can create an WebKitWebExtension - https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitWebExtension.html if you will need advanced things..
