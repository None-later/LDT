T 1510021357 18<convert18>	nevermind the opengl works with the minibrowser
T 1510021367 18<convert18>	its the stupid surf browser that fails
T 1510021452 18<convert18>	except there is no dri... and its slow
T 1510028821 18<convert18>	i need a clue. If I run MiniBrowser it links to /usr/lib/dri* from Mesa and gl "works" but is slow because there is no dri2.
T 1510028849 18<convert18>	if i use a webkit linked browser it links to /usr/X11R6/lib/fglrx.dri and gl webgl just doesnt work
T 1510028858 18<convert18>	what determines this
T 1510029737 18<ebassi18>	'fb setup not supported' means that the version of OpenGL you have is terrifying old; pre-2.1, even.
T 1510029754 18<ebassi18>	You don't have access to framebuffer objects
T 1510029778 18<convert18>	well it is pretty old...
T 1510029782 18<ebassi18>	Nothing using GL will likely work, except very simple stuff from the late '90s/early '00s
T 1510029798 18<ebassi18>	Let alone webgl
T 1510029820 18<convert18>	webgl in ff54 works fine

T 1510029880 18<ebassi18>	Does "works fine" mean "really slow, and maybe emulated on the CPU"?
T 1510029913 18<convert18>	no, it uses the fglrx-dri, that driver is from 2011, and later fglrx releases stopped supporting the video card
T 1510029949 18<convert18>	thats what i undrstand from proc/*/maps
T 1510030012 18<convert18>	it probably doesnt use the same framebuffer api as gtk?
T 1510030067 18<convert18>	fwiw i just recompiled latest mesa epoxy and 3.22 gtk for this
T 1510030139 18<ebassi18>	convert: The fact that it loaded the driver, and the fact that is uses it, are two very different things
T 1510030184 18<convert18>	i still dont understand why my browser loads fglrx-dri (and fails), while the MiniBrowser uses mesa (doesnt load fglrx-dri) and succeeds though dead-slow with emulation
T 1510030217 18<ebassi18>	The framebuffer API in OpenGL is one, so if GTK is trying to use it and fails, it usually means that the API is not supported at all
T 1510030301 18<convert18>	ff54 is pretty fast, i dont know how to benchmark it to say it is not emulation, speed is comparable to fgl_glxgears on the small example program i wrote
T 1510030418 18<convert18>	comparing ff54 to the minibrowser, the difference is clear
T 1510030875 18<convert18>	this dri usiness is so opaque to me.

T 1512477726 18<DimStar18>	if nothing is started yet, I might have a look at what all is needed to migrate
T 1512477950 18<annulen18>	DimStar: you need python2 to *build* webkitgtk
T 1512477963 18<annulen18>	it has nothing to do with python version where you will use it

T 1512478107 18<convert18>	does this build problem seem familiar:  cannot derive from 'final' base 'WebCore::InspectorNetworkAgent' in derived type 'WebCore::PageNetworkAgent'
T 1512478138 18<annulen18>	DimStar: MS DOS cannot run on lots of modern hardware, only in VM, while py2 runs on modern OSes without troubles and is often avaiable by default
T 1512478177 18<annulen18>	moreover, MS DOS is EOL  for decades while py2 is far from that
T 1512478189 18<DimStar18>	annulen: ok, bad example.. but modern enterprise OSes start to put py2 into the legacy module set, making it 'not available by default'
T 1512478222 18<DimStar18>	I doubt wk should wait to even 'support' building with py3 until py2 is eol and not installable anymore
T 1512478274 18<Ms2ger18>	convert, did you try to derive from a final class?

T 1512478567 18<DimStar18>	and from what I hear, enterprises OS distros want to put py2 in a stack that is not maintained 'for the entire life cycle of the base os' (the prediction being that py2 won't be around for another 7 years)

T 1512479086 18<convert18>	i guess the final means  InspectorNetworkAgent is final
T 1512479117 18<convert18>	and the compiler says:  cannot derive from 'final' base 'WebCore::InspectorNetworkAgent' in derived type 'WebCore::PageNetworkAgent'
T 1512479142 18<convert18>	I guess InspectorNetworkAgent should not be marked final after all
T 1512479213 18<annulen18>	afaik current policy is that's fine to add final to any (non-public) class which nothing derives from, it doesn't mean that it's final "by design"
T 1512479341 18<convert18>	it takes 90 seconds for me to compile UnifiedSource258.cpp before I get an error
T 1512479366 18<convert18>	so maybe PageNetworkAgent should not be marked final..
T 1512479454 18<convert18>	i imagine this is not much different from programming mainframes in the 60s waiting for your jobs to print
T 1512479544 18<annulen18>	since r224788 InspectorNetworkAgent is not final
T 1512479557 18<annulen18>	(and if PageNetworkAgent is final or not is irrelevant)

T 1512637001 18<annulen18>	fwiw in QtWebKit we use internal IPC to send messages to WebProcess
T 1512637010 18<convert18>	ideally i would try to reuse the mechanism already here
T 1512637041 18<annulen18>	WebProcess has handleInjectedBundleMessage() API

T 1512637068 18<annulen18>	that's all I know about that
T 1512637082 18<convert18>	i tried reading the code in epiphany which uses gdbus from gio, and wyeb which uses a unix pipe (again through gio). wyeb registers a handler which would work through the glib mainloop but i dont see where or how that can be started
T 1512637116 18<annulen18>	there must be example somewhere
T 1512637141 18<convert18>	even if you use dbus, it has to hook into the webprocess mainloop, or start a new thread to handle the messages and run a new loop there

T 1512637404 18<convert18>	thats good to see, but i meant the html widget for qt 5.9.x (i installed the base system here recently) - the html widget was a 1.3G or 2G source tree
T 1512638385 18<convert18>	so the otter-browser (i havent seen it, only heard the name) uses qtwebkit and not the qtwebengine?

T 1512753873 18<jjongsma18>	FYI: in b316aabf, I think I would move the "ring_remove(...)" from video_stream_unref() to video_stream_free().
