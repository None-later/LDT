T 1472571821 18<strykerawb18>	i mean i got it to work in principle but it still doesn't work ;) 
T 1472571846 18<strykerawb18>	the problem is that most vagrant commands i issue this way end up saying that vagrant is trying to talk to the process as if it was a TTY terminal
T 1472571863 18<rgrunber18>	strykerawb: i had some suggestions a little while ago for that.
T 1472571879 18<rgrunber18>	strykerawb: i didn't have a chance to try them out..
T 1472571899 18<rgrunber18>	(see the jira)
T 1472571939 18<strykerawb18>	rgrunber,   yeah...  we're only using machine-readbale during vagrant service-manager env  calls
T 1472571943 18<strykerawb18>	so thats not relevant 
T 1472571959 18<strykerawb18>	and as for wrapping in a call to bash,  um... this stuff needs to work in windows too
T 1472571965 18<strykerawb18>	so we can't really wrap it in bash 
T 1472572054 18<strykerawb18>	rgrunber,   is there an official vagrant syntax to avoid the vagrant commands trying to treat the caller as a tty terminal?
T 1472572056 18<rgrunber18>	can you wrap it in bash for just linux ?.. i could have sworn the vagrant code said something like "if not on windows and stdin.tty is false then error"
T 1472572058 18<strykerawb18>	or is it on a per-command basis? 
T 1472572282 18<rgrunber18>	strykerawb: i don't think its possible. vagrant expects the stdin stream to be from a tty when not on windows.
T 1472572310 18<strykerawb18>	that seems absolutely horrible as an assumption
T 1472572315 18<rgrunber18>	strykerawb: hey so.. can you just try running this on windows and see if it works.. i mean.. it seems like it should.
T 1472572337 18<rgrunber18>	'# We can't ask questions when the output isn't a TTY.'
T 1472572347 18<strykerawb18>	where's that from? link?
T 1472572355 18<rgrunber18>	ah one sec.. vagrant sources
T 1472572388 18<rgrunber18>	https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/lib/vagrant/ui.rb#L161
T 1472572488 18<strykerawb18>	see the thing that gets me is the wording in the error itself
T 1472572498 18<strykerawb18>	Most actions in Vagrant that require a TTY have configuration
T 1472572498 18<strykerawb18>	switches to disable this requirement. Please do that or run Vagrant
T 1472572498 18<strykerawb18>	with TTY.
T 1472572523 18<strykerawb18>	so this begs the question:  is there a way to ask questions without tty and its up to the plugins (ie vagrant service-manager) to implement properly a flag?
T 1472572535 18<strykerawb18>	sorry i mean vagrant registration
T 1472572647 18<strykerawb18>	rgrunber, the reason i ask this question is because,  running a simple java program that reads standard in / standard out doesn't require a TTY terminal
T 1472572647 18<rgrunber18>	do they mean that there are configuration switches to answer the 'question' .. rather than.. there's a way to get the questions without TTY requirement.. i mean this is supposed to be a string message geared towards a user.. not a developer who cares about the internals.
T 1472572663 18<strykerawb18>	so i can't see any technical reason they can't ask questions without a tty
T 1472572665 18<strykerawb18>	it makes no sense
T 1472572797 18<strykerawb18>	rgrunber,  who do you think we can ask? =P 
T 1472572801 18<rgrunber18>	maybe they send terminal codes through.. and try to confirm the stream is attached to something that could read them.. seems like it's not their problem but meh.
T 1472572855 18<rgrunber18>	you might get a better answer on devtools (hopefully).. if not i'd love to play around with it because i think this is the right approach.. also you're so close.
T 1472572857 18<strykerawb18>	now again, if i simply open a terminal view, connect to the local host, and send to the terminal's stream "vagrant up" it will work
T 1472572868 18<strykerawb18>	bc then it IS a tty terminal
T 1472572877 18<strykerawb18>	but then i can't get a reference to the IProcess
T 1472572895 18<strykerawb18>	or even a java.lang.Process
T 1472572902 18<rgrunber18>	a stream from bash -i should also be a tty though.. if i could get that to work.
T 1472572949 18<strykerawb18>	rgrunber,  do you have time to do some pair coding today or tomorrow? not sure on your current work load
T 1472572964 18<strykerawb18>	i suspect the current impl "just works" in windows already
T 1472572969 18<strykerawb18>	when run as admin
T 1472572981 18<strykerawb18>	but to get it to work on both windows and linux is the hard part
T 1472573081 18<rgrunber18>	strykerawb: so weird for me to be like 'yay it works on windows, that's .. actually the really important case' :(
T 1472573128 18<rgrunber18>	strykerawb: i'll be in tomorrow. tbh i just wanna tinker with wrapping the call in bash.. that should let isatty() pass.

T 1474653231 18<Highlander18>	they know you will get at least 15% of a benefit from your deducated amount, so they will likely tax you on at least that amount each cheque I would think

T 1474653418 18<fnasser18>	after tax
T 1474653421 18<Highlander18>	depends on whetehr they categorize it as a stock benefit. if they do, then you'll pay even less tax.. but IM not convinced.  gains on RSus are taxed at your salary rate
T 1474653452 18<Highlander18>	I dont think capital gains will come into it until after you own the stock
T 1474653473 18<fnasser18>	Highlander, but whatever I make when I sell the RSU stock I've got is taxed as capita gain (or los)

T 1474653491 18<Highlander18>	yes. once you own it, its all capital gain/loss
T 1474653517 18<fnasser18>	Highlander, Ah, that is true, so the percentage above 15% is still before I got the stocks
T 1474653524 18<fnasser18>	in the case of the ESPP
T 1474653525 18<Highlander18>	but they tax you on it before they issue it to you.. so its at salary rate.  I would expect the ESPP to be similar.. but we can hope not. 
T 1474653563 18<fnasser18>	Nah, fat chance, you are right, we are buying it below marked price and that can be more than 15% if the stocks went up
T 1474653574 18<fnasser18>	But... maybe there is a bit of law specifically for that case
T 1474653584 18<fnasser18>	To incentive investing or something
T 1474653598 18<Highlander18>	I suspect the tax law works such that if they did it any other way, the company is on the hook for the difference .  THis way, it all on us
T 1474653633 18<fnasser18>	Highlander, Anyway, bottom line is that it is still a savings account on steroids given the currently interest paied around, right?
T 1474653672 18<Highlander18>	indeed. Its basically some free money
T 1474653683 18<fnasser18>	Highlander, Got it!
T 1474653686 18<Highlander18>	unles you are incredibly unlucky and the stock price drops by more than 15% before you can sell it :-)
T 1474653695 18<Highlander18>	so there is still a TINY risk.
