T 1472048634 18<akurtakov18>	with that said, I don't know what exactly do you want to contribute in eclipse land
T 1472048665 18<mistria18>	akurtakov: as soon as the lsp4j project is provisioned at Eclipse.org and Platform intergrated the Generic editor, the language server support for Generic Editor can be moved to DLTK then
T 1472048683 18<mistria18>	akurtakov: it's https://github.com/eclipselabs/eclipse-language-service
T 1472048704 18<akurtakov18>	mistria: so basically that is hooking lsp4j in the generic editor?
T 1472048709 18<scela18>	akurtakov: yes
T 1472048719 18<akurtakov18>	sounds good
T 1472048751 18<scela18>	akurtakov: generic editor can have any source, language servers are one. the code to bind to language servers will have to go to somewhere.
T 1472048774 18<scela18>	by 'source' i mean source of information on coloring autocomplete etc. :)
T 1472049330 18<maxandersen18>	mistria why would we not want the generic editor in eclipse platform ? 
T 1472049365 18<akurtakov18>	maxandersen: not the generic editor but it's hook to language server
T 1472049377 18<mistria18>	maxandersen: you misread some comments: generic editor in Platform, lsp-based extensions into DLTK
T 1472049429 18<maxandersen18>	@akurtakov okey - as long as it does not require installing all the existing stuff in DLTK that can work. 
T 1472049441 18<maxandersen18>	but where would i.e. json language server live ? 
T 1472049449 18<maxandersen18>	language server based editor i mean.
T 1472049455 18<maxandersen18>	would that be in WTP or DLTK ? 
T 1472049460 18<akurtakov18>	that's entirely different question 
T 1472049493 18<maxandersen18>	akurtakov okey, then I don't grok what is suggested to be in dltk ? 
T 1472049495 18<mistria18>	maxandersen: specific "connections" or server would most likely go into WTP
T 1472049520 18<mistria18>	maxandersen: the language server client for Eclipse Platform generic editor
T 1472049528 18<mistria18>	maxandersen: which isn't language-specific
T 1472049531 18<maxandersen18>	mistria okey, so WTP would need to depend on DLTK to get what it needs, mnot just platform ? 
T 1472049550 18<mistria18>	maxandersen: if they want to pick the language server support, yes
T 1472049566 18<mistria18>	maxandersen: there is IMO no way to have this language server support in Platform
T 1472049567 18<maxandersen18>	ookey, so back to again - why not have that in the platform.
T 1472049577 18<mistria18>	maxandersne: but maybe akurtakov have a different opinion
T 1472049581 18<maxandersen18>	just like syntax highlghting is in the platform.

T 1472049612 18<mistria18>	maxandersen: those don't depend on an external protocol or api, that's I believe what can make a difference
T 1472049620 18<maxandersen18>	I honestly think if we put LPS stuff in higher level projects we'll not get the benefirts from it.
T 1472049621 18<akurtakov18>	we wanted to create ide-commons for that sole purpose to hoste launchbar, remote, templates and eventually this one
T 1472049627 18<mistria18>	maxandersen: but if platform is fine with keeping the LSP client, why not
T 1472049627 18<akurtakov18>	but never got to it
T 1472049660 18<maxandersen18>	akurtakov yes, which is why I was hopening putting it in platform would hav emore success ;)
T 1472049661 18<akurtakov18>	I'm not convinced about lsp in platfrom yet

T 1472049701 18<akurtakov18>	is it 100% one company controlled?
T 1472049713 18<akurtakov18>	as long as that's true I don't see it coming into platform
T 1472049718 18<mistria18>	maxandersen akurtakov: I believe the API and release rules in Platform wouldn't fit for such a technology that's prone to evolve a lot
T 1472049750 18<akurtakov18>	at least that's the PMC opinion from previous meetings
T 1472049757 18<mistria18>	akurtakov maxandersen: could be in the e4.ui repository, that's where I've put all my mess lately ;)
T 1472049842 18<scela18>	mistria: i'd rather not have it into an incubation-level project
T 1472049850 18<akurtakov18>	being in e4.ui has the nasty incubation thing
T 1472049881 18<akurtakov18>	which would prevent using it in e.g. linuxtools for the dockereditor or in dltk ruby and etc.
T 1472049946 18<mistria18>	maybe just lsp4j would be fine
T 1472049961 18<mistria18>	they'd have their plain API in one repo, and another repo for the Eclipse integration
T 1472049982 18<mistria18>	after all, it's where this would make the more sense
T 1472050001 18<scela18>	mistria: which repos do you mean in either case?
T 1472050019 18<mistria18>	lsp4j.core, lsp4j.eclipse.ui

T 1472050081 18<maxandersen18>	mistria the platform needs to find a way to ship things that moves faster into the release train ;)
T 1472050131 18<akurtakov18>	maxandersen: that has been also discussed multiple times - there is no issue with that other than no one to act on real releng tasks to make this happen
T 1472050177 18<akurtakov18>	so we have the agreement this has to happen and all available resources at 150% at other tasks
T 1472050217 18<akurtakov18>	so nothing happens
T 1472050239 18<akurtakov18>	as it's more important keeping what we have now not breaking
T 1472050341 18<akurtakov18>	maxandersen: I'm with you on that but if we want it to happen we have huge backlog to fight first
T 1472050391 18<akurtakov18>	e.g. even for Neon we lifted the limit to what can be backported so Neon.1...n will be more important releases
T 1472050406 18<akurtakov18>	but we face the issue of not having who to do the actual backports
T 1472050425 18<maxandersen18>	agreed - if putting in platform is impossible then need to find another place to host it - DLTK for me just seem so foreign and seperated ;)
T 1472050440 18<maxandersen18>	but if it could be done in DLTK similar to how docker tools was done in linux tools then great.
T 1472050462 18<maxandersen18>	ie. docker was just put in linux tools so it could be released, but no actual connection to linux tools.
T 1472050483 18<akurtakov18>	maxandersen: I really don't have preference over lsp4j and dltk 
T 1472050505 18<akurtakov18>	if lsp4j folks are not fine with having it we should be able to sneak it into dltk so we can release it
T 1472050537 18<maxandersen18>	you guys are aware gorkem is being asked by IBM to contribute the jdt-server implementation to JDT ...that will not use lsp4j anytime soon. 
T 1472050540 18<akurtakov18>	maxandersen: it's not that it's important to put into platform it just requires more effort 
T 1472050589 18<maxandersen18>	and he is working on a propsoal for that.
T 1472050607 18<akurtakov18>	my impression was that lsp4j was more for client side implementation
T 1472050642 18<akurtakov18>	when for server side you can implement protocol easier and faster without such abstractions
T 1472050772 18<akurtakov18>	also lsp4j had this xtend/xtext dep, right? 
T 1472050795 18<akurtakov18>	we already suffer from the emf/platform circular dep so adding one more is definetely bad idea
T 1472050891 18<akurtakov18>	and again platform and jdt are built together (due to historical reasons) and breaking this circle requires effort
T 1472050905 18<akurtakov18>	once this done - jdt could use way more deps 
T 1472050968 18<akurtakov18>	everytime one adds such "innocent" small circle dep he/she slows the next iteration significantly
