You should have more info about what's wrong in the mail body, but at first sight, I would say that's because the issue is set to be fixed in 4.4.1.AM1 which is past and the issue is still opened.

T 1470239914 18<rgrunber18>	mbooth: one question about the bug in rh-eclipse. when vkadlcik_gone outlined the steps to reproduce, those are things that worked on dts-4.. and not thing that worked on rh-eclipse prior to my patch.. right ?
T 1470239986 18<rgrunber18>	ah .. umm nvm.. yeah it would imply the patch failed..
T 1470240006 18<rgrunber18>	since for 3 to fail all of 1-2 had to work..
T 1470240262 18<mbooth18>	Yeah, everything except installation worked on rh-eclipse prior to the patch
T 1470240357 18<rgrunber18>	mbooth: what i'm seeing is that no platform bundle is detected by the target platform which seems unrelated.. i'll debug it to see.
T 1470240367 18<rgrunber18>	which would explain why it isn't being found.

T 1470245412 18<rgrunber18>	yup.. so first patch caused issues likely because it wasn't completed.. and p2.runnable is needed.
T 1470245455 18<rgrunber18>	in fact what occured is bundles.info never got generated in the user's $HOME/.eclipse.. so of course target platform generation failed... because it was looking for the bundles.info there.

T 1470254402 18<mbooth18>	rgrunber: I just sent you a script and a spec file...
T 1470254445 18<rgrunber18>	i'm guessing you want me to build it..
T 1470254461 18<mbooth18>	(Based on your original script) Running this script should result in a binary RPM that installs some droplets generated from p2 repos
T 1470254492 18<mbooth18>	Yes please, also please take a look to see if its sane
T 1470254528 18<mbooth18>	Actually a yum repo, not just a binary rpm
T 1470254531 18<rgrunber18>	ahh.. one thing i probably also missed from the repo2runnable script, the option '-flagAsRunnable'
T 1470254658 18<rgrunber18>	so basically you assume some source folder exists called %{?scl_prefix}devstudio.tar.gz or whatnot.. you extract its contents.. then you call feature/bundle publisher to create the p2 repo from it.. i mean the paths would need to match up.. between the location of those bundles and 'file:$(pwd)/p2-repo'..
T 1470254718 18<mbooth18>	The build.sh generates the tarball and the srpm, so paths should always br correct
T 1470254725 18<rgrunber18>	ah.. d'oh
T 1470254787 18<rgrunber18>	ah.. build.sh is the thing being executed
T 1470254802 18<mbooth18>	Yes, that wasn't clear, sorry
T 1470254904 18<mbooth18>	Assumptions made: Machine you are running this on can run mock (Fedora, probably) and you are inside the firewall (so you can build RHEL7 chroot)
T 1470254937 18<mbooth18>	My thinking is that using mock should give pretty reproducible results outside of brew
T 1470255101 18<rgrunber18>	k seems to be working.. downloaded stuff.. wrote the srpm..
T 1470255130 18<rgrunber18>	doing the mock build now...
T 1470255306 18<rgrunber18>	mbooth: there's one improvement that could be made from that 'p2_feature_curl' thing i wrote.. and that's to actually call the director to install the units. it would require the user list all repositories (like http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon) but we could do some logic afterwards like.. is this bundle from the p2 repo we care about or one of the others.. and decide whether to add it to the 
T 1470255312 18<rgrunber18>	droplet on that criteria.
T 1470255339 18<rgrunber18>	^ that would give us things like docker-client, jersey, ... in the case of linuxtools.docker.. instead of forcing there to be some feature that lists everything.
T 1470255564 18<rgrunber18>	mbooth: yeah i guess for reproducibility you'd need to run it inside mock.. is it worth supplying an option in the future for the user to point to their own eclipse install.. i mean it'd be much faster should they choose that..
T 1470255611 18<mbooth18>	Well, second run is faster since the mock root is cached
T 1470255707 18<mbooth18>	And it's kind of just going be hooked into their existing deploy process -- I don't see people wanting to invoke this manually that much
T 1470255801 18<mbooth18>	I see what you mean about improving 'p2_feature_curl' though
T 1470255950 18<rgrunber18>	yeah we need p2's dep resolution greatness.. but then we want to remove all jars that came from somewhere else... or ... i think if we somehow use the system eclipse's profile.. it should.. not bring in the whole platform..
T 1470255956 18<rgrunber18>	something to test though...
T 1470256178 18<rgrunber18>	yay building the rpm..

T 1470256447 18<mbooth18>	Building a second time should be super quick (the whole of maven is in the build root, a bit unnecessarily for this)

T 1470755116 18<mbooth18>	vkadlcik: I don't think you will have missed anything vital, there was mostly just talk about BZ/Jira integration :-)
T 1470755133 18<rgrunber18>	mbooth: so about the p2_feature_curl part, i'm guessing that currently doesn't pick up transitive dependencies.. ie only stuff that's a direct dep of the feature ?
T 1470755154 18<vkadlcik18>	mbooth: thanks
T 1470755269 18<mbooth18>	rgrunber: Yes -- but I did add an option to download a "whole" update site (i.e. if you don't specify a feature it lists all IUs with a jar payload and downloads everything)
T 1470755298 18<rgrunber18>	mbooth: yup, i think i saw it in the updated version.
T 1470755311 18<nboldt18>	mbenitez: mbooth: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22966
T 1470755333 18<nboldt18>	If I missed anything important or screwed anything up, please edit the JIRA or throw comments on it
T 1470755412 18<rgrunber18>	i mentioned it before a bit but was thinking of changing that to call the p2 director to install the feature.group iu (with empty profile specified). this way script only needs to specify the main p2 repo, and the locatin of other repos for which platform/additional content exists. from there we just remove the additional content and are left with just the jars needed from the main repo.
T 1470755443 18<rgrunber18>	added benefit would be that it should support composites since director takes care of it.
T 1470755469 18<mbenitez18>	nboldt, thank you! I had it in my TODO to file the issue as you requested :)
T 1470755493 18<nboldt18>	rgrunber: I'm going to be doing something very similar for the rh-eclipse46-devstudio rpm creation
T 1470755501 18<nboldt18>	rgrunber: we should combine forces :D
T 1470755533 18<nboldt18>	mbenitez: 
T 1470755570 18<nboldt18>	mbenitez: one question ... not sure I'll be able to get this written this week as well as getting the RPM stuff prototyped. I'm going to assume bzira scrape is less important than rpm creation
T 1470755592 18<mbenitez18>	vkadlcik_gone, thank you for joining!
T 1470755686 18<rgrunber18>	nboldt: yeah, so the problem i want to address is that generally features don't include *everything* they need, so for linuxtools.docker you probably won't get jersey*,jnr*,jackson* even though they should be in the droplet.
T 1470755737 18<nboldt18>	ah, then the feature owner should revamp the feature (or better, its plugins) to proeprly declare dependencies and versions
T 1470755749 18<nboldt18>	don't fix this in your tool. make the projects upstream behave correctly :D
T 1470755759 18<nboldt18>	rgrunber: ^
T 1470755802 18<rgrunber18>	nboldt: well, not really, because that's how features work. a feature just says "these are things i'm providing that i own".. it would kinda be abusing osgi if you decided to include everything needed.
T 1470755837 18<mbooth18>	Eclipse features are an abuse of OSGi anyway :-p
T 1470755858 18<rgrunber18>	i mean if you ran the director it works fine.. problem is when you query a feature for its dependencies, you'll only get the immediate plugins.. not all deps recursively.
T 1470755863 18<nboldt18>	rgrunber: MANIFEEST.MF in plugins are SUPPOSED to define their deps
T 1470755896 18<nboldt18>	feature is a more loose definition of requirements but you can certainly set includes AND deps in feature.xml
T 1470755919 18<nboldt18>	best practices says to do the dep declaration in the plugins, but if there's a good reason to move that into the feature, it can be done there too
T 1470755923 18<nboldt18>	(or instead)
T 1470755951 18<mbooth18>	I think you are agreeing with one another...
T 1470755953 18<nboldt18>	tldr, the problem is in the upstream plugins' MANIFEST.MF files. Fix those and your tools will work correctly
T 1470755977 18<rgrunber18>	yeah.. so that's what i'm getting at.. if we just call the director, we'll get what we need.
T 1470756060 18<rgrunber18>	what we're doing now is getting just the feature.group requirements.. and stopping there.. or downloading the entire repo, which i guess would assume the repo is a 1-1 mapping with the droplet content.. which again might not be true upstream.
T 1470756197 18<nboldt18>	exactly. director (or p2.mirror) is better than whatever else you're using as it doesn't read p2 metadata
T 1470756205 18<nboldt18>	it = whatever else
T 1470756236 18<nboldt18>	director will install things (unpack jars); p2.mirror will simply copy them as is
T 1470756239 18<rgrunber18>	nboldt: well the feature getting thing works in some special cases (feature defines everything needed, entire p2 repo is the droplet)
T 1470756426 18<rgrunber18>	nboldt: i mean i don't mind working on this if i can get some time.. i had something written up, but unless you're already working on it..
T 1470756554 18<nboldt18>	I need to (re)create a script that can, for a list of features, produce an update site
T 1470756573 18<nboldt18>	I think that might be a different usecase than you if you're using director to unpack the features
T 1470756664 18<rgrunber18>	nboldt: so given an update site and list of features, it produces a more compact update site ?..
T 1470756675 18<rgrunber18>	excluding non-essential stuff.
T 1470756692 18<nboldt18>	yes
T 1470756703 18<nboldt18>	that's what I need for the rh-eclipse46-devstudio RPM
T 1470756710 18<nboldt18>	based on mbooth's build.sh script
T 1470756719 18<rgrunber18>	nboldt: it's quite similar. we want to do the same, except our final output is a droplet, not another update site.
T 1470756728 18<rgrunber18>	oh.. :P hah
T 1470756743 18<nboldt18>	is a droplet "given an update site, install everything in it" ?
T 1470756796 18<rgrunber18>	nboldt: droplet is just an update site that has had the repo2runnable task run on it with -createFragments.
T 1470756846 18<nboldt18>	ah... so yes. same use case then
T 1470756859 18<nboldt18>	I believe the rh-eclipse46-devstudio RPM is thus "a droplet" too :D
T 1470756864 18*	nboldt is learning the terms here
T 1470756952 18<rgrunber18>	nboldt: basically i'm saying, if we modify the p2_feature_curl method in build.sh to call the director to install.. and do a bit of pruning of unnecessary things, then you no longer need to do what you were going to do.. or at least do less..
T 1470757004 18<nboldt18>	rgrunber: oh... that's cool
T 1470757024 18<nboldt18>	that would possibly save time / effort and be reusable for your stuff too
T 1470757049 18<nboldt18>	I'll be in the office this afternoon so we can talk more in person (if you're in today)
T 1470757064 18<rgrunber18>	nboldt: the only thing that i'd need to know, is would there be some kind of update site that contains things like "org.eclipse.ui, org.eclipse.platform, ... base platform stuff"
T 1470757081 18<nboldt18>	yes! we have that 
T 1470757083 18<rgrunber18>	ie. that is used in devtools product ..
T 1470757091 18<rgrunber18>	worst case i use releases/neon or whatnot
T 1470757123 18<nboldt18>	point director at https://devstudio.jboss.com/10.0/stable/updates/ and if it can scrape children of the composite all the deps you need should be there

T 1470757143 18<nboldt18>	since that site contains devstudio + devstudio target platform
T 1470757172 18<nboldt18>	rgrunber: we also have the same site as 4 zips, if you want to play offline and save b/w download time for iterative experiments
T 1470757201 18<nboldt18>	zips are linked on https://devstudio.jboss.com/10.0/stable/updates/ in the right hand column under "Offline Install"
T 1470757204 18<nboldt18>	rgrunber: ^
T 1470757403 18<rgrunber18>	yeah i'll have to play around with things.. a lot of this work will vary depending on what assumptions/input data is being given.
T 1470757447 18<nboldt18>	yep
T 1470757562 18<rgrunber18>	nboldt: oh final thing :P , is there any plan to map issue states (NEW,ASSIGNED,..,VERIFIED,CLOSED) into jira ?
T 1470757611 18<rgrunber18>	can be slight pain to remember to change a bug twice (once in bz, once in jira)
T 1470757612 18<nboldt18>	currently no, the tool only creates the JIRA
T 1470757631 18<nboldt18>	but in future yes, we could have VERIFIED => resolved, CLOSED -> closed
T 1470757644 18<nboldt18>	add that to the JIRA I opened (or make a subtask?)

T 1470775009 18<nboldt18>	haven't used assoc arrays in bash in a while but I don't recall that... just that you had to type-declare the object before loading it.

T 1470924550 18<mbooth18>	nboldt: Thanks for Jira formatting hints :-) BTW, is there no "quote" or "reply" button? I can't find one
T 1470925041 18<nboldt18>	there's just "comment"
T 1470925044 18<nboldt18>	mbooth: ^
T 1470925087 18<nboldt18>	mbooth: sorta like bugzilla in that respect. but NOT like bugzilla, you can do all kinds of formatting and even emojis
T 1470925121 18<nboldt18>	you will learn to love {quote} and {code} and !image.png! and [^somefile.txt] 
T 1470925136 18<mbooth18>	nboldt: I guess I just miss replying to comments in-line like I would with email/bugzilla 
T 1470925153 18<mbooth18>	Copy/pasting someone's reply loses formatting :-(
T 1470925157 18<nboldt18>	yeah, you can do that with RCM tickets, which are backed by jira/confluence
T 1470925178 18<nboldt18>	mbooth: you can EDIT someone's comment to get it as code, then paste that
T 1470925216 18<mbooth18>	I can edit other folks' comments? That sounds... dangerous :-o
T 1470925292 18<nboldt18>	well, I can. maybe that's only an admin ability
T 1470925315 18<nboldt18>	which reminds me I need to find someone with JIRA God Mode Powers to add a new project, RHECLIPSE

T 1470931826 18<nboldt18>	dumb question... http://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/overview/ says "ON WINDOWS 8:" but surely the OpenJDK .msi installer works on Win 7/8/8.1/10 ?
T 1470931873 18<nboldt18>	followup dumb question, where do I report a bug in that doc? JIRA -> DEVELOPER issue? 
T 1470931885 18<nboldt18>	mbenitez: patrickm: ^
T 1470931947 18<mbenitez18>	nboldt, the first question would be for dbhole / omajid they are in #toronto [in a team mtg in Westford now]
T 1470931965 18<mbenitez18>	the second I don't know but let me find, it's something we'll just need more and more
T 1470932092 18<nboldt18>	mbenitez: https://issues.jboss.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=3362&projectKey=DEVELOPER is where I generally open issues for developers.redhat.com updates (eg., to release new devstudio)
T 1470932109 18<nboldt18>	but thought maybe you guys would have a different process for openjdk (eg.., bugzilla?)
T 1470932146 18<mbenitez18>	nboldt, I think that should be it then, tbh we haven't filed anything yet
T 1470932512 18<nboldt18>	mbenitez: I've opened https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DEVELOPER-3393 to track the problem
T 1470932553 18<mbenitez18>	nboldt, thanks Nick! for that and teaching me where to report this stuff :)
T 1470932655 18<nboldt18>	mbenitez: no problem. next, I need to introduce you to Paul Robinson, who can usually escalate things in DEVELOPER when they get stuck
T 1470932680 18<nboldt18>	(He's @Paul in hipchat.)
T 1470932734 18<mbenitez18>	nboldt, that would be nice, I need to open a request to post an Eclipse Infocentre, finally I'll have connections on this website
T 1470932819 18<nboldt18>	oh god, really? You want an infocentre on developers.redhat.com? 
T 1470932834 18<nboldt18>	(I assume you mean something like http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp ?
T 1470932886 18<nboldt18>	mbenitez: or do you mean simply linking to docs on eclipse.org like the SystemTap UG? http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.doc%2FLinux_Tools_Project%2FSystemtap%2FUser_Guide%2FUser-Guide.html
T 1470932933 18<mbenitez18>	nboldt, yes, like that: http://infocenter-mbooth.rhcloud.com/index.jsp
T 1470932966 18<mbenitez18>	nboldt, mbooth put this together long time ago and we just couldn't get follow up on where to host it, the developer portal should be the right place
T 1470933003 18<mbenitez18>	at the time we were talking to rkratky he didn't know who to contact yet, but finally all the pieces are coming together
T 1470933005 18<nboldt18>	I bet you'll need to rebrand that before you can put it there
T 1470933033 18<nboldt18>	yeah, rob should talk to @paul about how to host it (or if we can host it)
T 1470933041 18<mbenitez18>	absolutely, the design was just temporary, to show other how this could be branded for the product
T 1470933051 18<nboldt18>	could dump the whole thing into github I guess :D
T 1470933086 18<mbenitez18>	nboldt, glad to have you around, you have a lot of insights into the processes :)
T 1470933087 18<nboldt18>	mbenitez: that would be here: https://github.com/redhat-developer/developers.redhat.com
T 1470933131 18<nboldt18>	probably more like here: https://github.com/redhat-developer/developers.redhat.com/tree/master/products/developertoolset
T 1470933147 18<mbenitez18>	nice!
T 1470933171 18<mbenitez18>	I'll open a trello card to start tracking this again, and of course a jira
T 1470933201 18<nboldt18>	yeah. (aside: there's a great asciidoctor.js plugin for Chrome which is awesome for testing .adoc files locally before pushing them as a PR or having to use rake to build them)
T 1470933283 18<nboldt18>	mbenitez: I suppose the other option would be for rkratky to look at publishing the infocentre as another "multiple html pages" format and have it here: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-developer-toolset/
T 1470933311 18<mbenitez18>	it seems like a good project to include with the consolidation / UX improvements we're working towards
T 1470933335 18<nboldt18>	eg., another "Paged HTML" document like https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/4/html/4.1_Release_Notes/index.html
T 1470933349 18<mbenitez18>	nboldt, we talked about that but there were some concerns about the content not being internally created IIRC
T 1470933350 18<nboldt18>	again, Brand might complain about that idea, but *shrug*
T 1470933365 18<mbenitez18>	haha no kidding, processes... ;)
T 1470933373 18<nboldt18>	internally created? where did mbooth build the infocentre?
T 1470933519 18<mbooth18>	nboldt: The infocenter is *built* here, but much of the content was written upstream -- it was the origin of the content that was the concern, IIRC
T 1470933563 18<mbenitez18>	I think so too
T 1470933655 18<nboldt18>	mbooth: oic. another "NIH" paranoia event
T 1470933658 18<mbooth18>	But it seems silly that even appropriately licensed documentation cannot be rehosted...
T 1470933662 18<mbooth18>	Exactly
T 1470933676 18<nboldt18>	mbooth: yeah, "silly" is one word for it
T 1470933693 18<nboldt18>	are they worried that the doc source isn't open enough, being html?
T 1470933717 18*	nboldt points the lawyers at the CTRL and Y keys and tell them to view-source:
T 1470933733 18<nboldt18>	(ctrl-U I mean)
T 1470933753 18<mbooth18>	nboldt: TBH, I don't remember. But it's nothing that isn't already shipped inside an RPM...
T 1470933796 18<nboldt18>	mbooth: ah, so if it's good enough to be IN RHEL it should be good enough to be online discussing what's IN RHEL
T 1470933829 18<mbenitez18>	I don't think we got to legal last time, things just got lost in conversations and we never made it close to publish
T 1470934146 18<mbenitez18>	nboldt, I opened https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DEVELOPER-3394 does it look good to you?
T 1470934160 18*	mbenitez has lost the JIRA-fu over time
T 1470934185 18<mbenitez18>	also added the description to trello
T 1470934198 18<nboldt18>	mbenitez: you should cross link them
T 1470934219 18<mbenitez18>	add the trello card to JIRA?
T 1470934222 18<nboldt18>	eg., JIRA -> More > Link > Web Link > url for the trello card
T 1470934231 18<mbenitez18>	ok, will do
T 1470934258 18<nboldt18>	Trello > card > add Checklist > add checklist item = https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DEVELOPER-3394
T 1470934281 18<nboldt18>	that way the info is in both places and PgM can track from their side / devs can track from their side, etc.
T 1470934289 18<nboldt18>	it's more time/effort but imho it helps :D
T 1470934395 18<mbenitez18>	good idea, it doesn't hurt :)
T 1470934673 18<nboldt18>	DEVELOPER-3394 is assigned to James Cobb (our branding guy)
T 1470935850 18<patrickm18>	nboldt: where in the doc does it say Windows 8?
T 1470935868 18<patrickm18>	ah, in *BOLD*
T 1470935925 18<patrickm18>	arrrgh, they still didn't change the Red Hat OpenJDK title

T 1470939914 18<nboldt18>	patrickm: no worries. we're all blind from time to time
T 1470940058 18<patrickm18>	nboldt: i was looking for it in the text... that's my excuse and I'm sticking with that story
T 1470940252 18<nboldt18>	patrickm: lol, no problem
T 1470940270 18<nboldt18>	I opened the JIRA before noticing that there's RHEL 6 in there too (no mention of RHEL 7)

T 1471013974 18<patrickm18>	nboldt: i talked with dbhole, there is not restriction in the .msi that states it should only install on Windows 8

T 1471014025 18<patrickm18>	nboldt: it seems to be an oversight, there were so many "8"'s on that page
T 1471014254 18<nboldt18>	patrickm: yeah, felt like an overzealous regex matching
T 1471014265 18<nboldt18>	patrickm: but that doesn't explain the RHEL 6 mention :D
T 1471014296 18<nboldt18>	more likely this page was boilerplated from a year or two ago before Win10 and RHEL 7 were things we support
T 1471014312 18<patrickm18>	nboldt: it does, because the pkg names are different
