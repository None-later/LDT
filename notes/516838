- Often it's not clear if a global variable is webkit1-only, webkit2-only or
  used by both. This makes code reading/debugging paintful/annoying.
  Add w1 or w2 or w1_w2_ prefix to variables and methods to make it clear
  when they are used.
- Put webkit1 code into If (WEBKIT1) and webkit2 code into if (WEBKIT2) for clarity.
