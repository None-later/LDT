▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇►  sh__Polymorphism
TAG_Interview_Question - I was asked this. 

MEANING: Greak: many forms 

Personal:
Write sub-classes, these sub-classes use methods of the super class. 
E.g in my art program, I could call "draw" on all objects even though they were different. 

• Single interface for many types 	
	- e.g function overloading. 

Web:
Generally, the ability to appear in many forms. In object-oriented programming, polymorphism refers to a programming language''s ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes. For example, given a base class shape, polymorphism enables the programmer to define different area methods for any number of derived classes, such as circles, rectangles and triangles. No matter what shape an object is, applying the area method to it will return the correct results. Polymorphism is considered to be a requirement of any true object-oriented programming language (OOPL).

In OOP, a Virtual function is when a function or method can be overriden with an inheriting class with a function that has the same signature. 


Parent : draw()
Child  : draw()  << overrides parent

▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇►  sh__pure_virtual_function
A function that is required to be implemented by a sub-class 


▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇►  sh__principles_of_object_oriented_design

• Abstraction
• Polymorphism
• Inheritence 
• Encapsulation 
	-- restrict access to methods in objects 
	-- building of data with methods 


▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇►  sh__Virtual_addresses 
 - Abstraction, so programs refer to virtual memory instead of phisical memory 
 - allows more programs to be held in memory
