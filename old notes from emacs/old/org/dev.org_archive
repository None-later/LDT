=====================================================================
=========================================== Week 47
=====================================================================

# Week 47
## LAST WEEK
. DEV: (85%)
	 . 428852 Broken Drag and Drop
    - Wrote fix that makes DND work on two widgets in a shell.
    - Discovered that DND doesn't work if widgets are inside containers.
    - Investigated / narrowed down DND container issue.

    Now notes are very tidy.

## THIS WEEK:
 - 428852 Fix broken Drag and Drop
 


-------- Side note:
In general, it's taking a while to fix DND as there was 
a lot of 'Knowledge Dependencies'.
I.e, fair bit of time was spent learning.

DND Knowledge Dependencies:
.GTK 
  -> GTK Signal/Event Handling 
  -> GTK Widget hierarchy
  -> DND in GTK 
    --> background Knowledge (atom/selection/target tables/target lists)
    --> Source, setup, signals and handles 
    --> Destination, setup, signals and handles 
    --> DND memory management 
  -> Container hierarchy & logic  (Grid/Bin/box)
  -> Understanding various Libraries (Gdk/Gtk/GObject/Glib)

# Week 48 2014.12.01 

## LAST WEEK
. DEV WORK (95%)
  . 428852 Broken Drag and Drop: 
    - Wrote test cases to test DnD on various containers.
    - Identified why DnD didn't work work for Group. 
        // This was tricky, group nested it's children as 'siblings', 
        // which causes signals to get lost. I figured it out as I was making a diagram of 
        // SWT <-to-> GTK Handler logic: )
        // https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeoUfimtsev/gitPicStore/master/tmp_dnd_group_fix.pdf
    - Fixed Group so that children are added as 'children'
    - Now repairing error messages that are seen as part of the group fix.

## THIS WEEK:
.  428852 Broken Drag and Drop: 
  - Complete fix for SWTGroup

    Now SWT's DNDExample.java works 
  - started writing some test cases to automate testing. 

. Triage (4%)
  - Helped a guy with a thread-saftey issue:
  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=453743

## THIS_WEEK
 . Fix DND for SWT.TabFolder 
 . then fix DND for SWT.ExpandBar
 . then Test other widgets for DND functionality 
 
 
 ===============================  
 Last Days of December / January 2015:
 . DEV  WORK: 
  . (2 hours) Fixed SWT/GTK's acquirement of primary monitor : Bug 455691
  
  . (Many days) TabFolder (close to completion) [complex business]
      - Changed hierarchy structure that was written 12 years ago,
        the complex part was understanding Tabfolder's architecture and 
        figuring out what was wrong with it. See *1.
      - This resolved DND issue.
      
      - Performed in-depth testing of TabFolder's features *2
      - Discovered many new issues caused by hierarchy change.
        (child positioning / child Control disposal etc.. )
      - Been fixing newly arisen issues one by one. 
      - 7/86 Junit tests still fail. Currently working on fixing those.
    
 . LEARN 
  - SWT's widget dispose/release mechanism


NEXT: 
 - Finish Tabfolder
 - Start on other widgets with broken DND. (ExpandBar etc..)

Appendix:
*1: Created diagram of SWT to understand TabFolder & SWT disposal mechanism:
https://github.com/LeoUfimtsev/gitPicStore/blob/master/SWT_mapping.pdf?raw=true

*2:
Besides existing Junit tests, I wrote additional 'manual' tests to test things
that can't be tested via automated tests : ~500+ lines.

 - My previous TabFolder architecture fix broke Marketplace plugin. 
 - I improved re-parenting logic to handle such a case.
 - Added a JUnit test case into swtTest to catch such issues in the future.

- [ ] Ping alex about api change
:DETAILS:
Too bad it didn't work on Win32. 

>..1:1 ... the constraint should be documented
Well, to be precise, in the documentation:
http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fswt%2Fwidgets%2FTabFolder.html

It says: 
"children are created and then set into a tab"
i.e, 'a tab' (singular)
it does not say 'tabs' (plural) nor suggest support for this.

So if I understand correctly, the documentation implicidly states a 1:1 relationship. At the very least there is no explicid support for multiple parantage neither in the documentation nore in the code.

In Control:setParent(..) it states that in general, reparenting isn't supported by all platforms:
http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Control.html#setParent(org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite)

As such, technically speaking this doesn't break api. It's more like it just so happened that it worked before.
There are few ways that controls work correctly, but many ways that controls don't work correctly. I think it makes sense to document only the former as otherwise documentation would become very large.

In general, the notion of Tabfolder is that each tab has it's own control. 
Why only use a single viewer as oppose to multiple viewers? If they share functionality, wouldn't it make sense to create an abstract class and sub-class child viewers off of that?

A quick workaround would be to use CTabFolder, (Such behaviour currently works in CTabFolder), but it's not guaranteed that it'll work in the

- [X] look at GtkNotebook tutorials, to see if alternative add-tab method possible
- [X] Traverse GtkNotebook & hierarchy to see if there is some useful method.
- [X] Fixed aquiring parent (gtk_..get_paret()). Set control during selection.

DEV 
 . Bug 458844 - [GTK3] TabItem hierarchy change breaks shared control.
   - Previous change exposed incorrect code in Market Place Client.
   - Wrote patch to improve reparenting. 

   -> Bug 148082 - [Common] using TabItem.setControl doesn't work properly (is hidden) if control is inside TabFolder already. 
     - Wrote patches for all affected platforms (GTK/Win32/Cocoa).
     - All platforms were tested, all works -> Merged.
     - This was blocking a bug in Market Place Client, #458846, as a result they can now move on.

 . Found & Investigated Bug in GTK Inspector. (Hierarchy does not change after set-Parent)
    - Submitted bug to (gtk bugzilla 743889)
    - This bug affected much of my work on figuring out DND issues. Now that I'm aware of it, I know better how to work around it.

 . SWT Triage 

LEARN 
 - Learned Eclipse RCP a bit, to narrow down PlatformUI issues.
 - Troubleshooted RCP example (breakage on my Eclipse Luna-config)

DOCU 
 - Blog: Split large 'clean code with Eclipse' article into two parts as per Mike's request.
 - Updated SWT triage page with info on Tagging. (GTK/Cocoa/Win32)
 - Bug 454214 - Please add "How to contribute to SWT" link to https://www.eclipse.org/swt/ 

* Week 7 [2015-02-17 Tue]
COMPLETED:
- Bug 459595 - [GTK] remove deprecated gtk tree rules_hint on GTK 3
- White space removal for Table.java 

IN PROGRESS:
. Bug 459487 - [GTK] Replace deprecated gtk_arrow_* with gtk_image
 - Setting up RHEL 6 and RHEL 7 VMS to test patches on RHEL vms.
 - Now learning/installing DTS on VMS 

Bugzilla Triage. 

Configuration of workstation:
 - Wrote small script to automate .so building (for java <-> gtk bindings).
 - Consolidated several productivity systems (todo, task planning, notes, calendar, 
   pomodoro[time planning]) into Emacs-org-mode. 
   This makes it much easier to work on tasks in a systematic way, (like avoiding forgetting things),
   manage task-related notes and helps produce weekly reports more automatically.
