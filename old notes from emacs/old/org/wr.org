Dev
 - Bug 461616 - [GTK3] Combo improvements in background/foreground for gtk3
   - Fixed Foreground issue,  (gdk -> gkt)
   - Investigated & fixed Background issue (that caused jUnit test case to fail). (this was tricky). 
   ->  Ran into gtk2 build issues with integrating the gtk3 background fix.
       There is a problem making "overloaded" functions dynamic. Spent time looking for a solution.

- Investgiated other locations for replacing *-gdk with *-rgba. (Tree/Table)
- Set up Fedora 20 vm for testing.

Learning 
 - GTK: GtkColor and GdkRGBA
 - SWT: Learned aboub Combo widget's internals.
 - UML: learned about Sequence diagrams and PlantUML sequence. 
   Used what I learned to map out SWT's Combo box to help fix bug 461616

This week:
DEVELOPMENT:
 Finished:
 - Bug 461616 – {GTK3} Combo improvements in background/foreground for gtk3
   - With help of Alex: resolved a Gtk2 build issue.
     An overloaded function had an arguments that were both gtk2/gtk3.
     SWT Tools can't make overloaded functions dynamic.
     As such, there were build errors on gtk2 due to gtk3-only struct.
     Had to write a bit of custom C code into os.c

 Triage:
 -  Analysed request: [[https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=461767][Bug 461767 – Add an unsycnhronized Display.isCurrentThread() method]]    
     Request from Platform UI folks about adding api to Display.java.
     I read about volotile variables for in multi-threaded applications to understand the request:
     http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp06197/index.html#listing3
     Provided technical response. (good with me).

 In Progress:
 - Bug 462009 – {Gtk3} Button background Color fix
   - Fixed background color of button.  (Buttons will soon have background colors in Gtk3)
   - Investigating why jUnit test case doesn't work. (in progress)
 - Label miss-alignment issues on Gtk. Exposed by my earlier fix: 461073 
     Label alignment broke after one of my previous patches.
     Investigated and narrowed down to an issue in Gtk3.16<. 
     Gtk folks deprecated a function in Gtk3.14 and did not provide alternate api:
     https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=735841
     But now is fixed in Gtk3.16. I'll add fix to SWT next week.

CONFIGURATION:
 - Learned about jFace standlone development.
 - Set up personal repo for jFace Tests. 
   I now use these to narrow down Platform.UI issues down to the SWT level. 
   (as with label alignment issue)
   https://github.com/LeoUfimtsev/LeojFaceTests 

LEARNINING:
- (~2 hours) Studied some UML.
- (~5 hours) Gtk notions: 
  - GtkStyleContext / Gtk3 Theming /
  - Gtk3 Alignment, interesting article:
    http://www.murrayc.com/permalink/2015/03/02/gtk-aligning-justification-in-text-widgets/


Next Week:
  - patch up SWT Label/Button to fix alignment issue as per gtk:
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=735841
  - Investigate jUnit gtk3 test failure on SWT Button backgroundcolor
 
** DONE Week 12 2015.03.23 
CLOSED: [2015-03-27 Fri 17:10]
DEV DONE:
 . Bug 461767 - Add an unsycnhronized Display.isCurrentThread() method 
   - This received a lot of attention (9 people in cc)
   - Implemented method for Gtk/Cocoa/Win32.
   - Wrote jUnit test cases to verify multi-threading functionality for method.

. Label miss-alignment issues on Gtk 461073
   - Implemented fix for correct label assignment for single-line labels 
   - Tested on newer Versions of Gtk (Fedora 22) 

DEV IN PROGRESS:
. Bug 462009 - [Gtk3] Button background Color 
  - Issues with background color for the case when you have  
    SWT Checkbox, SWT Radio, for certain themes.
    (Checking a checkbox has no 'visible' effects on unthemed environments).
  - Compiled and tested various gtk versions (gtk3.8, .10, .12, .13) to 
    observe different behaviours.
 
DEV GENERAL:
 - Bugzilla Triage.

LEARNING: 
 . Gtk bisect 
  - Automatically figure out which commit broke a test case. 
    (or in my case, build the newest gtk my system is able to compile). 
** DONE Week 13 2015.03.27 
CLOSED: [2015-03-27 Fri 17:10]
DEV DONE: 
 - Bug 462009 - Gtk3 Button Background Color fix (#2)
     Checkbox/Radio buttons were not visible for certain themes when background was filled.
     (Ubuntu, plain Gtk)
     Now they are visible again. 
     Issue was use of 'background-image' instead of 'background' CSS property.

- Bug 461767 - Add an unsycnhronized Display.isCurrentThread() method 
   Investigated build issues with Gerrit : Api + test case issue. 

DEV IN PROGRESS:
 - Bug 462009 - Gtk3 Button Background Color fix (#3)
     Further improve checkbox/radio. Currently they inherit theming from OS theme.
     This casuses a clash if you use a bright OS theme and dark Eclipse theme:
     https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=251938  (white checkboxes)

     Ideally we want them to always go along with Eclipse theme to look like this:
     https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=251937  (dark checkboxes)
     
     In Gtk, Checkbox does not seem to respect 'background' CSS property.
     I'm investigating if this behaviour can be overriden somehow.
     
LEARN: 
 - Gtk3 Theming 
   Reading Api documentaion, Blogs, tutorials, trying out native snippets of code.
   Seeking solution to 462009.

   My Acumilated notes on GtkTheming:
   http://leoufimtsev.github.io./org/gtk.html#ID-018c57bf-2db9-44d2-91dc-cda37fd6aa53   

- RHCSA material 
  - Chapter 1 : local/remote(ssh) login.

NEXT WEEK:
 - My effort is currently focused on fixing theme related issues. 
   E.g read-only combobox, black background in javadoc etc...

:END:      
DEV: 
  - 461616 SWT Combo 'Read only' theaming issue:
    Fixed the issue for SWT combo not getting the correct color if 'SWT.READ_ONLY' style used.
    This was because SWT.Combo is composed of several nested Gtk widgets and the background
    color did not perculate to the correct gtk widget.

    Now I noticed that combo's menu's don't get proper background color. I am working on fixing that.

  - 463733 Button background color for SWT.RADIO and SWT.CHECK:
    Check/radio buttons were not visible under some themes as their border color was that of
    background color of theme.  Made check/radio buttons to match the text font. 
    Because themes are designed so that text foreground/backgrounds are visible, this ensures
    that check/radio buttons should also be visible. (for themes that don't hard-code icons).

  - Triage 
    Bug 462059 - [CSS] [Dark] Active button does not look well.
      - Appears to be an Ubuntu theaming issue. Not specifically SWT.
    Bug 463620 - [CSS][Dark][Gkt3] No dark icons for Checkbox/Radio.
      -> discussed notion of introducing icons into Eclipse CSS Theme. 
      -> But after discussion, unfortunately this would not port well to Win32/Cocoa.
      -> Thus dropped the idea in favor of using dark version of theme if one is available 
         on Linux.

WDEV
 Bug 461616 - [GTK3] Combo improvements in background/foreground
  - Improved menu drop down for combo as much as possible 
  - Investigated possibilities of styling sub-widgets in GTK with CSS. 
  - Wrote Blog entry explaining what's possible and what is not (see below).

 Bug 457476 - [GTK3] DND issue with overlapping widgets w/ absolute positioning.
   (formerly known as Fast-View DnD issue).
   - Sopot pointed out that DnD's drop is not lost, but goes to underlying widget (thank you Sopot).
   - Wrote snippet of code to reproduce issue. 
   - Narrowed down to Draw & Drop precedence issue. 
     I.e, in SWT, what is drawn first is on top. What is drawn after is on the bottom.
     But with DnD gtk3, what is drawn last becomes the first drop target.
   - Investigating possibility to revert this behaviour in Gtk3.

 Bugzilla Triage.

Blog:
Making Eclipse Darker
 - Explained the limits of GtkCSS and what we can do on the SWT level.

# include previous week
Had PTO last friday. 
Was ill Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday.

DEV:
 - Tied Gtk source code into Eclipse, figured out how to debug Gtk part of an SWT application inside Eclipse.
   I.e, with this when I run an SWT application, I can set breakpoints in Gtk code and step between java and C code.
   This was rather complicated, as I first had to learn about C debugging, Gdb, linking large C libraries together, 
   figure out how to attach Eclipse to a running proccess, re-compile Gtk with debugging flags. (Roland helped a lot, thank you).
   But it doesn't quite work for custom SWT_Fixed code yet. Investigating...
 - Investigated DnD issue with overlapping widgets by stepping through gtk code. (In Progress).

*** Weekly Meeting summary:
Meh:
 - Broad way demo setup (Had some issues with Eclipse freezing)
 - Tested Sopot's theme change plugin (looks good)
 - Lars asked about dark buttons when they are active.
  -> cross platform solution not possible, but I
   wrote a snippet about making buttons darker with a listener.

Other:
 - Reviewed Gtk Monitor client area patch.
 - Helped new SWT dev with his setup.
  (he submitted a monitor patch similar to what I did)
  (he was getting unsatisfied link errors)
 - Clarified bits in the gudie 
  - Made ToC dynamic.

Dev:
 - Need to see what's happening in Gtk.
 - Learned C debbugging, compiling with debug flags.
 - Learned GDB and tui.
 - Figured out how to debug Gtk.
 - Learned to attach to proccess with GDB, then with Eclipse.
 - Troubleshooting with Eclipse layout (lines not highlighted) 
   -> flush cache fixed issue.
 - Issue: optimized away
     -> recompiled Gtk without optimizations.
 - Stepped through SWT's DnD. ISSUE: no Custom SWT symbols.
 - Figured out how to compile SWT Custom code 
     with debug flags (read build scrpit). 
 - Updated my build script to handle paramaters. (Gtk3/debug)
   -> learned about *getops*
 - Debugged SWT Custom code 
    -> Observed use of Gdk Window. (layer under gtk)
 - STUCK: not much Gdk Info.
    -> Found book from Red Hat guy about Gdk.  Gdk , Realized, mapped, showed, visible.

*** Weekly Report:
Triage:
. [Bug 466112] SWT returns incorrect Monitor client area on GTK
  - Reviewed and tested several patches.
  - Provided feedback on improving some patches (fixing NPE, fixing related methods). 
  - Helped new google guy with building SWT binaries. (I sent him my swtjni build script)

Dev:
. Bug 457476 - [GTK3] DND issue with overlapping widgets w/ absolute positioning.
  - Figured out how to compile SWT Fixed with debug flags and how to debug SWT's custom C code.
  - Learned how to handle mutiple arguments (-g -2) with bash script, updated my swt build script.
  - Reading GDK & GTK+ code base, reading book on advanced GDK+ topics.
  - Learned about Gtk+'s custom object oriented implementation.  
  - Learned about Gdk's lowl level mechanisms (GdkWindows, GdkEvents, Realiztion/mapping/showing/visibility etc..) 
  - Stepped through Gtk/SWT Custom code, identified a potential cause of the issue.
    It appears that the custom SWT class in SWT is missing a function (find-window).
    I.e, normally a sub-container definition overrides this class, but in SWT custom this method
    is missing.
 - Reading book on how GTK+ has implemented it's own Class system, so I could add the missing function.

Docu:
- Updated article on how to idetify if Eclipse runs on Gtk2 or Gtk3, as it's often found by google searches:
 https://coffeeorientedprogramming.wordpress.com/2014/10/27/how-to-tell-if-you-are-running-eclipse-on-gtk2-or-on-gtk3/

*** Weekly report
DEV:
. DnD Overlapping issue: (fix in progress).
  - For the most part I was tracing and narrowing down the issue.
  - Along the way I learned GDK resource management and how to understand 
    memory pointers in C. In Gdk, (because of the lack of a native object 
    hierarchy), it's tricky to figure out what on object variable sometimes
    points to; so I used a combination of GtkInspector and printing out 
    the handles in hex format to locate objects and read their properties. E.g: 
    http://i.imgur.com/smdreds.png
  - I now reached a point where I can effectively read/trace/debug Gdk/Gtk C level code.
    After fixing DnD, I intend to document how to do this in the guide.
  - I re-wrote the testing widget to narrow it down to a very basic test case, 
    (just two overlapping labels). 
  - Eventually I traced it down to swt_fixed_forall(), this function traverses 
    the child objects of the container in a particular order.
    I tested reversing the way the container traverses it's children;
    while this does effectively fix DnD for overlapping for container using absolute positioning,
    it also breaks all other layout mechanisms (Row/Column/Grid/FormAttach etc..). 

OTHER:
. Intern talks/presentations.
. Helped new Intern with Eclipse set up.


This week:
 - I'm now looking for a way to fix DnD without breaking layout of non-absolute containers.

*** Weekly Report
LAST WEEK:
. Received Eclipse SWT committer rights. 

. (FINISHED) Drag and Drop for overlapping widget issue.
  - Improved previous patch, now doesn't break other behavior. (reverse list traversal only for internal widgets).
  - I spent a day thoroughly testing it as it and then submitted it.
  - It took a long time to figure out how to debug Gtk/ native C code in swtFixed,
    and to get acquainted with Gtk's code base. With this learned, it is now easier/faster
    for me to  debug and investigate low-level issues now.
  - Currently awaiting patch to be merged to master.

. (DONE) Bug 458820 - [GTK*][DND] MouseUp event has wrong x and y coordinates on Linux-GTK when drag is enabled 
  - Traced behavior in SWT, narrowed down to values that we receive from Gtk.
  - Wrote native Gtk code that reproduces issue without SWT involvement.
  - This is a bug in Gtk itself rather than SWT. This is also not Gtk3 specific. It occurs on gtk2 also.
  - Submitted bug to Gnome/Gtk, awaiting bugfix from them.

. With the above two out of the way, this completes the Drag & Drop port of SWT to Gtk3.

. (STARTED) Double click in Package explorer triggers incorrect sequence of events.
  - Issue observed in Eclipse. (platformUI level).
  - Reproduced issue on SWT level with small snippet.
  - Now asked to clarify some ambiguity with reporter.

THIS WEEK:
. Document how to debug native Gtk/C code in an SWT/Java application with Eclipse.
. JavaDoc is black issue.
. (maybe) O(n^2) performance/UI freeze-up issue when adding children to tree.

. Releng Copyright tool is slow.
  - Spent sometime configuring environment to get newest Releng to work. 
  - Narrowed down to slow performance when working with git-repositories with long commit histories.
  - Narrowed down performance issue to a call in into jgit (this is an Eclipse plugin).

* Learned so far.
** Productivity 
*** [#A] Stay focused.
*** [#A] Have clear, measurable goals.
*** [#B] Stay Focused on What is important/significant.
At the end of every pomodoro, I should ask myself if what I've done was significant.
*** [#B] Do important things first, mail/rss etc later in the day.
** Learning 
*** [#B] Make learning plan 
Before diving deep into details, make an outline of what you intend to learn.
This way you avoid over-spending time on details that are not important.
I.e, map out what is important to learn for the given problem at hand.
** Notes making
*** [#A] Keep entries short.
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  <2015-05-11 Mon 10:27>

*** Weekly report
THIS WEEK:
. Releng tools
  - Investigated performance issue.
  - Narrowed issue down to a section inside to jgit.
  - This appears to be a limitation of the git technology.
    To find out when a file was modified, one has to traverse the git commit history
    until you find a commit with the file inside it. (1*)
    In the worst case scenario run time is exponential:
        O(files * length-of-git-history) ~= O(n^2) 
  - native 'git log' has similar performance issue.
  - Emailed jgit mailing list to en-quire if this is a known issue and if there
    is some solution for it.

. Help Eric with first assignment 
  - Explained how SWT Tools work, how it copies & compiles native bindings.
  - We worked on a function that has a variable number of arguments in 'C',
    and as such needed special treatment. (Hand hard-coding in os_custom.c).
    It took some time to figure out how to find & write the correct type conversation 
    from java to 'C' and copying byte arrays from java to the OS/JVM.

. SWT Docu 
  - Small incremental updates. Usually when Eric get's stuck on something, I add missing info.

. Learning: 
  - RHCSA  (40 mins/day). 

NEXT WEEK:
. package explorer steals focus on double click. 

(1*) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7714434/how-does-git-file-log-internally-works
*** Wed/Thurs/Fri
. Releng 
  - Performance analysis.
. Package explorer double click 
  - removed old workaround.
  - now investigating eclipse package explorer.
*** Learned 
**** Be humble when teaching people.
I was a bit too 'I know it all' on some occasion with Eric.
It may cause some feeling of dissdain.
I should be humble.

Name: Strength + Power. (Started going to gym).
*** Learned 
**** Success is not just knowledge, but know also how to apply it.
-> I should practice things more.
*** WR (Wednesday)

. (FINISHED) Analysis of Releng performance issue.
  - Finished analysis of performance issue. 
  - Found a method that could potentially speed things up from O(n^2) to O(n)
    (build a hash-map/cache of the git-log prior to traversal)
  - Posted findings into bugzilla 
  - But implementation would take a long time. Moved on to more pressing SWT issues instead.

. (IN PROGRESS) Package explorer double-click steals back focus issue
  Focus was stolen by package-explorer due to two reasons:
  1) I found an 11 year old workaround in the code that stole focus.
     (In the past, Gtk(1?) would crash if focus was not returned to tree after a signal event)
     This workaround is no longer relevant for Gtk2/Gtk3, thus I removed it.
     I read the old commit and found that the workaround was introduced in 
     List/Table as well as Tree widget. I removed the workaround from all widgets &
     tested that nothing crashes on Gtk2/Gtk3.
  2) Order of signal events has issues. Doubleclick event is sent after selection event.
     I wrote a hacky proof-of-concept patch that changes the order and fixes the focus issue.  
  
  I need to further investigate if order of events can be changed on GDK/Gtk level, and if
  absolutley not, then write a thread-wait mechanism to postpone DefaultSelection event in 
  Tree/List/Table widget. (as currently I only do a 50ms thread wait).

. (ON GOING) Eric support 
   - Helped Eric with patches. (GTK_STOCK_OK, gtk_container_resize_children). 
     (this took some time :-D).
   - Assigned some GDK readings to Eric, so that he understands the underlying 
     infrastructure that SWT is build on, so that he develops a 'feel' for 
     which code base to look in during bug hunting.

. Tuseday 
  Away on Volunteering event at Good Shepherd. We helped homeless people.

. Red Hat Certified System Administrator Course
  50 mins/daily. 
  Completed Chp4 (File permissions) now working on Chp5 (SELinux).

*** WR
. (FINISHED) Package explorer double-click steals back focus issue
  - Completed patch that fixes issue for Eclipse on both Gtk2 & Gtk3. 
  - Bug was among top 5 voted bugs in STW, open 5 years ago with 17 up votes.
  - Implementation details (see [1])

. (IN PROGRESS) Researched pixman_region32_init_rect warning in logs. 
    -> could not reproduce (F23 w/ latest eclipse). 
    -> in contact with Alex about details. 

. (IN PROGRESS) replace deprecated: GtkCellRenderer:cell-background-gdk.
   - Community reports a lots crashes in theaming engines when they 
   read background. (e.g highest voted bug in SWT bugzilla 421073 w/ 31 votes).
   - In Fedora 23, there are many background related glitches as non-css 
     methods for setting background are getting removed.
   - I suspect that our current use of deprecated background color properties
     and functions is causing this. As such I'm working on removing these deprecated calls.

. (ON GOING) Help Eric.
  - gave lesson on GtkCSS, GdkColor vs GdkRGBA & SWT Color and other.
  - helped him with general tasks / questions.
  - Reviewed his patch:  [gtk3] Replace deprecated gdk_cursor_new

. RHCSA  50mins/day.

[1]: Implementation details (if interested..):
    - Issue caused by in-correct order of signals (& an 11 year old workaround).
    - Clarified order-of-events details with Gtk+ community on irc.
       (order of events cannot be changed on Gdk level). 
    - Rewrote sections of SWT (Tree/Table/List) so that instead of handling 
      a row-activation GdkSignal, SWT generates the signal manually.
      so as to implement correct order of signals.
    - There were some tricky bits, e.g DefaultSelection is sent 
      for "Space", "Shift+space", "return", but not for things like "Ctrl+return",
      I.e, I had to make sure that our emulated signal behaves exactly as the
      former row-activation signal behaved in Gdk.
    - I found mapping out signal behaviour was very helpful. E.g diagram I made 
      in the proccess:

. Triage 
  .  Bug 470403 - [GTK] Tabel content not visible if EditingSupport is used
    - Lars Vogella submitted a critical bug that table-cells are not propertly 
      visible when editing. He pointed to an jFace snippet.
    - Investigated issue. Haven't been able to reproduce on lower level SWT snippet, 
      and other similar jFace snippets do not expose the behaviour either. 
      It might be specific to that jFace snippet.
    - Awaiting feedback from Vogella, but he is away on Vaccation now.

. Fix/Improve setup:
  - Fixed my Gtk debug setup (it broke on F22 upgrade due to permissions).
  - Working on finding a method to break & debug upon warnings in Eclipse console. 
    This would allow us to locate the sourse of many mysterious console warnings.
  - I will document the above in the SWT guide later on.

. Eric suppor:
 - Reviewed some of Eric's patches & provided feedback (Color Dialog etc.. )

*** Weekly report
This week:
. (FINISHED) Bug 470629 [ATK] Replace deprecated atk_role_register
   - Replaced deprecated call with values advised by atk maintainers.
   - This involved adding support for calling functions dynamically in the
     ATK custom C code (for version checking).
   - Tested with orca screen reader and accerrciser. All works well. 
   - This was a warning that showed up for both gtk2 & gtk3.
     Now Gtk2 (finally) compiles without any deprecation warnings.
   (And Gtk3 with one less warning).

. (FINISHED) Bug 471477 - Add SWT_FATAL_WARNINGS environmental variable.
   - Wrote a patch so that we can make eclipse break/debug when there is a 
     console warning.
     Debugging can be done via 'gdb --pid=1234' or from inside Eclipse.
   - This can be enabled via: SWT_FATAL_WARNINGS=1 variable now.
   - Will write up more through documentation once patch is in master.

. (STARTED) Equinox launcher port from xlib to wayland. 
  ~ Figuring out what I have to do ~
    - Reading source code, researching what is xlib/wayland. 
    - Investigating how to compile, compile with debug and running launcher.
    - Pinged Marc/Sravan for tips/advice. Will ping Arun later also.
      Marc replied with good info on how to compile with debug support.

. (ONGOING) Help Eric 
    - Reviewed & tested ColorDialog patch. 
    - Helped with gtk_image_menu project.
    - Ad-Hoc support, e.g showed how to enable 32/64 bit checks etc.. 

. (ALSO IN THE NEWS) 
  - Spent time figuring out why my gdb would no longer debug native SWT C code
    on fedora 22. Nothing would start in Eclipse. In GDB I got an error:
    "ptrace : operation not permitted"
    Eventually narrowed down to known issue:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1209492
    In touch with RHEL/Fedora maintainers.
    They started a build with bugfix that I could test.

  - Took day off on Friday, work on Canada-Day (wednesday) instead. 
    I'm the only guy in the office, ~> very productive.

*** Weekly Report.
SWT:
This Week:
. (IN PROGRESS) Equinox x11 to Wayland Port.
  - Reading related bugs, e.g SWT port from X11 to Wayland.
  - Contacted author (Josh Barkovic) for insights. 
    Insights are very useful:
    E.g Wayland doesn't fully replace 'X'. 
      X is getting deprecated beacuse it's too big.
      Wayland only provides the interface to the graphics, 
      Gtk/Cairo handle much of what X used to do. 
      For instance Gtk handles keyboard/mouse, Cairo handles drawings.
      This means the migration is not so much about X to Wayland, 
      but more from X to various libraries like Waynad/Gtk/Cairo/etc...
  - Investigating realted projects. (Libre Office & FF Wayland ports).

. (FYI)  Bug 1245759 – Attach-process does not work. "ptrace: Operation not permitted"
   - In F22, in Eclipse-CDT, attaching to processes no longer works. 
   - This is due to a change in SELinux that affects Eclipse.
   - There is an active discussion between Security and Usibility advocates.
   - They asked to see who is actually affected by the change, 
     I submitted a bug in RHEL Bugzilla to provide them with info:
     https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1245759

. (FIXED) atk_role_register broke build issue. See [1]
. (INVESTIGATED) Double click doesn't work on dark theme issue. See [2] 

. (LEARNED) How to use Mylyn for Gerrit reviews & tracking SWT Bugs.
            Now my workflow for Bugs & Gerrit reviews is inside Eclipse
            as oppose to using a browser.
            Taught Eric the above.
. (INVESTIGATED) Mylyn Query issue on Fedora.  See [3]

. (NEW) SWT Documentation now in Eclipse Wiki. See [4]

. (COMPLETED) Reviewing Eric's outstanding Patches [5]

Next Week:
. Continue with Equinox port 
. Test MyLyn on Rawhide with Alexe's latest patches 



Details if interested:
[1] ATK  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=470629
  - Previous patch broke the build on older OS's. 
  - Wrote patch that works across any OS now.
  - It checks for Gtk version instead of Atk version as 
    Gtk has minimum Atk version requirements.

[2]  473093: [Gtk 3.14] Selection of items in lists need focus on view first
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=473093
  - User submitted bug report, where it was believed that my previous 
    "double-click to focus" patch broke dark theme (bug 312568).
  - Investigated, tested with/without my patch. 
    Tested across several GTK versions and determined
    that it was not related to my patch. 
  - Pointed out it may be related to Platform.U.I.
  - Sopot narrowed issue down to Eclipse's CSS.

[3] Bug 1244934 – 'Task List Indexer has encountered a problem' - document contains at least one immense term..
  - Querying SWT bugs in mylyn produces an error.
  - Narrowed it down to Mylyn specific in Fedora, 
    (doesn't occur upstream).
  - Submitted bug report.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1244934

[4] - Me & Eric now add new articles to the Eclipse Wikipedia under SWT:
    https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT/Devel/Gtk
  - This is to replace the original SWT-Dev guide in my Git-repo, 
    http://leoufimtsev.github.io./org/swt-dev.html
    Mainly because it's easier to collaborate on the Eclipse wiki.
  . New Articles:
    - Wayland Development.
    - Atk Development.

[5] . Color Dialog patch. 
    . Stock OK Patch.
    . Toolbars too large patch
    . Icons for menus patch.
      - Several review cycles 
      - Reviewing this took a long time. Big patch. (5 hours...))
      - Outlined issues that would cause crashes and made suggestions
        to deduplicate sections of code.

[2015-08-04 Tue 17:26]:  Instead of swapping functions, make new with Gtk
[2015-08-05 Wed 12:04]:  atk non-ascii char. Wrote script to check for such issues, added wiki article
*** Weekly Report 
- (IN PROGRESS) Equinox X11 to Wayland port 
  - Making steady progess. 
  - Learned some X11 to understand existing functions better.
    (e.g check out source code). 
  - Figured out how to inject compiled Equinox/SO files into 
    existing Eclipse, how to debug compiled Equinox etc.. 
  - Spent some time researching what X11 functions map onto, 
    but it doesn't look like they map onto Gdk that well. 
    Instead I plan to do a split and use seperate logic for Gtk3.
  - Documenting what I learn about Equinox development as I go along: 
    (Compiling/debugging etc..)
    https://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/dev

- Patch reviews 
  - Eric Toolbar patch, observed warnings in console 
  - & other Eric's pathes. 
  - Reviewed patch for:  Bug 472743 - [GTK2] Shell.setBounds()
     > Made a suggestion to improve patch further.

- Testing 
  - Garbled text in commit plane

. non-Ascii char issue 
  - One of my patches contained a non-ascii character, 
  - Alex pointed out it issued a build warning.
  - Wrote a script to find non-ascii characters in code base 
    in the future, documented it:
    https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT/Devel/Gtk/NonAsciiCharacters

- FYI:
  . "1209492: BUG: Yama blocks ptrace'ing my own process"
    - Patch that broke gdb attach-proccess is getting reverted.
    - The 'loosening of security' will become a seperate package. 
    - Now Mark and Paul argue about package naming (+20 comments) (~BZ now 80 Comments long).
    - Awaiting till they make a decision and patch is ready so I can test it.

- Migrated from Zimbra to Gmail.
** OPEN Week 32-33
